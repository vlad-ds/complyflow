      "raw_snippet": "This Master Agreement is made as of the 26 day of January, 2007 (the \"Effective Date\"), by and between Oriental Financial Group Inc., a Puerto Rico financial holding company (\"Customer\"), and Metavante Corporation, a Wisconsin corporation (\"Metavante\").",
      "reasoning": "The parties are clearly identified in the opening sentence of the agreement as the two entities entering into this contract.",

      "reasoning": "While titled 'Technology Outsourcing Agreement', the core substance involves Metavante providing extensive technology services including data processing, software hosting, payment processing, ACH services, card services, and related technology services to Oriental Financial Group. The primary obligation is service provision by Metavante in exchange for fees. This is fundamentally an outsourcing arrangement where Customer transfers its technology operations to Metavante.",

      "reasoning": "This clause specifies the notice period required to prevent automatic renewal. Customer must provide notice within 3 months after receiving Metavante's Renewal Notice (which is sent 12 months before expiration).

      "raw_snippet": "THIS AGREEMENT (\"Agreement\"), entered into on May 20, 1992, is between Arkansas Western Pipeline Company (\"Transporter\"), an Arkansas corporation, and Associated Natural Gas Company, a division of Arkansas Western Gas Company, (\"Shipper\");",
      "reasoning": "The parties are identified in the opening paragraph of the agreement, which explicitly names the two entities entering into the contract with their roles in parentheses.",

        "Arkansas Western Pipeline Company",

      "raw_snippet": "TRANSPORTATION SERVICE AGREEMENT UNDER RATE SCHEDULE FTS OR ITS ... Transporter agrees to transport and redeliver and Shipper agrees to accept delivery of the Equivalent Quantities of gas at the Point(s) of Delivery ... Shipper shall pay Transporter for the service hereunder an amount determined in accordance with Transporter's FTS/ITS Rate Schedule",
      "reasoning": "The agreement is titled 'Transportation Service Agreement' and the core obligation is for the Transporter to transport natural gas on behalf of the Shipper from receipt points to delivery points in exchange for transportation fees. This is a classic transportation services arrangement where one party moves goods for another party for a fee.",

      "raw_snippet": "Thereafter, this Agreement shall be effective month to month, until terminated by Transporter or Shipper upon the following written notice to the other specifying a termination date: sixty (60) days for interruptible transportation under Rate Schedule ITS and 180 days for firm transportation under Rate Schedule FTS.",
      "reasoning": "Article V Section 5.1 specifies the notice period required to terminate the month-to-month continuation after the primary term expires. Since the contract involves firm transportation under Rate Schedule FTS (as indicated by the MDQ of 23,000 Dth and references to firm service), the applicable notice period is 180 days.",

      "raw_snippet": "this Agreement shall be effective as of the date of physical completion of and initial deliveries on Transporter's pipeline and shall continue for a primary term of ten years.",
      "reasoning": "Article V Section 5.1 specifies a primary term of ten years from the effective date, which is the date of physical completion and initial deliveries. This is a relative term that depends on when the pipeline becomes operational, not a fixed calendar date.",

      "reasoning": "Article V Section 5.1 indicates that after the primary ten-year term, the agreement continues on a month-to-month basis rather than for fixed renewal periods. This is an automatic continuation structure rather than a fixed-term renewal.",

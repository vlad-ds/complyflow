University hereby grants to ArTara an exclusive license to use the Program Data solely for the Project and in Regulatory Filings in the Field in the Territory.\n\n4.3 Right of Reference and IND Assignment. University hereby grants to ArTara an exclusive Right of Reference to all Program Regulatory Filings by University in support of the Product.",
      "reasoning": "While the title suggests both research and licensing components, the primary economic substance is the exclusive license granted by University to ArTara for Program Data and regulatory filings. The sponsored research component (Phase I-V) is a supporting activity to facilitate the main purpose: granting ArTara exclusive rights to use the Program Data for regulatory approvals. The payment structure (royalties on Net Sales, milestone payments) is characteristic of a license agreement. The research is being sponsored to support the licensed use of data.",

      "reasoning": "This agreement does not contain an automatic renewal provision that requires advance notice to prevent renewal. Article 8.1 states 'This Agreement may be terminated by ArTara upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to University' and Section 8.2 states 'Either Party may terminate the Project and all commitments and obligations with respect thereto, subject to Section 8.3 herein, upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other Party.' These are general termination provisions, not notice periods to prevent automatic renewal. The agreement does not specify an initial term that auto-renews unless notice is given.",

      "reasoning": "The agreement does not specify an expiration date or initial term. Article 8 addresses termination rights but does not establish when the agreement naturally expires. Section 8.1 allows ArTara to terminate upon 30 days notice, and Section 8.2 allows either party to terminate the Project upon 30 days notice, but there is no stated term or expiration date for the agreement itself. The agreement appears to continue until terminated by a party.",

      "reasoning": "The agreement does not contain any renewal provisions. There is no language indicating that the agreement automatically renews for successive terms or that either party has the option to renew. The agreement only addresses termination rights in Article 8, not renewal.",

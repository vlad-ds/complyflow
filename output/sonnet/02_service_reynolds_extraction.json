      "reasoning": "This agreement does not have an auto-renewal provision that requires notice to prevent renewal. Each service has a fixed Term that expires after a specified period (mostly 12 or 24 months from Commencement Date) and the services terminate at the end of their Term. Section 6.1 states services continue 'until 12 months following the Commencement Date unless (i) such other date as is specified as the termination date for any applicable Service in this Agreement or on Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable (the \"Term\") or (ii) earlier terminated pursuant to this Agreement.' Section 6.2 allows for early termination for convenience with 30 days' notice, but this is a termination provision, not a notice to prevent renewal. The agreement terminates when all services have reached their Termination Date (Section 6.3), without any auto-renewal mechanism requiring advance notice to prevent.",

    "expiration_date": {
      "raw_snippet": "With respect to each of the Services, the term thereof will be for a period commencing as of the date hereof, unless a different date is specified as the commencement date for any applicable Service on Exhibit A or Exhibit B (either, a \"Commencement Date\"), and shall continue until 12 months following the Commencement Date unless (i) such other date as is specified as the termination date for any applicable Service in this Agreement or on Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable (the \"Term\") or (ii) earlier terminated pursuant to this Agreement (a \"Termination Date\").",
      "reasoning": "The agreement does not have a single expiration date. Instead, each service has its own Term specified in Exhibits A and B, ranging from 12 to 24 months from the applicable Commencement Date. The overall agreement terminates when all individual services have reached their Termination Dates. Since the Commencement Date is specified as February 4, 2020, and most services run for 12 or 24 months, the expiration dates are relative to that date. However, different services have different terms, so there is no single expiration date for the entire agreement.",

      "reasoning": "The agreement does not contain any renewal provisions. Section 6.1 specifies that each service continues for its specified Term and then terminates. Section 6.3 states 'This Agreement shall terminate when the Termination Date has occurred for all Services.' There is no language providing for automatic renewal or any renewal term. The agreement is structured as a fixed-term transition arrangement to facilitate the separation of the parties, not as a renewable ongoing relationship.",

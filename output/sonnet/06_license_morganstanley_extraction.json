      "reasoning": "While titled as a Trademark License Agreement, the substance confirms this is a license agreement. The core obligation is Licensor granting Licensee the right to use the \"Morgan Stanley\" trademark and design (the Brand) in exchange for compliance with quality standards and other conditions.

      "reasoning": "The contract does not contain a notice period to prevent renewal. Section 4.1 states the agreement continues \"in perpetuity\" unless terminated under specific conditions (convenience, breach, or termination of advisory agreement). There is no automatic renewal mechanism that requires advance notice to prevent renewal. The termination provisions in Sections 4.2-4.4 are for ending the agreement, not for preventing renewal.",

The agreement can only end through termination provisions (for convenience, breach, or termination of the underlying advisory agreement), not through expiration and renewal.",

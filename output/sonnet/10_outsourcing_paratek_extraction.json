      "reasoning": "While the title states 'Outsourcing Agreement', examining the substance reveals this is fundamentally a manufacturing agreement. The core obligations involve Supplier manufacturing and supplying Product to Customer according to specifications, with detailed provisions about manufacturing processes, quality standards, testing, delivery, and fees for manufactured goods. Section 3.1 states 'Supplier shall Manufacture the Product' and Section 3.2 refers to 'Manufacturing Services'. The economic substance is the manufacture and supply of pharmaceutical products, making this a Manufacturing Agreement despite the 'Outsourcing' title.",

      "raw_snippet": "Customer delivers written notice of termination to Supplier at least [* * *] prior to the expiration date of the Initial Term, which termination shall be effective as of the expiration date of the Initial Term",
      "reasoning": "Section 18.1(a) describes the notice requirement to terminate at the end of the Initial Term. The specific number of days/months is redacted [* * *], but this is the notice period to prevent continuation beyond the Initial Term. Section 18.1(b) contains similar language for the Renewal Term with a different redacted notice period.",

The contract states it commences on December 30, 2016 (the Effective Date) and continues for a redacted period. Since the specific term length is redacted, I cannot provide the normalized value.",

      "reasoning": "Section 2.1 describes that if the parties don't reach a follow-on agreement by a certain date, this Agreement automatically continues for a maximum period (the Renewal Term). The specific durations are redacted [* * *]. This describes an automatic renewal mechanism contingent on not reaching a new agreement, but the actual renewal period is redacted.",

Subject to the terms and conditions mentioned hereunder, the Parties agree to the outsource model based on [***]... Suppliers will make good faith efforts to accept all [***]from the Company... The purchase price for the Product shall be as set forth in Schedule 2.",
      "reasoning": "This is substantively an outsourcing agreement where the Company receives purchase orders from customers and outsources the manufacturing of photomasks to the Suppliers (Photronics, DNP, and PDMC). The primary economic substance is the outsourcing of production work, with detailed provisions for purchase orders, allocation rules, pricing, delivery, and warranty terms. While it has supply agreement elements, the core relationship is outsourcing production capacity.",

      "reasoning": "The agreement does not contain any notice period requirement to prevent automatic renewal. Article 7.1 states the agreement continues 'for so long as Photronics and DNP, or any of their Affiliates, each remains a Shareholder of the Company' - this is a perpetual term tied to ownership status, not a renewable term requiring notice to prevent renewal. Section 7.2 provides for termination for cause with 30 days to cure, but this is not a notice period to prevent renewal.",

      "reasoning": "Article 7.1 specifies the term of the agreement. The agreement does not have a fixed expiration date but rather continues indefinitely based on a condition (continued shareholding). This is not the same as 'perpetual' language - it's contingent on the shareholding relationship continuing. Since there is no fixed term or explicit perpetual language, and the duration is tied to an external condition, this is best represented as an empty string as it doesn't fit the standard expiration date patterns.",

      "reasoning": "The agreement in Article 7.1 states it continues 'for so long as Photronics and DNP, or any of their Affiliates, each remains a Shareholder of the Company.' This is not a renewal term structure but rather a continuous term tied to a condition. There is no provision for periodic renewal (e.g., automatic 1-year renewals). The agreement simply continues based on the shareholding condition.",

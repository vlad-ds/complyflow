    "notice_period": {
      "raw_snippet": "",
      "reasoning": "This agreement does not contain a notice period to prevent automatic renewal. Article 7.1 states the agreement continues 'for so long as Photronics and DNP, or any of their Affiliates, each remains a Shareholder of the Company,' which is a condition-based term, not a renewal mechanism requiring notice to prevent renewal. Section 7.2 provides for termination with 30 days cure period after breach, but this is a termination-for-cause provision, not a notice to prevent renewal.",

      "reasoning": "Article 7.1 specifies that the agreement continues indefinitely based on a condition (shareholder status) rather than a fixed date. This is not perpetual in the explicit sense, but rather condition-based. Since there is no specific expiration date and the term is tied to shareholder status, I describe this as a relative term based on the condition.",

      "reasoning": "The agreement does not contain any renewal provisions. Article 7.1 establishes that the agreement continues based on the condition of shareholder status, not through renewal mechanisms. There is no language about automatic renewal periods or renewal terms.",

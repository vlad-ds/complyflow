In connection with a securitization transaction sponsored by Cellco in which the Issuer will issue Notes secured by a pool of Receivables consisting of device payment plan agreements, certain of the Originators and/or the Master Trust have transferred a pool of Receivables and related property, and any of the Originators and/or the Master Trust may from time to time transfer additional pools of Receivables and related property to the Depositor, who will transfer them to the Issuer. The Issuer will engage the Servicer to service the Receivables.",
      "reasoning": "This is a securitization agreement where the Depositor transfers receivables to the Issuer, and Cellco is engaged to service those receivables. The primary economic substance involves the servicing of receivables for an asset-backed securities transaction. The servicer is being engaged to manage, service, administer and collect on receivables. This is fundamentally a service agreement where Cellco provides servicing, custodian, and marketing agent services for the securitization structure.",

The agreement has a specific termination structure tied to the Amortization Period and Final Maturity Date, with optional redemption provisions. There is no automatic renewal mechanism that requires advance notice to prevent renewal.

While the agreement may technically continue until all receivables are settled per Section 8.3, the substantive obligations related to the Notes expire on the Final Maturity Date.

There are optional redemption provisions in Sections 8.1 and 8.2, but no renewal term.

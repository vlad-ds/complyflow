      "raw_snippet": "the undersigned, the Integrity Short Term Government Fund, (the \"Fund\"), an open-end, diversified, management investment company organized as a series of The Integrity Funds, a Delaware statutory trust, has agreed that Integrity Funds Distributor, LLC, (\"Integrity\"), shall be, for the period of this distribution agreement",
      "reasoning": "The parties are identified in the opening paragraph of the agreement, which names both the Fund and the Distributor as the contracting parties. The signature block confirms these parties with Shannon D. Radke signing on behalf of both entities.",

      "raw_snippet": "DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICES AGREEMENT ... Integrity will act as principal underwriter for the distribution of the Shares ... Integrity agrees to use its best efforts to solicit orders for the sale of the Shares at the public offering price ... Integrity may allow commissions or concessions to dealers",
      "reasoning": "While titled a 'Distribution and Services Agreement', the substance of the contract establishes Integrity as the principal underwriter and distributor for the Fund's shares. The primary obligation is distribution of investment fund shares, with Integrity acting as the exclusive distributor soliciting orders, working with dealers, and receiving commissions. This is fundamentally a distributor arrangement where one party is appointed to distribute products (shares) of another.",

    "notice_period": {
      "raw_snippet": "",
      "reasoning": "Section 7.1 specifies that the agreement continues automatically for successive annual periods 'provided such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (a) the Fund's Board of Trustees and (b) a vote of a majority...of the Fund's Trustees'. The renewal mechanism requires affirmative Board approval rather than notice to prevent renewal. While there are notice periods for termination (60 days by Fund, 90 days by Integrity), these are for terminating the agreement, not for preventing automatic renewal. Since renewal requires affirmative action (Board approval) rather than being automatic unless notice is given, there is no 'notice period to terminate renewal' in the traditional sense.",

    },
    "expiration_date": {
      "raw_snippet": "This Agreement shall continue until January 18, 2022",
      "reasoning": "Section 7.1 explicitly states that the agreement continues until a specific calendar date: January 18, 2022. After this initial term, it may continue for successive annual periods subject to Board approval.",

      "raw_snippet": "This Agreement shall continue until January 18, 2022, and thereafter shall continue automatically for successive annual periods ending on January 18th of each year, provided such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (a) the Fund's Board of Trustees and (b) a vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund's Trustees",
      "reasoning": "Section 7.1 specifies that after the initial term ending January 18, 2022, the agreement continues automatically for successive annual periods. However, this automatic continuation is conditional upon specific annual approval by the Board of Trustees and qualified trustees. The renewal term is annual (one year periods), though it requires affirmative action rather than being purely automatic.",

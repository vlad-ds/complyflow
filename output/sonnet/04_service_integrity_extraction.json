      "raw_snippet": "This Agreement is terminable with respect to the Fund, without penalty, (a) on 60 days' written notice, by vote of a majority of the Qualified Trustees or by vote of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund or (b) on 90 days' written notice by Integrity.",
      "reasoning": "Section 7.1 specifies the notice periods required for termination. However, this relates to general termination at will, not specifically to preventing automatic renewal. The agreement states it 'shall continue automatically for successive annual periods' but requires annual board approval rather than notice to prevent renewal. Therefore, there is no notice period to terminate renewal in the traditional sense.",

      "reasoning": "Section 7.1 describes the renewal mechanism. After the initial term, the agreement renews annually on January 18th, subject to annual board approval. The renewal is automatic if approved but requires specific board action.",

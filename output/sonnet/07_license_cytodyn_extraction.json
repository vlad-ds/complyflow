      "raw_snippet": "This Commercialization and License Agreement (this \"Agreement\") is made effective as of December 17, 2019 (the \"Effective Date\") by and between Vyera Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"Vyera\"), and CytoDyn Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"CytoDyn\").",

      "raw_snippet": "COMMERCIALIZATION AND LICENSE AGREEMENT",
      "reasoning": "The title of the agreement clearly indicates this is a commercialization and license agreement. Given the structure where CytoDyn grants Vyera exclusive rights to commercialize licensed products in exchange for royalties and milestones, this falls under License Agreement.",
      "normalized_value": "License Agreement"

    "notice_period": {
      "raw_snippet": "",
      "reasoning": "The agreement does not contain an automatic renewal provision that requires notice to prevent renewal. Under Section 11.1, the term expires 'on the last day of the Royalty Term' and the agreement does not automatically renew. While Section 11.2(c) allows Vyera to terminate 'at any time following the second (2nd) anniversary of the First Commercial Sale of the Licensed Product, for any reason or no reason, upon one hundred eighty (180) days' written notice', this is a general termination provision, not a notice period to prevent automatic renewal.",

      "raw_snippet": "The term of this Agreement (\"Term\") shall commence upon the Effective Date and, unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Article 11, shall expire on the last day of the Royalty Term.",
      "reasoning": "The expiration is tied to the end of the Royalty Term, which is defined in Section 1.94 as 'the time period beginning with the First Commercial Sale of the Licensed Product in the Territory and continuing until the latest of (a) the expiration of the last Valid Claim Covering the Licensed Product and included in a CytoDyn Patent licensed to Vyera under this Agreement, (b) the date that is ten (10) years from the date of the First Commercial Sale, (c) the expiration of any Regulatory Exclusivity with respect to the Licensed Product and (d) the Biosimilar Entry Date.' This is contingent on future events and cannot be calculated to a specific date.",

    },
    "renewal_term": {
      "raw_snippet": "",
      "reasoning": "The agreement does not contain any renewal provisions. Section 11.1 states the term expires on the last day of the Royalty Term without any provision for automatic or optional renewal. Upon expiration, the license simply becomes 'non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty free, perpetual and irrevocable' but this is not a renewal of the agreement itself.",

Constellation desires to provide to the HOF Entities, and the HOF Entities desire to obtain from Constellation, certain of Constellation's products and services... Constellation desires to become a sponsor of the Village and to obtain the rights set forth herein in connection with such sponsorship... ARTICLE 1 SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS & SERVICES... ARTICLE 3 SPONSORSHIP RIGHTS AND BENEFITS... For the advertising and other rights described herein, Constellation shall pay to the HOF Entities total combined sponsorship fees",
      "reasoning": "While titled 'Sponsorship and Services Agreement', the contract has dual purposes: (1) Constellation providing energy products and services to the HOF Entities, and (2) Constellation receiving sponsorship rights in exchange for sponsorship fees. However, the primary economic substance appears to be the sponsorship arrangement, as evidenced by the extensive sponsorship rights detailed in Article 3 and Exhibit E, the payment of sponsorship fees in Section 3.4, and the fact that the products/services are sold separately at market prices rather than being the primary consideration. The sponsorship is the main transaction, with the services being an additional commercial relationship.",

There are various termination provisions in Section 4.2 for breach, reputational damage, and failure to recover investment, but none of these relate to preventing automatic renewal.

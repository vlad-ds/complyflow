Appointment. Client appoints Agent as its transfer agent, registrar and dividend disbursing agent and Agent accepts such appointment in accordance with and subject to the following terms and conditions for all authorized shares of each class of stock listed in Exhibit A hereto (the \"Shares\"). 3. Duties of Agent. Commencing on the Effective Date, Agent shall provide the services listed in Exhibit B hereto, in the performance of its duties hereunder.",
      "reasoning": "The agreement is titled 'Service Agreement for Transfer Agent Services' and Section 1 explicitly appoints the Agent to provide transfer agent, registrar, and dividend disbursing services. Section 3 references services in Exhibit B. The core substance is the provision of specialized financial services (transfer agent services) in exchange for fees, making this a Service Agreement rather than an Agency Agreement (which typically involves sales/business development representation).",

      "reasoning": "Section 2 establishes that the agreement runs for three years from the Effective Date.

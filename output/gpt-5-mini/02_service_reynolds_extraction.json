    "notice_period": {
      "raw_snippet": "",
      "reasoning": "I searched for language that creates an automatic renewal and a specific advance notice period required to prevent renewal. The Agreement sets fixed service terms (generally 12 months) and provides termination-for-convenience notice (e.g., 30 days for certain terminations) but does not contain an automatic renewal clause nor a notice-to-prevent-renewal provision. Therefore there is no notice period to prevent automatic renewal to extract.",

      "reasoning": "Section 6.1 explicitly defines the general term/expiration for each Service as continuing until 12 months following the Commencement Date, while also noting that certain Services may specify different dates on the Exhibits. This is the operative statement of term/expiration.",

      "raw_snippet": "",

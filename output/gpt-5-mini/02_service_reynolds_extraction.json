      "reasoning": "The preamble identifies the two contracting entities by name and corporate form and uses the conventional 'between <Party A> and <Party B>' phrasing to name the parties to the Agreement.",

In order to facilitate the separation of the Company and its Affiliates from RGHI and its Affiliates, (i) RGHI will provide, or cause its Affiliates to\nprovide, certain services to the Company and its Affiliates, and (ii) the Company will provide, or cause its Affiliates to provide, certain services to RGHI\nand its Affiliates, all on the terms and conditions set forth herein.",
      "reasoning": "The core economic substance is reciprocal provision of transitional services to facilitate separation following the Commencement Date. The primary obligations are service provision (Transition Services and Reverse Transition Services), so the agreement is properly classified as a Service Agreement.",

      "reasoning": "The contract contains termination-for-convenience notice periods (e.g., Section 6.2 provides 30 days' prior written notice to terminate specific Services), but it contains no language about automatic renewal or an advance notice required to prevent automatic renewal of the agreement. Because this field specifically asks for the notice period to prevent automatic renewal, and no such renewal-notice language exists, the field is left empty.",

      "raw_snippet": "Section 6.1 Term of Services. With respect to each of the Services, the term thereof will be for a period commencing as of the date hereof, unless a\ndifferent date is specified as the commencement date for any applicable Service on Exhibit A or Exhibit B (either, a \u201cCommencement Date\u201d), and shall\ncontinue until 12 months following the Commencement Date unless (i) such other date as is specified as the termination date for any applicable Service in\nthis Agreement or on Exhibit A or Exhibit B, as applicable (the \u201cTerm\u201d) or (ii) earlier terminated pursuant to this Agreement (a \u201cTermination Date\u201d).",
      "reasoning": "Section 6.1 sets out the general term for Services: they run from the Commencement Date and continue until '12 months following the Commencement Date' unless a different termination date is specified for a particular Service in the Exhibits or earlier termination applies.

      "reasoning": "This paragraph expressly identifies the contracting parties, their legal forms and the capacities in which they act. It appears in the introductory recitals and names the Issuer, the Depositor and Cellco (the Servicer/Marketing Agent/Custodian).",

      "raw_snippet": "The Issuer will engage the Servicer to service the Receivables.",
      "reasoning": "Although the document title is 'Transfer and Servicing Agreement', the core economic substance is that the Issuer acquires pools of receivables and engages Cellco to service those receivables (collection, administration, reporting, etc.). That makes this primarily a services arrangement (servicing of receivables).",

      "raw_snippet": "",
      "reasoning": "I searched for any clause that creates an automatic renewal and an advance notice requirement to prevent renewal. The agreement contains termination, resignation and replacement provisions, and termination on final payment, but it does not contain language describing an automatic renewal term requiring advance notice to prevent renewal. Therefore there is no \"notice period to prevent automatic renewal\" to extract.",

      "reasoning": "Section 8.3 explicitly states when the Agreement terminates \u2014 it is tied to the final payment/settlement/write-off of the last Receivable or termination of the Issuer under the Trust Agreement. This is a relative/contingent termination provision rather than a fixed calendar date.",

The term of this Agreement (\u201cTerm\u201d) shall commence upon the Effective Date and, unless earlier terminated pursuant to this Article 11, shall expire on the last day of the Royalty Term. Upon the expiration of the Royalty Term, the license granted to Vyera under Section 2.1 of this Agreement shall become non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty free, perpetual and irrevocable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Vyera exercises the Continuation Right (as defined in the Supply Agreement), then Vyera shall continue to purchase Licensed Product from CytoDyn pursuant to the Supply Agreement and shall pay CytoDyn for such Licensed Product the price specified in the Supply Agreement and a royalty equal to [***], provided that after the exercise of the Continuation Right, CytoDyn will not be obligated to supply Licensed Product exclusively to Vyera in the Field in the Territory.\n\n1.94 \u201cRoyalty Term\u201d means the time period beginning with the First Commercial Sale of the Licensed Product in the Territory and continuing until the latest of (a) the expiration of the last Valid Claim Covering the Licensed Product and included in a CytoDyn Patent licensed to Vyera under this Agreement, (b) the date that is ten (10) years from the date of the First Commercial Sale, (c) the expiration of any Regulatory Exclusivity with respect to the Licensed Product and (d) the Biosimilar Entry Date.",

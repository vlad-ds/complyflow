      "reasoning": "The document header identifies the agreement as an 'Outsourcing Agreement'. Substantively, the agreement obligates Supplier to Manufacture and supply Product and perform related Services for Customer (see Article 3: Supply of Product, Manufacturing Services, and numerous supply/ purchase order/fee provisions), which aligns with an outsourcing/manufacturing/supply relationship. The title 'Outsourcing Agreement' is the clearest primary-purpose indicator.",

      "reasoning": "Section 18.1(a) is the clause that requires advance written notice to terminate at the end of the Initial Term (i.e., to prevent automatic continuation/renewal). The required period is redacted ([* * *]) so the specific notice length cannot be determined from the text.",

Both Parties shall use reasonably\ndiligent efforts to come to a subsequent long-term agreement, including good faith negotiations regarding minimum volume-based Product\ncommitments from Customer to Supplier, no later than [* * *] to replace this Agreement and serve as a long-term supply agreement between the\nParties. Should the Parties have not agreed to the following agreement by [* * *], this Agreement shall automatically stay in force for a maximum of\n[* * *] (unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties or as otherwise set forth in Section 18.1(a)) or until the Parties have signed the follow-on\nagreement (the \u201cRenewal Term\u201d).",
      "reasoning": "Section 2.1 defines the term: the Agreement starts on the Effective Date and runs until the end of the 'Initial Term', but the actual Initial Term duration is redacted ([* * *]). The clause also describes an automatic continuation mechanism (the 'Renewal Term') with its length redacted.

HOFV and/or PFHOF, on the one hand, and Constellation, on the other hand, are referred to herein as a \u201cParty\u201d and, collectively, as the \u201cParties\u201d.",

      "reasoning": "The document title describes the agreement as a 'Sponsorship and Services' agreement and the WHEREAS clause expressly states Constellation's desire to become a sponsor and obtain sponsorship rights. Substantively the contract grants sponsorship/branding rights to Constellation in exchange for sponsorship fees and also sets out Constellation's obligation to provide products and services (energy-related supply and services). The primary commercial exchange centers on sponsorship/branding rights plus related service/supply obligations, so 'Sponsorship Agreement' best captures the primary purpose.",

      "raw_snippet": "This Outsourcing Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is made and entered into as of January 1, 1998, by and between Sykes HealthPlan Services, Inc., a Florida corporation (\"SHPS\"), and HealthPlan Services, Inc., a Florida corporation (\"HPS\").",
      "reasoning": "The opening recital identifies the contracting parties using the phrase \"by and between\" and names the two corporate entities along with their short-form abbreviations. This is the clearest statement of the parties to the agreement.",

        "Sykes HealthPlan Services, Inc.",
        "HealthPlan Services, Inc."

      "raw_snippet": "1.1 AGREEMENT TO OUTSOURCE CARE MANAGEMENT SERVICES. HPS agrees to outsource to SHPS, and hereby appoints SHPS as the exclusive provider of, Care Management Services to the Clients, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.",
      "reasoning": "The core economic substance is that HPS is outsourcing its Care Management Services to SHPS, and SHPS will provide those services to clients. The primary obligations are service provision (Care Management Services) by SHPS and payment/fee arrangements by HPS, matching an outsourcing arrangement.",

    "notice_period": {
      "raw_snippet": "Unless either party gives the other at least ninety days' prior written notice that it has elected not to extend the term of this Agreement beyond December 31, 1998, the term of this Agreement will be automatically extended until December 31, 1999. Thereafter this Agreement will automatically be renewed for successive additional periods of one year, unless either party gives notice of cancellation on or before October 1 of any such year.",
      "reasoning": "This paragraph contains the advance notice required to prevent automatic renewal. The initial prevention period is specified as \"at least ninety days' prior written notice\" to avoid extension beyond Dec 31, 1998. For subsequent years the contract requires notice of cancellation on or before a calendar deadline (October 1) to prevent the one-year automatic renewals.",
      "normalized_value": "90 days (to prevent initial extension); subsequent years: notice on or before October 1"

    "expiration_date": {
      "raw_snippet": "The term of this Agreement will commence on January 1, 1998 (the \"Effective Date\") and will end on December 31, 1998.",
      "reasoning": "This sentence explicitly states the effective date and the calendar date on which the initial term ends (December 31, 1998). Because a specific calendar date is given, the normalized value is returned as an ISO date.",
      "normalized_value": "1998-12-31"

Thereafter this Agreement will automatically be renewed for successive additional periods of one year, unless either party gives notice of cancellation on or before October 1 of any such year.",
      "reasoning": "The clause first provides an automatic extension to December 31, 1999 if not declined, and then specifies automatic renewal for successive one-year periods thereafter unless notice is given by the stated deadline. The economic effect is yearly automatic renewal after the initial extension.",
      "normalized_value": "1 year auto-renewal (after initial extension to 1999-12-31)"

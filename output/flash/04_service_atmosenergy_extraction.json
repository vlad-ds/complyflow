      "raw_snippet": "TRANSPORTATION SERVICE AGREEMENT",
      "reasoning": "The title of the agreement clearly indicates it is a 'TRANSPORTATION SERVICE AGREEMENT'. Article II further clarifies that 'Transporter agrees to transport' natural gas for 'Shipper'. This aligns with the 'Transportation Agreement' category.",

      "reasoning": "The contract states a primary term of ten years, after which it becomes month-to-month until terminated by notice (60 or 180 days depending on service type). This is a general termination notice for the month-to-month period, not a notice period required to prevent the automatic renewal of a fixed term, which is the specific definition for this field.

This Agreement shall terminate when the Termination Date has occurred for all Services.\nExhibit A: Many services, particularly in Section G1 (IT Services), Section G4.2 (Tax Services \u2013 Direct), Section G4.3 (Tax Services \u2013 Indirect), Section G4.5 (Tax Services \u2013 Audit Support), Section G8.1 (General Services \u2013 Legal Support), Section G8.4 (General Services \u2013 SEC Reporting and Compliance) specify a term of \"24 months from the Commencement Date.\"",

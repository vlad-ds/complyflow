      "reasoning": "While the contract mentions 'successive annual periods', its continuation is conditional upon specific annual approval by the Board of Trustees and Qualified Trustees. This is not a standard automatic renewal where the term rolls over unless terminated by notice; instead, it requires an active decision (approval) to continue.

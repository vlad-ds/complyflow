      "raw_snippet": "This Outsourcing Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is made and entered into as of January 1, 1998, by and between Sykes HealthPlan Services, Inc., a Florida corporation (\"SHPS\"), and HealthPlan Services, Inc., a Florida corporation (\"HPS\").",
      "reasoning": "The parties are identified in the introductory paragraph of the agreement as the entities entering into the contract, along with their defined abbreviations.",
      "normalized_value": [
        "Sykes HealthPlan Services, Inc.",
        "HealthPlan Services, Inc."

    "contract_type": {
      "raw_snippet": "OUTSOURCING AGREEMENT",
      "reasoning": "The document's title explicitly states 'Outsourcing Agreement', and the background and terms confirm HPS is outsourcing 'Care Management Services' to SHPS, which aligns with the definition of an outsourcing agreement.",
      "normalized_value": "Outsourcing Agreement"
    },
    "notice_period": {
      "raw_snippet": "Unless either party gives the other at least ninety days' prior written notice that it has elected not to extend the term of this Agreement beyond December 31, 1998, the term of this Agreement will be automatically extended until December 31, 1999. Thereafter this Agreement will automatically be renewed for successive additional periods of one year, unless either party gives notice of cancellation on or before October 1 of any such year.",
      "reasoning": "The contract specifies two notice periods for preventing renewal: 'at least ninety days' prior written notice' to prevent the first extension, and 'on or before October 1' to prevent subsequent annual renewals. Both effectively refer to a period around 90 days before the December 31st renewal date.",
      "normalized_value": "90 days"

    "expiration_date": {
      "raw_snippet": "The term of this Agreement will commence on January 1, 1998 (the \"Effective Date\") and will end on December 31, 1998.",

Thereafter this Agreement will automatically be renewed for successive additional periods of one year, unless either party gives notice of cancellation on or before October 1 of any such year.",
      "reasoning": "The contract first extends for one year, and then 'automatically be renewed for successive additional periods of one year'. This describes an auto-renewal mechanism for one-year terms.",
      "normalized_value": "1 year auto-renewal"

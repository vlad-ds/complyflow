As EU citizens live longer, the challenge of maintaining decent living standards in retirement has become more pressing. Citizens expect that after a lifetime of work, they will have access to a stable income that is sufficient to support a decent quality of life. Yet, the sustainability of pension systems and the adequacy of retirement income across the EU are under increasing strain as a result of demographic ageing and new forms of work. The EU\u2019s population is living longer, while the working-age population is shrinking. This structural shift implies that fewer workers will be available to finance the pensions of an increasing number of retirees, creating fiscal and social pressures that, if left unaddressed, could erode living standards and intergenerational fairness.\n\nThe EU must therefore act to help citizens secure their retirement income and preserve their standard of living in the face of unfavourable demographic developments, subdued productivity growth, and broader transformative challenges linked to climate change, digitalisation, and geopolitical uncertainty. The capacity to address the pension challenge effectively will shape the EU\u2019s economic resilience and social cohesion in the decades ahead.\n\nThe pension challenge is therefore central to EU\u2019s economic and social future. It concerns how a growing share of the population can maintain an adequate standard of living\u00a0after retirement, while ensuring that the burden on future generations remains sustainable. The European Pillar of Social Rights 1 , particularly Principle 15 on\u00a0\u201cOld age income and pensions\u201d, enshrines the right of workers and the self-employed to a pension that is commensurate with their contributions and ensures an adequate income, with equal opportunities for women and men to acquire pension rights.\n\nThe promise of an adequate and sustainable pension remains under pressure, despite numerous reforms at national level. Many Member States have reduced public pension replacement rates, increased the statutory pension age, or shifted from defined benefit to defined contribution schemes. Individuals are therefore increasingly expected to complement statutory pensions with occupational or personal savings. This places a \u201cdouble burden\u201d for the working-age population, who must finance current retirees, while also saving for their own retirement income.\n\nPeople need to be able to access safe, efficient, transparent and high-performing pension products in order to build up sufficient retirement savings. Reallocating household savings from low-yielding deposits to supplementary pension products that offer long-term investment opportunities can help individuals achieve a higher and more stable retirement income. At the same time, these savings, when channelled through well-governed and efficiently managed pension institutions, represent an important source of long-term capital for the European economy. The supplementary pension sector plays a double role: safeguarding individuals\u2019 financial security in retirement and contributing to EU\u2019s long-term economic sustainability.\n\nRecent high-level analyses have emphasised the importance of strengthening this channel between savings and investment. The reports by Mario Draghi 2 and Enrico Letta 3 highlighted that maintaining EU\u2019s living standards in the context of a shrinking workforce will require stronger productivity and increased\u00a0investment. The Draghi report, in particular, called for a more efficient mobilisation of household savings through long-term saving products such as occupational pensions, pointing to successful national examples that could inspire a broader EU approach.\n\nThere is a strong need to strengthen supplementary pensions as part of the EU\u2019s broader social contract. The European Council\u2019s\u00a0Conclusions of 17-18 April 2024 4 called for further work on developing pensions and long-term savings products, recognising their contribution to the green and digital transitions and to the growth of EU businesses. The European Council\u2019s Conclusions of 20 March 2025 5 reiterated the importance of increasing private capital participation to support investment and competitiveness, and invited the Commission to promote greater retail participation in capital markets, including through pension products.\n\nIn 2019, a High-Level Group of Experts on Pensions 6 that involved social partners\u00a0provided strategic advice on how supplementary pensions can contribute to the adequacy of old-age income and to the development of the EU pension market. The European Court of Auditors concluded in a 2024 report 7 that EU action had so far been limited in its effectiveness and called for more effort to strengthen occupational pensions as a complement to public schemes.\n\nThe design of pension systems remains under the competence of the Member States, but EU-level measures can support and complement national efforts to ensure adequate retirement income. The Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision (IORP) framework has provided the regulatory foundation for occupational pensions in the EU, establishing standards for prudential supervision, governance, and the protection of members and beneficiaries. While not all occupational pension vehicles fall under the IORP II Directive, members and beneficiaries in non-IORP schemes should be subject to sound governance and oversight and could benefit from being covered by the IORP II Directive.\n\nIn the Political Guidelines 2024\u20132029 8 , President von der Leyen announced the creation of a European Savings and Investments Union, designed to make EU savings work more effectively for long-term growth and prosperity. In its Communication of 19 March 2025 on the Savings and Investments Union, the Commission recognised the potential of the supplementary pension sector to contribute to this goal by mobilising private savings for productive investment and ensuring that the benefits of such investment are channelled back to citizens in the form of higher and reliable retirement incomes.\u00a0Furthermore, in the Mission Letter 9 addressed to the then Commissioner-designate for Financial Services and the Savings and Investments Union, President Von der Leyen emphasised the importance of harnessing the potential of private and occupational pensions to support EU citizens in securing their retirement and to facilitate the channelling of savings into the wider economy.\n\nThe Directive 2008/94/EC 10 on the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer\u00a0lays down that Member States are to ensure the protection of employees\u2019 pension entitlements in the event of the employer\u2019s insolvency.\n\nDirective 2003/41/EC 11 \u00a0on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision (the first IORP Directive) was introduced with the goal of creating a consistent prudential framework for occupational pension institutions within the internal market. Its primary objectives included enhancing the protection of members and beneficiaries, promoting sound governance and transparency, and addressing the fragmentation caused by varying national supervisory and regulatory regimes. By establishing minimum common standards and enabling cross-border management of occupational pension schemes, the IORP Directive aimed to create an internal market for occupational retirement provision. It encouraged the prudent and efficient investment of pension assets, thereby supporting the long-term sustainability of pension systems and the mobilisation of savings for productive investment within the EU\u2019s economy.\n\nDirective 2016/2341 12 \u00a0(the IORP II Directive), which recast and repealed\u00a0the first IORP Directive, was driven by the need to enhance the governance, transparency and cross-border operational effectiveness of occupational pension funds within the EU. Insights gained from implementing the first IORP Directive had highlighted significant variances in execution between different Member States and demonstrated inadequacies in the level of protection offered to members and beneficiaries. In response, the IORP II Directive set out more stringent prudential and governance standards, along with improved disclosure and transparency requirements, and included measures to facilitate cross-border pension scheme management. These enhancements were designed to ensure that occupational pensions remained secure, sustainable and efficient in the EU\u2019s increasingly mobile and integrated\u00a0labour market.\n\nThe ambition to revise the IORP II Directive responds to continuing economic, demographic and policy challenges, with a renewed focus on citizens\u2019 retirement security. It seeks to strengthen occupational pension funds\u2019 capacity to deliver adequate retirement income, to act as stable long-term investors supporting sustainable growth, and to contribute to the resilience and deepening of the EU\u2019s capital markets. The review of the IORP II Directive therefore aims to strengthen the framework for asset-backed pension provision and to foster better long-term investment outcomes for members and beneficiaries. It seeks to make IORPs more relevant and accessible for Member States where they are currently underdeveloped, while promoting stronger and more sustainable investment performance across the EU. It also aims to enhance transparency regarding both costs and returns, reinforce risk management practices and remove barriers that currently hinder efficient investment. The amended framework will thus support more efficient asset allocation and deliver greater value for members. In doing so, the proposed reform seeks to raise standards across the supplementary pensions landscape, fostering greater value, increased resilience and long-term security for members. It can help address persistent fragmentation, unlock more efficient and productive long-term investment, and ensure that a wider range of pension arrangements operate under sound governance and transparency standards. The amendment will also contribute to the objectives of the Savings and Investments Union by unlocking productive long-term investment, enhancing market integration and supporting sustainable growth within the EU.\n\n\u2022\nConsistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\nThe EU has implemented several key initiatives to strengthen the supplementary pension landscape:\n\n\u00b7\nDirective 98/49/EC of 29 June 1998 on safeguarding the supplementary pension rights of employed and self-employed persons moving within the EU 13 ;\n\n\u00b7\nDirective 2014/50/EU of 16 April 2014 on minimum requirements for enhancing worker mobility between Member States by improving the acquisition and preservation of supplementary pension rights 14 ;\n\n\u00b7\nDirective (EU) 2016/2341 of 14 December 2016 on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision (IORPs), known as IORP II, which strengthens governance, information disclosure, and cross-border requirements for occupational pension funds 15 ;\n\n\u00b7\nRegulation (EU) 2019/1238 of 20 June 2019 on a pan-European personal pension product (PEPP), establishing a voluntary, standardised personal pension framework across the EU 16 .\u00a0\n\nThis proposal builds on and strengthens the framework for IORPs set out in the IORP II Directive, as explained in more detail in section 3 below. It is part of a broader pension package that includes the review of Regulation (EU) 2019/1238 (the PEPP Regulation), the Commission Recommendations on Pension Dashboards, Pension Tracking Systems, and Auto-enrolment, as well as the Chapeau Communication on Supplementary Pensions Package. The pension package is one of the main deliverables under the Savings and Investments Union agenda. The proposed changes and recommendations have been drafted to ensure consistency across the various pieces of legislation and with the same general objective in mind.\n\n\u2022\nConsistency with other EU policies\n\nImplementing the Savings and Investments Union requires a comprehensive range of policy measures, affecting various dimensions of the EU\u2019s financial system. These policy measures can be grouped under four distinct but inter-related headings: (a) Citizens and Savings, (b) Investments and Financing, (c) Integration and Scale, and (d) Efficient Supervision in the Single Market. Each of these headings is discussed in the following sections.\n\nThe Pensions package falls under the \u2018Citizens and Savings\u2019 heading. By strengthening the framework for IORPs, the Commission contributes to the Savings and Investments Union objective of empowering citizens to save and invest for their future through transparent, competitive, and accessible products. Enhancing the IORP framework supports greater scale, consolidation and cross-border efficiencies in the supplementary pensions sector through enhanced supervisory scrutiny and a broader thematic review. By facilitating greater participation of pension savers in capital markets, the Pensions package also contributes to achieving the broader SIU objectives of mobilising household savings for productive investment; enhancing funding opportunities for the EU economy, also by attracting pension fund money into programmes such as InvestEU and helping financial institutions achieve scale, global competitiveness and diversification. It thus supports the EU\u2019s capacity to meet its long-term investment needs, notably in the context of the green and digital transitions.\n\nIORPs\u2019 development and growth can help channel more long-term capital into the EU\u2019s capital markets and, via these to the general economy \u2013 at a juncture where the EU\u2019s economy urgently needs to deploy investments to shore up its competitiveness. The review of the IORP\u00a0II Directive is therefore also in line with the Commission\u2019s broader strategy of rejuvenating the EU's economy, as outlined in the Competitiveness Compass 17 .\n\nThe review of the IORP II Directive is consistent with the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights (EPSR), specifically its Principle 15 which affirms the \"right to adequate old-age income\" and \"decent living standards\" for retirees. While the IORP II Directive is primarily a prudential and governance framework, its core aims\u2014strengthening the capacity of occupational funds to deliver adequate income, protecting the interests of members and beneficiaries, and improving transparency on both costs and return- are all essential for delivering sustainable and adequate supplementary pensions.\n\n2.\nLEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\u2022\nLegal basis\n\nThe legal bases for amending the IORP II Directive are Articles 53, 62 and 114(1) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Articles 53 and 62 provide for the coordination of national provisions governing the taking-up and pursuit of activities as self-employed persons and the freedom to provide services. These provisions enable the establishment and cross-border operation of IORPs within the internal market under consistent prudential, governance and supervisory standards. Article 114(1) allows the adoption of measures for the approximation of national provisions that have as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market.\n\nProviders\u2019 ability to use the freedom to provide services is still hampered by the lack of standardisation of existing occupational pension products. The proposal therefore aims to improve key elements of the framework for IORPs to create a more coherent model. This will empower their members and beneficiaries to make full use of the internal market, offering them a greater choice of providers, including in other EU Member States. The proposal harmonises the core features of IORPs: enhanced transparency regarding both costs and returns, risk management practices and efficient investment policies.\n\n\u2022\nSubsidiarity\n\nAccording to the subsidiarity principle, EU action may only be taken if the envisaged aims cannot be achieved by Member States alone. The IORP II Directive has been established at EU level since 2019 because only EU action can set a common regulatory framework for IORPs. In this regard, this proposal, like the IORP II Directive it seeks to amend, is in full compliance with the subsidiarity principle.\n\n\u2022\nProportionality\n\nUnder the proportionality principle, the content and form of EU action should not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties.\n\nIORPs can in principle already be established in all Member States, but they have not realised their full potential in terms of channelling enough savings towards capital markets and contributing to the Savings and Investments Union. This is particularly relevant given the demographic pressures and the increasing need to ensure sustainable and adequate retirement income.\n\nThe framework established by the IORP II Directive has not achieved sufficient scale which is a key condition for improving long-term outcomes for members and beneficiaries. The staff working document accompanying this proposal therefore examined several policy options.\n\nThe \u2018no EU action\u2019 scenario would fail to meet the EU\u2019s objectives. However, a full harmonisation of national occupational pension regimes would be disproportionate, given the diversity of national markets and the varying levels of development of pension systems.\n\nIn this context, a targeted revision of the IORP framework is a proportionate response. The proposed approach complements existing national regimes, but also ensures a sufficient level of harmonisation to facilitate scale and enhance investment outcomes. The key features \u2013 enhanced transparency of costs and returns, reinforced robust risk management practices, and removal of barriers that presently hinder efficient investment \u2013 have been designed to ensure sufficient consumer protection without imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens.\n\nThe administrative burden of the proposal is expected to remain limited because it merely adjusts the features of existing EU-wide rules for IORPs. These entities are already subject to regulatory oversight by national competent authorities (NCAs) under existing sectoral frameworks. Any new reporting obligations would be proportionate to the risks of a rising cross-border activity and would support effective market monitoring and consumer protection. Overall, the proposal would streamline existing practices across the EU.\n\n\u2022\nChoice of the instrument\n\nThise proposal is an amendment to the IORP II Directive. The instrument chosen is therefore an amending Directive because no alternative means \u2013 legislative or operational \u2013 can be used to attain the objectives of this proposal.\n\n3.\nRESULTS OF-EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\u2022\nStakeholder consultations\n\nThe Commission launched a targeted public consultation from 13 June 2025 until 29 August 2025, seeking feedback on possible revisions to the IORP II Directive. The consultation received a total of 112 submissions from a diverse group of stakeholders, including business associations, companies, consumer organisations, NGOs, public authorities, and citizens, representing 11 EU Member States and two non-EU countries. Stakeholders indicated that investment flexibility and diversification would, along with strong governance and greater transparency, improve the current framework.\n\nThe Commission launched a Call for Evidence on 23 June 2025, with a deadline of 21 July 2025, to collect general comments, opinions, and views on improving the existing framework for supplementary pensions and to share evidence on best practices. The Call received a total of 47 submissions, amounting to 35 unique responses, from various organisations, such as business and employer associations, NGOs, consumer organisations, and citizens, from 12 EU Member States and four non-EU countries. Overall, the vast majority of respondents agreed that improvements to supplementary pensions are necessary in order to unlock their full potential to benefit of EU's citizens and economy.\n\n\u2022\nCollection and use of expertise\n\nOn 28 September 2023, EIOPA provided technical advice for the review of the IORP II Directive 18 . It recommended\u00a0(i) updating the IORP regulatory framework to address the shift from defined benefit to defined contribution pensions and socio-environmental challenges; (ii) enhancing cost transparency, sustainability in investments and proper regulation of defined benefit schemes; and (iii) improving proportionality measures.\n\nOn 16 June 2025, the Commission hosted a stakeholder forum 19 to explore emerging trends in retirement provision across the EU. This forum highlighted best practices from Member States and paved the way for sharing successful strategies across the EU. The reality check showcased success stories on second and third pillar pensions and explored how best practices can be used as guideposts for further reforms. Discussions obtained feedback from all stakeholders active in providing retirement products. The participants agreed that a review of the IORP II Directive was necessary to improve outcomes for retirees.\n\nEIOPA submitted technical input 20 requested by the Commission to support the development of supplementary pensions on 5 September 2025\u00a0and enhance the supplementary pension system. EIOPA advocated (i) stronger supervision, (ii) the\u00a0use of a more risk-based approach to foster investment opportunities in alternative assets, and (iii) clarification of the scope of the IORP II Directive in order to further unlock the benefits of long-term savings.\u00a0\n\n\u2022\nImpact assessment\n\nThe proposal is supported by a Staff Working Document that assessed the impact of the proposed amendments.\n\nThe Staff Working Document examines four options for the proposed amending Directive:\n\nOption 1 would maintain the current framework of the IORP II Directive unamended and rely on slow, organic growth to deliver scale and improvements over time. This option was discarded because of the need to strengthen EU citizens\u2019 supplementary pensions act as described above.\n\nOption 2 would clarify the prudent person principle. This clarification would promote a shift in the focus of IORPs\u2019 investment policies away from simplistic conservative asset allocations neglecting the return-leg of pension funds objectives toward more balanced risk-return investment strategies that (i) pursue long-term value for pension scheme members by diversifying risks, including across asset classes, and (ii) are guided by sound governance, and the knowledge and ability to manage the risks undertaken. It should be stressed that achieving adequate scale enhances the ability of IORPs to diversify effectively, manage risks holistically, and access a broader set of investment opportunities, while also maintaining sound governance and risk management standards.\n\nOption 3 would amend the IORP II Directive to strengthen supervisory oversight, governance standards and transparency, while relying primarily on supervisory dialogue and moral suasion to encourage improvements in scale, efficiency and scheme quality. Under this approach, NCAs use supervisory measures and would carry out regular thematic reviews of key performance areas such as investment results, cost efficiency, indexation fulfilment, and any curtailment of benefits. These reviews would also assess the alignment of investment strategies with pension fund obligations and the competence of trustees or boards overseeing the schemes. Once plans to remedy shortcomings have to be agreed and acted upon, that process could \u2013 where necessary \u2013 include consideration of potential means to scale up. Transfer rules would be simplified in order to make the IORP II framework more accessible, particularly in Member States where the occupational pension sector remains underdeveloped.\n\nBeyond moral suasion, this option would implement the main elements of EIOPA\u2019s technical recommendations with the aim of progressively improving investment practices, transparency and governance across supplementary pension schemes. The focus would be on strengthening risk management frameworks, improving disclosure of costs and returns, and supporting more sustainable and balanced investment strategies. The reform would also seek to address structural barriers that limit efficiency and scale, such as fragmentation, limited cooperation between schemes, and uneven supervisory capacity. These measures would not radically transform the system in the short term, but they would gradually improve the performance, sustainability and efficiency of IORPs. Over time, the framework would support more effective cross-border operation, better investment outcomes and a higher level of protection for members and beneficiaries.\n\nOption 4\u00a0would retain all the elements of Option 3, including thematic reviews, nudges, improved supervisory practices, and the implementation of most of EIOPA\u2019s recommendations. However, it would go further by introducing binding regulatory requirements and specific supervisory interventions to address persistent structural inefficiencies. One key measure would be the establishment of a mandatory minimum efficient scale for IORPs. This could include providing templates for winding up or merging schemes in cases where the minimum efficiency scale and performance are not achieved. It could also involve the mandatory appointment of scheme trustees if existing vacancies are not promptly filled or if current officeholders lack the necessary skills required for effectively managing an investment portfolio strategy. However, this approach places significant demands on supervisory capacities\u00a0and may expose supervisors to liability risks if pension providers seek\u00a0judicial review.\u00a0In addition, the establishment of a mandatory minimum efficient scale for IORPs would require significant time and resources, while the optimal scale could still vary from one IORP to another.\u00a0Such a measure would also\u00a0run counter to\u00a0a market-driven approach by mandating \u2018top-down\u2019 consolidation that is not compatible with current IORP governance structures 21 .\u00a0\n\nOption 3 is the selected option.\n\n\u2022\nFundamental rights\n\nThe proposal respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the right to the protection of personal data, the right to property, the freedom to conduct a business and the principle of equality between men and women. It contributes to the objectives of Article 38 of the Charter which provides for a high level of consumer protection.\n\n4.\nBUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe proposal has no material implications for the EU\u2019s budget. EIOPA should be able to accommodate the additional coordination and supervisory convergence tasks, including the establishment of collaboration platforms, within its existing resources.\n\n5.\nOTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\u2022\nImplementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\nThe Member States would be required to transpose the Directive within one year of the date of entry into force of the amendments to the IORP II Directive. The Member States would then communicate texts of the main adopted provisions of national law to the Commission.\n\n\u2022\nExplanatory documents\n\nThe proposed Directive would make specific amendments to an existing Directive. Member States should therefore either communicate to the Commission the text of the corresponding amendments to their national provisions or, if they consider that no such amendments are necessary, explain which specific provisions of national law already implement the amendments set out in the proposal.\n\n\u2022\nDetailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\nArticle 1 of the proposal amends Directive (EU) 2016/2341. The specific provisions that are amended are the following:\n\n\u2013\nArticle 4 allows Member States to apply Directive (EU) 2016/2341 to funded institutions providing retirement benefits that are not otherwise covered by Union prudential legislation.\n\n\u2013\nArticle 9 requires that IORPs undergo an authorisation procedure by the competent authority, which shall include a prudential assessment and the preparation of a business plan.\n\n\u2013\nArticle 9a\u00a0ensures that IORPs are allowed to operate different pension schemes, including those with different investment policies, and to accept sponsorship from multiple sponsoring undertakings within the same pension scheme.\n\n\u2013\nArticles 11 and 11a streamline the cross-border procedures for IORPs by introducing clearer timelines, improved coordination between competent authorities, as well as a simplified notification process for extending existing cross-border activities within the same host Member State.\n\n\u2013\nArticle 12 simplifies the rules governing transfers of pension schemes, reducing undue obstacles to consolidation and scale while ensuring adequate protection of members and beneficiaries.\n\n\u2013\nArticle 14 provides that competent authorities shall have the power to allow underfunding for a limited period, determined under national law, which in any case should not exceed ten years, and removes additional requirements for cross-border IORPs.\n\n\u2013\nArticle 17 empowers the Commission to adopt a delegated act to amend the numbers and percentage values of the required solvency margin\u00a0in order to adapt to market developments.\n\n\u2013\nArticle 18a\u00a0requires IORPs which are not subject to risk-based regulatory own funds requirements and which underwrite biometric risks or provide guarantees to carry out a stress test at least every three years, assessing their capacity to meet obligations under adverse market and demographic scenarios. Competent authorities may require more frequent testing where vulnerabilities are identified. The provision specifies standard stress scenarios and allows Member States to impose longer projection horizons or more severe assumptions. The article also provides that where stress test results indicate insufficient assets or available solvency margins, IORPs shall submit a convergence plan outlining corrective measures. Ultimately, competent authorities may require higher solvency margins if the plan is not credible or not submitted.\n\n\u2013\nArticle 19 introduces a more principles-based prudent person principle and restricts the ability to set out more detailed rules to schemes where members and beneficiaries bear the investment risk, with no possibility to restrict the types of assets in which an IORP may invest.\u00a0This does not impinge on the possibility of competent authorities to require restrictions where risks are borne by the members and beneficiaries and as long as such restrictions do not amount to blank prohibitions.\n\n\u2013\nArticle 21 provides that the system of governance must comprise an effective mechanism for managing conflicts of interest and include a compliance function.\n\n\u2013\nArticle 22 strengthens the fit and proper requirements. The qualifications, knowledge and experience of the members of the administrative, management or supervisory body shall continue to be collectively sufficient to enable them to perform their duties effectively. By contrast, the requirements are reinforced for the persons who effectively run the IORP, who shall individually meet the required standards of fitness and propriety.\n\n\u2013\nArticle 26 provides that the findings and recommendations of the internal audit shall be reported to the administrative, management or supervisory body, which shall determine the appropriate actions to be taken in respect of each finding and recommendation and shall ensure their effective implementation.\n\n\u2013\nArticle 28 ensures that IORPs establish a written policy for own-risk assessment containing the processes and procedures for carrying out the assessment, the frequency of the assessment and the methods.\n\n\u2013\nArticle 30 requires that the statement of investment policy principles clearly set out investment objectives consistent with each scheme\u2019s retirement income goals and define tolerances for deviations from the asset allocation and performance objectives, in line with the OECD Core Principles of Private Pension Regulation and its Implementing Guidelines.\n\n\u2013\nArticle 33 ensures that, in the case of a pension scheme where members and beneficiaries fully bear the investment risk, safe-keeping of assets and oversight duties are reinforced.\n\n\u2013\nArticles 36 to 44 reinforce the information to members and beneficiaries during the accumulation and decumulation phases.\u00a0In particular, Article 37a requires IORPs to share relevant information with pension tracking systems to enhance transparency and facilitate member and beneficiaries\u2019\u00a0awareness of their entitlements.\n\n\u2013\nArticle 44a introduces an explicit duty of care for IORPs, requiring them to act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of members and beneficiaries.\n\n\u2013\nArticles 44c and 44d require IORPs to establish effective complaints-handling procedures and Member States to ensure the availability of adequate, independent and impartial dispute resolution bodies, including for cross-border cases.\n\n\u2013\nArticles 45 to 51 strengthen supervision and enhance the powers of competent authorities. In particular, Article 49a introduces a regular supervisory dialogue aimed at encouraging strategic reflection on the long-term adequacy, efficiency and sustainability of the IORP.\n\n\u2013\nArticles 6, 7, 13, 16, 36, 47, 50 and 51 recognise that in some Member States, IORPs are allowed to provide personal pension products, including the pan-European Personal Pension Product (PEPP), and ensure that the prudential framework reflects this possibility to promote coherence, sound organisation and effective supervision across all forms of retirement provision.\n\n\u2013\nArticles 19, 21, 23 to 26, 28, 47 and 49\u00a0are amended\u00a0so that references to \u2018size, nature, scale and complexity\u2019 are replaced\u00a0by \u2018nature, scale and complexity\u2019, as \u2018size\u2019 is not an appropriate criterion for IORPs, whose prudential and governance requirements should reflect their risk profile rather than their absolute size, in line with the principle of risk-based supervision.\n\nOther provisions are modified for updates and fixes.\n\nArticle 2 of the proposal amends Directive (EU) 2016/97. It ensures that members and beneficiaries of occupational pension arrangements operated by insurance undertakings have, at least, access to the same information as members and beneficiaries as in the case of arrangements operated by IORPs, and that insurance undertakings and insurance intermediaries have an appropriate legal basis to share information with pension tracking systems.\n\nArticle 3 of the proposal introduces grandfathering arrangements, so that IORPs registered or authorised under Directive (EU) 2016/2341 prior to the change in authorisation rules do not need to seek a new authorisation.\n\n2025/0362 (COD)\n\nProposal for a\n\nDIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\namending Directives (EU) 2016/2341 and 2016/97 as regards the strengthening of the framework for occupational retirement provision\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article\u00a053, Article 62 and Article 114(1) thereof,\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 22 ,\n\nAfter consulting the European Data Protection Supervisor,\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 23 ,\n\nWhereas:\n\n(1)\nIn view of the ageing population of the European Union and the rising dependency ratio, strengthening complementary sources of retirement income has become indispensable to preserve intergenerational solidarity, social cohesion and the long-term stability of pension systems across the Union.\n\n(2)\nWhile the organisation of pension systems remains a national competence, the adequacy and financial sustainability of pensions are of common concern for the stability and cohesion of the Union. Ensuring that citizens have access to well-designed personal pension products contributes both to individual financial security and to the resilience of the Union\u2019s economy.\n\n(3)\nDespite being among the world\u2019s highest savers, Union households still hold a large share of their financial wealth in short-term bank deposits with limited returns. Developing attractive occupational and personal pension products can help mobilise those savings for long-term investment, generating higher returns for savers and channelling capital towards productive uses that support growth, innovation and the green and digital transitions.\n\n(4)\nAppropriate regulation and supervision at Union and national level remain important for the development of safe and secure occupational retirement provision across all Member States.\u00a0Directive (EU) 2016/2341\u00a0of the European Parliament and of the Council 24 \u00a0has contributed to a more harmonised prudential framework for institutions for occupational retirement provision (IORPs). However, the supplementary pension sector remains underdeveloped in many Member States, which could jeopardise the financial security of citizens, in particular in light of ongoing demographic trends within the Union. As part of strong multi-pillar pension systems, developed in dialogue with social partners, it is essential to support the further uptake of supplementary pensions such as IORPs and to help deliver better outcomes for long-term savers. This requires policy action both at national and at Union level.\n\n(5)\nThe Savings and Investments Union (SIU) announced by the Commission in its Communication of 19 March 2015 25 \u00a0aims to enable\u00a0citizens\u00a0to save and invest for their future, channel investments towards the\u00a0priorities of the Union, deepen integration and scale in the Union\u2019s capital markets, and ensure effective supervision across the single market. Among those four strands, helping citizens save and invest for their future is at the heart of the SIU\u2019s ambition. Ensuring that Union citizens\u00a0can build adequate retirement income is one of the most concrete ways in which the Union can make a difference in people\u2019s lives. The work on supplementary pensions, and in particular on occupational pensions, embodies this citizen-centred approach.\n\n(6)\nWith approximately\u00a0three\u00a0trillion euros in assets under management, institutions for occupational retirement provision (\u2018IORPs\u2019) play an essential role in the Union\u2019s financial system but tend to be less active in listed equity, private equity, venture capital and infrastructure markets. Provided that investments in equity and alternative asset classes are prudently managed, such investments can be a valuable component of their portfolios, offering diversification, higher long-term returns for pension savers and protection against inflation, while also providing crucial funding for the real economy. It is therefore important to ensure that there are no undue regulatory barriers to such investments.\n\n(7)\nThe review of\u00a0Directive (EU) 2016/2341\u00a0builds on the\u00a0European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA)\u2019s 2023 technical advice for the review of the IORP II Directive 26 \u00a0and its 2025 \u2018technical input on the review of the IORP II Directive and the PEPP Regulation in the context of the Savings and Investments Union\u2019 27 . It also takes into account recent findings and recommendations from the Special Report 14/2025 of the European Court of Auditors concerning the development of supplementary pensions in the Union 28 , as well as the OECD Core Principles of Private Pension Regulation 29 , which set out internationally recognised standards for the governance, transparency and supervision of occupational pensions.\n\n(8)\nAchieving sufficient scale is often a prerequisite for the efficient and sustainable functioning of IORPs. Smaller IORPs may face higher administrative and investment costs, limited diversification, and difficulties in attracting or retaining the necessary professional expertise. Greater scale can help mitigate those constraints by improving risk pooling, governance capacity, and access to a broader range of investment opportunities, thereby contributing to more stable and cost-effective outcomes for members and beneficiaries.\u00a0\n\n(9)\nDirective (EU) 2016/2341, however, has not been sufficiently effective in fostering economies of scale, resulting in pension providers that are often too small to benefit from diversification or efficiency gains, and therefore expose members and beneficiaries to higher costs and lower net returns.\u00a0It is therefore necessary to facilitate such economies of scale.\n\n(10)\nDirective (EU) 2016/2341 should apply\u00a0to all IORPs, unless they are expressly excluded pursuant to Article 2(2). Its application should reflect the objectives pursued by that Directive and the diversity of arrangements within Member States, and should be implemented in a manner that recognises the full spectrum of existing occupational pension provision.\n\n(11)\nIn some Member States, national law provides that IORPs, despite having legal personality, are to be operated by authorised entities responsible for acting on their behalf. It is therefore appropriate that Article 2(1)\u00a0of Directive (EU) 2016/2341\u00a0refers explicitly not only to situations where IORPs do not have legal personality, which should continue to be covered, but also to those cases where IORPs have legal personality yet, in accordance with national law, are to be operated by such authorised entities.\u00a0\n\n(12)\nIn certain Member States, responsibility for the operation of an IORP may be shared between the IORP itself and the authorised entity acting on its behalf, each performing distinct but complementary functions. The application of Directive (EU) 2016/2341 should be coherent with that allocation of responsibilities under national law and ensure that all those responsible are fully subject to its requirements, irrespective of the legal form of the IORP. This situation should however be distinguished from outsourcing as referred to in Article 31 of that Directive, since the shared exercise of responsibilities in these instances\u00a0stems from the institutional structure of the IORP as defined under national law and not from a contractual outsourcing of functions.\u00a0Member States should also ensure that the assets of IORPs are legally separate from those of the authorised entities operating them.\u00a0\n\n(13)\nThe determination of whether an institution qualifies as an IORP should depend on the activities carried out, irrespective of its legal form or designation under national law. In several Member States, employment-related retirement provision is provided\u00a0by funded institutions which are excluded from the\u00a0scope of Directive (EU) 2016/2341\u00a0pursuant\u00a0to\u00a0its Article 2(2), or are otherwise not covered by that Directive without being subject to any other Union prudential legislation. Some of those institutions are already covered by Regulation (EU) 2018/231\u00a0of the European Central Bank 30 \u00a0on statistical reporting requirements for pension funds, reflecting their economic\u00a0importance\u00a0and the need for comprehensive and consistent information across all types of pension institutions.\u00a0Taken together, such institutions excluded from the scope of Directive (EU) 2016/2341 hold very\u00a0substantial assets and constitute an important component of the overall employment-related retirement landscape alongside IORPs.\u00a0In view of their scale and their relevance for financial stability and pension adequacy, it is important for Member States to ensure that all institutions\u00a0managing retirement savings, whether occupational or personal, are subject to sound governance, effective supervision and prudential requirements commensurate with the nature and magnitude of the risks they bear. In light of the solid framework provided by Directive (EU) 2016/2341\u00a0and to promote consistency in supervisory practices, ensure a level playing field and high standards of governance and risk management across all forms of retirement provision, while respecting the diversity of national pension systems and existing institutional arrangements,\u00a0Member States should have the option to apply that Directive to institutions otherwise excluded from its scope\u00a0and not covered by any other Union prudential framework. This is particularly relevant\u00a0where the level of benefits offered to members and beneficiaries depends on the performance\u00a0of the institution in managing assets and is not guaranteed by a public authority.\u00a0Member States should notify the Commission and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority of their use of this option.\n\n(14)\nIn\u00a0some Member States, IORPs may also be\u00a0allowed to provide personal pension products, including the pan-European Personal Pension Product, as reflected in Regulation (EU) 2019/1238\u00a0of the European Parliament and of the Council 31 . To ensure a clear and sound organisation of such activities, and coherent and effective supervision across different forms of retirement provision, it is therefore appropriate to reflect this within Directive (EU) 2016/2341.\n\n(15)\nThe organisation of occupational retirement provision may benefit from greater flexibility in how IORPs structure and manage pension schemes and sponsorship arrangements. Therefore, Member States should ensure that IORPs are allowed to operate different pension schemes, including those with distinct investment policies, and to accept sponsorship from multiple sponsoring undertakings, including within the same pension scheme. That flexibility can facilitate the achievement of greater scale, thereby enhancing cost efficiency, risk diversification and governance capacity, to the benefit of members and beneficiaries.\n\n(16)\nDirective (EU) 2016/2341 distinguishes between the authorisation and registration of IORPs but does not define either concept, while requiring Member States to maintain a national register of IORPs. This has resulted in divergent supervisory practices, including cases where competent authorities do not conduct an ex\u00a0ante prudential assessment, or, in certain cases, where no prudential\u00a0assessment is carried out at all. The absence of a prudential assessment as part of the registration or authorisation process may undermine the proper functioning of the internal market and the protection of the rights of members and beneficiaries. To avoid regulatory arbitrage and safeguard the interests of pension savers, all IORPs should be subject to an authorisation procedure that includes an appropriate prudential assessment by the competent authority. In line with EIOPA\u2019s technical advice on the review of the IORP\u00a0II Directive and with the Implementing Guidelines of the OECD Recommendation on Core Principles of Private Pension Regulation, the authorisation process should also require IORPs to establish and maintain a business plan for all planned activities.\n\n(17)\nTo enhance effective and adaptable occupational retirement provision,\u00a0as well as economies of scale, IORPs should be allowed to operate several pension schemes, including those with distinct investment approaches, and to accept sponsorship from several undertakings within the same scheme, while ensuring proper management and the protection of members and beneficiaries.\n\n(18)\nExperience with the functioning of Directive (EU) 2016/2341 has shown that the procedures governing the authorisation and supervision of IORPs, in particular in the context of cross-border activities, can give rise to delays and inconsistencies across Member States, which may discourage IORPs from engaging in or expanding their cross-border activities.\u00a0To improve the functioning and supervision of cross-border activities of IORPs, the procedural steps for authorisation and cross-border activities should therefore be elaborated and streamlined.\u00a0The timelines should be made clearer and exchanges of information between home and host competent authorities should be made faster, allowing closer coordination including, where appropriate, through the involvement of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (\u2018EIOPA\u2019).\n\n(19)\nIt is unnecessarily burdensome to impose on an IORP that\u00a0is carrying out cross-border activities in a host Member State full initial cross-border procedures where such IORP wishes to extend those activities to additional sponsoring undertakings or schemes in the same host Member State. Such an approach could lead to duplication of procedures, increased administrative costs and delays, without improving the protection of members and beneficiaries. To facilitate proportionate and efficient supervision and ensure effective cooperation between the competent authorities of the home and host Member States, such extensions should be made subject to a simplified notification procedure to be completed within one month. That timeline\u00a0ensures that competent authorities can carry out the necessary coordination and oversight without creating undue delays or burdens for IORPs.\n\n(20)\nThe rules governing\u00a0collective transfers of all or part of a pension scheme\u2019s liabilities, technical provisions, and other obligations and rights play\u00a0a key role in supporting consolidation and the achievement of scale in occupational retirement provision. Where such rules are overly strict, they create undue obstacles to achieving scale and facilitating consolidation, which can be detrimental to the long-term interests of savers. At the same time, it is important that members and beneficiaries, or their representatives, can effectively express their views on proposed cross-border transfers. To facilitate such transfers, it is therefore appropriate to clarify and simplify the applicable Union rules, ensuring that procedures remain transparent, proportionate and consistent with the protection of members and beneficiaries, while enabling greater efficiency and integration in the internal market.\u00a0This should include provisions for timely notification, approval by the sponsoring undertaking where applicable, and the possibility for members and beneficiaries to formally express opposition.\n\n(21)\nFor domestic collective transfers from one IORP to another, Member States should ensure that simple, transparent and operationally efficient procedures are in place to enable consolidation and restructuring of pension schemes within their territories. Such procedures should facilitate the attainment of scale and cost efficiency\u00a0and should not be more restrictive than the procedures applicable to cross-border transfers.\n\n(22)\nMember States have the option to allow temporary underfunding of occupational pension schemes. Different Member States have implemented that\u00a0option in varying ways, while others have chosen not to use it, resulting in inconsistencies that may affect the protection of members and beneficiaries. While preventing underfunding is important, an absolute prohibition could, in some cases, force abrupt reductions in pension promises, which may be detrimental to members and beneficiaries. To ensure a balanced and proportionate approach and an adequate protection of members and beneficiaries, Member States should allow temporary underfunding for a limited period, determined by national law, which in any case should not exceed ten years.\n\n(23)\nCertain technical parameters in Directive (EU) 2016/2341 stem from Council Directive 79/267/EEC 32 , the first Life Insurance Directive, and have remained unchanged since their introduction. It is therefore appropriate to provide for the possibility of their adjustment through delegated acts, should this be considered necessary to ensure that they remain appropriate in light of market developments and supervisory practices.\n\n(24)\nDirective (EU) 2016/2341 requires IORPs to hold an adequate available solvency margin. That solvency margin does not fully capture exposures to market and longevity risks, including where the IORP underwrites biometric risk or guarantees a given investment performance or level of benefits. Some Member States require IORPs to hold additional risk-based regulatory own funds above the required solvency margin. In Member States where such risk-based requirements do not exist, comparable protection for savers and beneficiaries should be ensured. In particular, IORPs covering biometric risk or offering guarantees and which are not subject to risk-based capital requirements, should carry out regular stress tests to assess their ability to remain funded over a long-term horizon, including under adverse market and demographic scenarios, and competent\u00a0authorities should have the power\u00a0to require remedial actions where an underfunding is identified.\n\n(25)\nPrivate assets, including private equity, private debt and venture capital, can improve the risk-return characteristics of investment portfolios by enhancing diversification and potentially delivering higher long-term returns. However, such assets are often more complex to value and to assess in terms of risk, hence requiring substantial professional expertise. Pursuant to Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2016/2341, IORPs should invest in the best long-term interests of members and beneficiaries and in accordance with the prudent person rule. That rule, however, is not sufficiently specified, and several Member States have introduced, in line with that Article, detailed and sometimes restrictive investment limits. Such across-the-board constraints may prevent well-governed institutions with adequate risk-management capacity from investing efficiently in alternative assets. It should therefore be laid down that the key investment framework is a risk-based prudent person principle, allowing institutions to invest in any type of asset, provided that they can properly identify, measure, monitor, manage and report the associated risks. Accordingly, as a safeguard for members and beneficiaries, the possibility for Member States to apply investment restrictions should be limited to cases where the investment risk is borne by members and beneficiaries, and, those restrictions should not result in a blanket prohibition on investing in certain asset classes.The chapeau communication of 19 November 2025 33 \u00a0provides further non-binding guidance on the application of the prudent person principle, including on how it should support the efficient allocation of long-term savings.\n\n(26)\nExperience has shown that the governance requirements set out in Directive (EU) 2016/2341 do not always ensure consistent standards of sound management and effective oversight across IORPs. In particular, differences in internal control functions, the handling of conflicts of interest, and the composition and effectiveness of administrative, management or supervisory bodies may weaken the protection of members and beneficiaries and the integrity of pension scheme management. To enhance the resilience, transparency and accountability of IORPs, the system of governance should therefore be further specified, and competent authorities should be equipped with the powers\u00a0necessary to assess and, where appropriate, strengthen IORPs\u2019 governance systems.\n\n(27)\nThe effective and prudent management of an IORP depends on the fitness and propriety of the persons who effectively run the IORP, its administrative, management or supervisory bodies, and key function holders, including those to whom functions have been outsourced. Directive (EU) 2016/2341 refers to the concept of collective fitness for those who effectively run the IORP. Further clarification is needed to ensure that this concept is applied in a manner consistent with the diversity of governance structures across Member States.\u00a0In particular, collective fitness should apply where the administrative, management or supervisory body operates as a collegiate body whose members jointly perform strategic or oversight functions. Where functions are distinct or exercised individually, the assessment of fitness should relate to each person\u2019s specific role, responsibilities and decision-making powers.\u00a0Furthermore, the current provisions do not\u00a0explicitly provide for ongoing monitoring or timely notification of changes, which may also result in gaps in governance, insufficient oversight of risks, or unaddressed conflicts of interest. To ensure adequate protection of members and beneficiaries and effective supervision by competent authorities, the requirements for fitness and propriety should be laid down, competent authorities should be given the responsibility to assess suitability on an ongoing basis, and they should have the power to require the removal of individuals who no longer meet those requirements.\n\n(28)\nEffective risk management is essential to ensure the sound and prudent operation of IORPs and to protect members and beneficiaries. Operational and structural choices of IORPs, including participation in pooled investment structures, shared services, or transfers, can affect their overall risk profile. To ensure sound and prudent management, IORPs should assess the risks they are or could be exposed to against the risk tolerance limits approved by their management or supervisory body, taking into account the capacity and appetite for risk of members and beneficiaries. Economies of scale and efficiency options can reduce operational and investment risks for members and beneficiaries and should therefore be considered in the own-risk assessment.\n\n(29)\nIn line with the OECD Core Principles of Private Pension Regulation and their Implementing Guidelines,\u00a0it is appropriate to further strengthen the requirements of the statement of investment policy principles by ensuring that it sets out clear investment objectives consistent with each scheme\u2019s retirement income goal, liabilities and risk tolerance, defines performance objectives and monitoring methods, and addresses the use of complex or alternative asset classes and related counterparty risk. Where members may choose investments, the statement should also provide for an appropriate range of options, including a default one.\n\n(30)\nThe pooling of assets can deliver economies of scale, improve investment performance and reduce costs for members and beneficiaries. However, Article 31 of Directive (EU) 2016/2341 allows Member States to prohibit the outsourcing of activities by IORPs, including the outsourcing of investment management. The use of that\u00a0option has resulted in regulatory barriers to efficiency gains and economies of scale. A more risk-based approach would ensure that outsourcing is generally permitted or required, provided that it does not impair the quality of governance, unduly increase operational risk, undermine the continuous and satisfactory service to members and beneficiaries, or hinder effective supervisory oversight. It should therefore be laid down that that Member States should allow, or where appropriate require, outsourcing by such institutions, without prejudice to opposing specific outsourcing arrangements on a case-by-case basis on duly justified prudential grounds.\n\n(31)\nDepositaries provide a convenient remedy for\u00a0safeguarding assets and overseeing the management of occupational pension schemes, particularly in defined contribution schemes where members and beneficiaries fully bear the investment risk. Under Directive (EU) 2016/2341, Member States have discretion to require, as a general rule, a depositary or to allow IORPs to perform these functions themselves. That\u00a0discretion has led to inconsistencies and supervisory challenges in cross-border activities. Differences in national rules on the types of entities that may act as depositaries and the scope of their responsibilities may undermine effective prudential oversight, reduce transparency, and increase the risk of conflicts of interest or operational failures. In recent years, the rules on depositaries laid down in Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 34 \u00a0have been updated and strengthened to ensure a high level of investor protection. Members and beneficiaries of IORPs, who similarly entrust their retirement savings to professional managers, should benefit from no less protection than investors covered by Directive 2009/65/EC.\u00a0Therefore, to ensure consistent protection of members and beneficiaries, enhance trust in the pension system, and facilitate cross-border activities, Directive (EU) 2016/2341 should require the appointment of a professional depositary for\u00a0occupational pension schemes where members and beneficiaries fully bear the investment risk. The amendments should set out clear rules for such depository on the safekeeping of assets and oversight duties for depositaries, while allowing greater\u00a0flexibility for other schemes and ensuring that competent authorities may not unduly restrict the choice of depositaries established in another Member State.\u00a0However, to avoid unnecessary burden for IORPs, Member States may maintain existing safe-keeping measures providing a level of protection comparable with depositaries.\n\n(32)\nFragmented and incomplete information on accrued and projected pension entitlements makes it difficult for members and beneficiaries to obtain a clear overview of their future retirement income, particularly when they participate in several supplementary pension schemes. That\u00a0lack of transparency can undermine engagement with retirement planning and trust in the pension system. To ensure that savers receive comprehensive, reliable and up-to-date information, Member States should require IORPs to provide data to national pension tracking systems, where such systems exist, in a standardised and interoperable format. Such systems should allow members and beneficiaries to access, in a coherent and comparable manner, information on their accrued rights, accumulated capital and projected benefits, while ensuring that IORPs remain responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data transmitted.\u00a0To avoid duplication of reporting requirements for IORPs, the format and structure of information should be consistent with the information included in the pension benefit statements.\n\n(33)\nThe Pension Benefit Statement (PBS) is an essential instrument enabling members and beneficiaries to understand their pension entitlements over time and across different schemes. It should provide clear, comprehensive, and relevant\u00a0information that enables\u00a0members and beneficiaries to assess their financial situation and take any necessary action to secure an adequate pension. Currently, the absence of a uniform approach at Member State level, together with the fact that most members accrue pensions with multiple IORPs during their careers, results in PBSs that vary in format and presentation, thereby limiting comparability and aggregation. Current rules also do not require the inclusion of information on the costs, the performance of investments or on any investment options available and their corresponding risks. To enhance transparency and support informed decision-making, it is necessary to introduce requirements for the design of the PBS and on the provision of information on costs, investment returns and investment options. For the same reason, it is necessary to ensure greater standardisation\u00a0and, where possible,\u00a0alignment with the PEPP Benefit Statement\u00a0referred to in Article 36 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1238, while taking into account the defined benefit or defined contribution characteristics of the pension schemes, and the specificities of occupational pension provision.\u00a0\n\n(34)\nPersistent underperformance of IORPs may reduce the value of members\u2019 and beneficiaries\u2019 accrued rights and undermine trust in supplementary pensions. In line with the\u00a0Implementing Guidelines of the OECD Recommendation on Core Principles of Private Pension Regulation, performance should be comparably disclosed and assessed against clear and objective benchmarks reflecting the investment policy. There is currently no harmonised framework to inform members and beneficiaries of underperformance. To address that, IORPs should be required to promptly inform their competent authority and provide evidence that the scheme\u2019s costs and charges are justified and proportionate, and that the scheme is in line with the risk tolerance of its members and beneficiaries. Where the competent authority is not satisfied with such justification or underperformance persists for at least three years, IORPs should communicate clearly to members and beneficiaries about such\u00a0underperformance, explain its causes, and\u00a0outline measures to remedy the situation. Member States should\u00a0ensure the establishment of objective benchmarks for assessing underperformance.\n\n(35)\nWith increasing life expectancy, members and beneficiaries may face greater need to manage longevity risk, and retirement savings need to be managed effectively to provide adequate income during the decumulation phase. Directive (EU) 2016/2341 requires IORPs to provide general information during the pre-retirement and pay-out phases but does not specify the type of information needed to support members and beneficiaries in making informed choices during decumulation. To enhance transparency, comparability, and informed decision-making, IORPs should therefore be subject to\u00a0minimum disclosure requirements for the decumulation phase. Such disclosures should be clear, accessible, and proportionate, taking into account national specificities, and should cover pay-out options, associated costs and charges, applicable taxes, risks, and projections, including for variable annuities.\n\n(36)\nThe shift from defined benefit pension schemes to defined contribution pension schemes places greater financial risk on members and beneficiaries, as variable benefits replace previously guaranteed benefits. Members and beneficiaries are often faced with complex choices regarding benefits or investments, and their ability to make appropriate decisions can be impaired by information asymmetries, limited knowledge or understanding, behavioural biases, or complex and inadequate choice environments. Combining multiple choices further increases the difficulty for members and beneficiaries to assess the potential effects of their decisions. IORPs play a key role in safeguarding the long-term interests of members and beneficiaries through prudent management of assets and sound governance. To strengthen confidence in the system and ensure that investment decisions remain aligned with members\u2019 best interests, fiduciary duties relating to risk management and investment policy should be reinforced.\u00a0To enhance protection and ensure that pension schemes deliver outcomes that members and beneficiaries might reasonably expect, IORPs should be subject to a general duty of care. Such duty should\u00a0require institutions to act honestly, fairly, and professionally in the best interests of members and beneficiaries, to seek adequate, risk-adjusted and cost-efficient returns over the long term, and to provide guidance and safeguards to support informed and suitable decision-making, taking into account the nature of the pension scheme, the risks borne by members and beneficiaries, the responsibilities of the institution, and, where relevant, the role of social partners and sponsors.\n\n(37)\nOccupational pensions are long-term arrangements on which workers rely to secure an adequate retirement income. Members in defined contribution schemes face specific risks, including retirement income risk, investment risk, costs and charges, administrative and governance risks, and gaps in knowledge. To design appropriate investment strategies and offer suitable investment options that align with members\u2019 capacity to bear losses and their risk-return preferences, IORPs have a central role in assessing these risks from the perspective of members and beneficiaries. To support informed decision-making and safeguard members\u2019 interests, IORPs should conduct long-term risk assessments, provide relevant investment choices, and deliver key information, including all costs and charges and projections, taking into account national specificities.\u00a0\n\n(38)\nTo ensure that members and beneficiaries can effectively exercise their rights and have access to fair and timely redress, IORPs\u00a0should\u00a0establish effective complaints-handling procedures and provide information on available alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. For the same reason, Member States should have in place adequate, independent and impartial alternative dispute resolution bodies, including for cross-border cases, and ensure that competent authorities can receive and respond to complaints alleging infringements of Directive (EU) 2016/2341.\n\n(39)\nDifferences in the powers, tools, and practices available to competent authorities across Member States may hinder effective supervision of IORPs and the timely prevention or correction of infringements. Without the powers to obtain necessary information, to require compliance with applicable laws and regulations, to review and evaluate IORPs\u2019 strategies, processes, and reporting procedures, or to impose sanctions, competent authorities may be unable to ensure that IORPs maintain sufficient financial resources, comply with governance and risk management requirements, or can withstand adverse events or changes in economic conditions. To address those risks, Member States should ensure that competent authorities have all necessary powers\u00a0to obtain information, conduct systematic and risk-based\u00a0reviews and assessments, monitor deteriorating financial conditions, engage in regular\u00a0supervisory dialogue, take preventive and corrective measures in a timely manner, and impose effective, proportionate, and dissuasive administrative sanctions.\u00a0\n\n(40)\nIORPs vary significantly in terms of scale, operational efficiency, and organisational structure. Smaller or fragmented IORPs may face difficulties in achieving economies of scale, engaging in effective asset pooling, or optimising operational and investment efficiency. Early identification of structural challenges and vulnerabilities is therefore essential to ensure that IORPs can deliver value for members and beneficiaries over the long term. Competent authorities play an important role in fostering strategic reflection by IORPs on their long-term sustainability, including on aspects such as scale, organisational configuration, and potential for consolidation or cooperation where those are ways to address identified shortcomings. Competent authorities should therefore conduct regular structured supervisory dialogues with IORPs, during which IORPs can identify potential weaknesses and consider strategic options, including measures to enhance efficiency, scale, and resource sharing, while retaining primary responsibility for ensuring that members and beneficiaries receive adequate retirement benefits.\n\n(41)\nWithout timely, complete, and comparable information, competent authorities may be unable to assess compliance, monitor risks, or take preventive and corrective measures effectively. To address that issue, Member States should ensure that competent authorities have the powers\u00a0to require IORPs to submit all information necessary for supervision, to carry out on-site inspections, and to obtain detailed reporting on costs, charges, and investment returns.\n\n(42)\nThe outsourcing of key functions or other activities by IORPs can generate economies of scale and bring value or lower costs to members and beneficiaries. However, it may also create additional risks and hinder effective supervision. Without access to relevant information and business premises, and without cooperation from service providers, competent authorities may be unable to monitor outsourced activities or ensure compliance. To address those risks, Member States should ensure that IORPs enable competent authorities to access data and premises of service providers\u00a0and to carry out on-site inspections directly or through delegated authorities. IORPS should also fully cooperate during supervision. To ensure effective cross-border supervision of outsourced functions, EIOPA should be able to assist competent authorities in joint on-site inspections.\n\n(43)\nTransparent, comparable, and easily accessible information on the total annual costs, past performance, and risk profiles of pension schemes operated by IORPs is essential for members and beneficiaries to make informed decisions about their retirement savings. Such disclosure could foster efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and the potential to achieve economies of scale, ultimately benefiting members and beneficiaries. To ensure comparability and accessibility, competent authorities should publish that\u00a0information on a single public website for all relevant pension schemes or investment options, covering at least the previous ten years.\n\n(44)\nWhere cross-border activities are significant with respect to the market of the host Member State and require close collaboration between the competent authorities of the home Member State and the host Member State, especially where an IORP might risk being in financial difficulties to the detriment of members and beneficiaries, EIOPA should be able to set up and coordinate collaboration platforms, in a similar manner as under Directive 2009/138/EC\u00a0of the European Parliament and of the Council 35 .\n\n(45)\nInsurance undertakings and insurance intermediaries can also distribute occupational pension products. To ensure that all prospective members, members and\u00a0beneficiaries receive equivalent information and protection, such undertakings and intermediaries should be subject to rules\u00a0related to information consistent with those applicable to IORPs, including obligations relating to the transmission of information to pension tracking systems.\n\n(46)\nIn order to attain the objectives set out in Directive (EU) 2016/2341 and this Directive, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of certain technical parameters in Directive (EU) 2016/2341 stemming from Council Directive 79/267/EEC, which have remained unchanged since their introduction, as well as on the Pension Benefit Statement. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.\n\n(47)\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the provisions on reporting of investment returns, net of investment costs, and all costs and charges incurred in connection with the IORPs\u2019 activities, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No\u00a0180/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council 36 .\n\n(48)\nDirectives (EU) 2016/97 and (EU) 2016/2341 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n(49)\nAmendments to Directive (EU) 2016/2341 regarding the authorisation of IORPs should replace the current regime of registration or authorisation in order to ensure consistent supervisory standards across the Union. However, it would be too burdensome to require all IORPs to apply for a new authorisation. IORPs already registered or authorised under that Directive should be given Therefore, Member States should provide for automatic recognition of IORPs which were already registered or authorised under that Directive.\n\n(50)\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council applies to the processing of personal data for the purposes of this Directive. Member States should ensure that processing of data carried out in application of this Directive fully respects Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 37 where that Directive is applicable.\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\nArticle 1\n\nAmendments to Directive (EU) 2016/2341\n\nDirective (EU) 2016/2341 is amended as follows:\n\n(1)\nthe words\u00a0\u2018registered or authorised\u2019 are replaced by \u2018authorised\u2019 throughout the Directive;\n\n(2)\nthe words \u2018size, nature, scale and complexity\u2019 are replaced by \u2018nature, scale and complexity\u2019 throughout the Directive;\n\n(3)\nthe words \u2018their size and internal organisation, as well as to the size, nature, scale and complexity of their activities\u2019 are replaced by \u2018the nature, scale and complexity of their activities\u2019 throughout the Directive;\n\n(4)\nArticle 2 is amended as follows:\n\n(a)\nin paragraph 1, the second sentence is replaced by the following:\n\n\u2018Where, in accordance with national law, IORPs are constituted in a form under which authorised entities are responsible for operating them and acting on their behalf, Member States shall apply this Directive either to those IORPs or, subject to paragraph 2, to such authorised entities, or to both, as appropriate.\u2019;\n\n(b)\nthe following paragraph 3 is added:\n\n\u20183. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where, pursuant to paragraph 1, authorised entities are responsible for operating IORPs and acting on their behalf, Member States shall ensure that the assets of the IORPs are legally separate from those of the\u00a0authorised entities.\u00a0\n\nFor the purposes of the first subparagraph, where the authorised entities referred to in paragraph 2, point (b), operate IORPs and act on their behalf, Member States shall not restrict such authorised entities established in another Member State from carrying out those activities.\u2019;\n\n(5)\nArticles 3 and 4 are\u00a0replaced by the following:\n\n\u2018Article 3\nApplication to IORPs operating social security schemes\n\nIORPs which also operate pension schemes that are considered to be social security schemes covered by Regulations (EC) No 883/2004 and (EC) No 987/2009 shall be covered by this Directive in respect of their retirement provision business not covered by those Regulations.

In addition, the review aims to remove barriers that hinder efficient investment in the real economy and to facilitate the scaling up of pension providers, enabling them to benefit from economies of scale, improve asset allocation, and deliver greater value to members and beneficiaries. In doing so, the reform seeks to raise standards across the supplementary pensions landscape, fostering greater value, increased resilience and enhanced long-term security for members.\n\n1.3.2.\nSpecific objective(s)\n\nThe specific objectives of the proposed amendments to Directive (EU) 2016/2341 are the following:\n\n- Streamlining investment rules to remove undue regulatory constraints that limit the ability of private pension providers to invest efficiently, even where members and beneficiaries do not bear investment risks.\n\n- Promoting economies of scale, which determine IORPs\u2019 capacity to invest in sophisticated, riskier and illiquid financial instrument.\n\n- Providing Member States with an option to extend the application of Directive (EU) 2016/2341 to institutions otherwise excluded from its scope, where such institutions are not covered by any other Union prudential framework.\n\n- Fostering more professional and efficient management of retirement savings and strengthening supervision. While retirement savers are not in the position to monitor pension providers\u2019 activity and request corrective measures, supervisors can, and their mandate should encompass stronger supervision of the system of governance and investment performance.\n\n1.3.3.\nExpected result(s) and impact\n\n- More efficient management of retirement savings and supervision thereof\n\n- Promotion of scale and prudent access to higher long term capital market investment by improving the regulatory environment in which IORPs operate\n\n- Greater scale and cross-border efficiencies in the supplementary pensions sector\n\n- Clearer implementation of the prudent person principle which can nudge IORPs towards investment policies that efficiently and effectively combine risk mitigation with long-term return objectives.\n\n1.3.4.\nIndicators of performance\n\nThrough this proposal, the Commission aims to enable \u2013 and will monitor \u2013 the following:\n\n- Further consolidation and scaling-up of pension institutions\n\n- Higher long term investments in capital markets and the real economy\n\n- Lower costs and better performance on pension savings, as disclosed by competent authorities\n\n1.4.\nThe proposal/initiative relates to:\u00a0\n\n\u00a8\u00a0a new action\u00a0\n\n\u00a8\u00a0a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action\n\n38 \u00a0\n\n\u2611\ufe0e\u00a0the extension of an existing action\u00a0\n\n\u00a8\u00a0a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action\n\n1.5.\nGrounds for the proposal/initiative\u00a0\n\n1.5.1.\nRequirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative\n\nWith this proposal, the Commission proposes a Directive amending Directive (EU) 2016/2341. Member States will have 12 months to transpose the amendments introduced by this Directive from the entry into force.\n\n1.5.2.\nAdded value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.\n\nThe Directive on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision (IORPs) has been established at EU level since 2016, because only Union action can set a common regulatory framework for IORP providers. In this regard, in order to revise rules, including in relation to cross-border activities, action at EU level through an amending Directive is required.\n\n1.5.3.\nLessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\nNot applicable\n\n1.5.4.\nCompatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments\n\nNot applicable\n\n1.5.5.\nAssessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment\n\nThe proposal further clarifies EIOPA\u2019s role in supervisory coordination, which already forms an integral part of its mandate. The explicit introduction of the possibility to establish collaboration platform does not alter EIOPA\u2019s mandate and is not expected to affect its ability to deliver on its mandate within existing resources.\n\n1.6.\nDuration of the proposal/initiative and of its financial impact\n\n\u00a8\u00a0limited duration\n\n\u2013\n\u00a8 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to

In this vein, the European Union established the legal objective of becoming a climate-neutral and climate resilient continent by 2050 in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 on the European Climate Law, and it also committed to deliver an environmental transition supported by an innovative and circular economy, where biodiversity and ecosystems are protected and restored, and where pollution and environment-related health risks are reduced to the minimum as well as to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 2 .\n\nThe EU estimates that to meet the objectives of the European Green Deal and RepowerEU alone, additional investments of about EUR 620 billion annually between 2023 and 2030 will be needed, which amounts to 3.7% of the EU\u2019s 2023 GDP 3 . The bulk of these will need to continue to flow from private sources, also building on efforts to ensure deeper and more integrated EU capital markets 4 . As a response to market demand and reflecting that achieving EU sustainability goals requires significant investments, with the bulk of it being provided by private financing, the European Commission introduced ambitious sustainability rules in financial services in recent years 5 , building up the Sustainable Finance framework that includes the SFDR.\n\nApplicable since March 2021, the SFDR was one of the first pieces of the EU Sustainable Finance framework. The SFDR is a disclosure framework which sets detailed sustainability disclosures for financial intermediaries and financial products regarding Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors. Its objective is to increase transparency, combat greenwashing and protect end-investors by ensuring that financial market participants (FMPs) and financial advisers substantiate their ESG disclosures. The latter are required to ensure appropriate sustainability information to investors on their websites and in pre-contractual and periodic disclosures for financial products.\n\nThe Regulation rests on two pillars. First, it requires entity-level disclosures, namely for FMPs and financial advisers to explain how they integrate ESG considerations into their internal procedures, including their due diligence processes and consideration of responsible business practices. A crucial element is the introduction of the concept of double materiality, meaning that FMPs must not only consider sustainability risks (i.e. risks to their operations) but must also assess the impact of their investment decisions on the environment and society.\n\nSecond, as regards product-level disclosures, the SFDR encompasses a broad range of financial products including investment funds, insurance and pension products, requiring those within its scope that promote sustainability characteristics to be substantiated with accompanying disclosures. The SFDR in its Article 8 establishes that, for products that promote environmental or social characteristics, FMPs must show how the characteristics are promoted and met. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 9 of the SFDR, for products that have sustainable investment as their objective, FMPs must explain the sustainable objective and show how the objective is attained. Finally, for all products in the scope of the SFDR, under Article 6, FMPs must disclose how sustainability risks are integrated in the investment decision process and the results of the assessment of the likely impacts of sustainability risks on the returns of the products, where relevant, or explain why this is not the case. Double materiality also applies at product level. The responsibility for supervising these disclosures lies with the National Competent Authorities in each EU Member State while the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) play a coordinating role.\n\nThe SFDR and other pieces of sustainable finance legislation have had broad-reaching effects on the market. According to the Platform on Sustainable Finance (PSF) 6 , a Commission expert group, the market development of funds that make claims in regulatory filings to be sustainable has been very sizeable in the EU since the SFDR was launched in 2021, clearly outpacing until 2023 the development of funds not stating to be considered sustainable 7 . Products disclosing ESG information under SFDR account for almost 50% of EU Assets under Management, representing more than 60% of EU funds: funds that promote ESG characteristics (in accordance with Article 8) accounted for 57.6% as of June 2024, while funds that have sustainability as one of their investment objectives (in accordance with Article 9) represented 3.4% of EU funds 8 . Europe is by far the largest market for such funds, accounting for up to 84% of global sustainable fund assets 9 .\n\nThe Political Guidelines of the European Commission for 2024-2029 have reaffirmed that the EU will stay the course on the goals set out in the European Green Deal and aim to further scale-up sustainable finance in support of this as part of deeper more integrated capital markets. The focus is now also on simplification: reducing administrative burdens linked e.g. to sustainability reporting, with simpler rules, and better enforcement. In this context, it is important to consider whether the SFDR can be made more efficient, in line with these political priorities and policy objectives, and in the context of overarching efforts to improve the integration of EU financial markets to support productive investments 10 . A review of the SFDR is also foreseen in Article 19 of the Regulation.\n\nThe need for simplification in the field of sustainability reporting and due diligence was highlighted as well in the report \u201cThe future of European competitiveness\u201d by M. Draghi, which underlined that excessive regulatory and administrative burden could hinder the competitiveness of EU companies compared to those from other blocs. According to the report, parts of the EU sustainable finance framework entail a major compliance cost for companies in the EU.\n\nThe evidence gathered to date as part of the review under Article 19 of the Regulation on the implementation of the SFDR signals that, while its objectives remain broadly supported, it is widely seen as a complex and costly regime 11 . There have been calls for significantly simplifying and reducing the administrative burdens linked to the rules 12 . The SFDR review has therefore been included among the simplification initiatives of the European Commission in the Mission Letter to the Commissioner for Financial Services and the Savings and Investments Union 13 and in the 2025 Commission Work Programme 14 .\n\n1.2.\nLegal context\n\nThe SFDR is supplemented by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/2018 15 , published in April 2022 and amended in February 2023, with regulatory technical standards specifying key elements of the disclosure regime, notably in relation to sustainability indicators and adverse sustainability impacts, and the content and presentation of the information in relation to the promotion of environmental or social characteristics and sustainable investment objectives in pre-contractual documents, on websites and in periodic reports.\n\nIt should also be noted that the SFDR interacts with ESMA\u2019s Guidelines on funds\u2019 names using ESG or sustainability-related terms 16 . The guidelines stem from the strong demand in recent years for investment funds that incorporate ESG factors and the competitive market pressures for asset managers to include terminology in their funds\u2019 names to attract investors\u00a0which caused concern in ESMA over heightened greenwashing risks: i.e. that funds would be named as green or socially sustainable, while commensurate sustainability standards are not met.\n\nFurther, the SFDR interacts with the other pieces of legislation of the sustainable finance framework, including the EU Taxonomy 17 , EU Benchmark Regulation 18 , Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) 19 , the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) 20 , as well as relevant parts of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) 21 and Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD) 22 and links with the Shareholder Rights Directive (SRD) 23 . Together, they help support companies and the financial sector in directing private funding into sustainable investment projects and technologies.\u00a0In particular, reporting obligations for FMPs under the current SFDR largely depend on the reporting obligations for companies under the CSRD and the Taxonomy Regulation. Therefore, the review of the SFDR will duly take into consideration the changes introduced by the proposed \u2018Omnibus\u2019 simplifications regarding sustainability information from companies 24 .\u00a0Annex 6 describes in detail the interactions between the SFDR and the rest of the framework and highlights the special considerations regarding these interactions for the review.\n\n2.\nPROBLEM DEFINITION\n\nThe SFDR sets a series of entity level disclosure requirements for financial market participants and financial advisers. They must disclose how they integrate sustainability risks into their investment decision-making processes (Article 3) and remuneration policies (Article 5). Large firms (more than 500 employees) must also disclose how they consider the principal adverse impacts of their investment decisions on sustainability factors, while others are subject to a comply or explain approach (Article 4).\n\nThe SFDR also sets a series of product level disclosure requirements. All financial products in scope 25 must disclose whether and how they consider sustainability risks (Article 6). Financial products promoting environmental or social characteristics (Article 8) or those with a sustainable investment objective (Article 9) must provide detailed sustainability-related disclosures in their pre-contractual and periodic reporting (Article 10) as well as on their website (Article 11).\n\nThe SFDR also provides a definition for the concept of \u2018sustainable investment\u2019 (SI), which underpins the Article 9 disclosures (and the Article 8 disclosures to a lesser extent). It is defined as an economic activity that contributes to an environmental or social objective, provided that such investments do not significantly harm (DNSH) any of those objectives and that the investee companies follow good governance practices. Importantly, the DNSH is based on the \u2018consideration\u2019 of a number of principal adverse impact indicators (PAIs) provided in Annex I of the delegated regulation.\n\nThe assessment carried out for the review of the underlying drivers behind the problems associated with the SFDR is explained in detail in Annex 11 (Evaluation). On this basis, four regulatory problem drivers were identified:\n\nFirst, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) has faced widespread criticism for being unclear, complex, and difficult to implement, particularly regarding sustainability-related concepts and disclosure requirements. A key issue is the definition of \"sustainable investment,\" which includes complex criteria and lacks clarity, especially in relation to the \"do no significant harm\" principle. Uncertainty also surrounds what constitutes the \"promotion\" of sustainability characteristics and how to apply entity- and product-level disclosures on principal adverse impacts. These challenges create ambiguity for financial market participants (FMPs), who must navigate unclear requirements and undefined terms. Additionally, the disclosure obligations are often lengthy, overly technical, and lack comparability, reducing their value for end-investors and undermining efforts to combat greenwashing.\n\nSecond, another significant problem stems from legal misalignments between the SFDR and other EU sustainable finance legislation, such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the EU Taxonomy, and MiFID/IDD. These frameworks are meant to work together, but inconsistencies in legal definitions and technical requirements create confusion and hinder legal certainty. Notable discrepancies exist in how sustainability is defined across the SFDR, the Taxonomy Regulation, and the EU Climate Benchmarks, leading to fragmentation and implementation difficulties.\n\nThird, the lack of reliable and comprehensive ESG data further hampers effective disclosures. FMPs and financial advisors rely on sustainability information from issuers, but such data is often incomplete or unavailable. This data gap results partly from inconsistencies across the legislative frameworks and from limited ESG disclosure obligations for assets not covered by EU rules, especially those located outside the EU.\n\nFinally, the SFDR\u2019s disclosures \u2014Articles 6, 8, and 9\u2014are frequently misused as de facto labels by FMPs, investors, and distributors, despite the regulation not being designed as a labelling framework and lacking harmonised standards. This leads to confusion and inconsistency in their use and interpretation.\n\nAs summarised in the conclusion of Annex 11, there are a number of root causes for these problem drivers, for a framework which has been in application for only a relatively short period of time,\u00a0and which inform the lessons learned for the review. Different dates of application for the Level 1 and Level 2 implementing measures of the SFDR 26 created uncertainty around the key requirements and concepts of the SFDR from the outset 27 . Challenges in accessing ESG data needed to comply with the new requirements were present from the beginning, exacerbated by the way the SFDR began to apply before other parts of the sustainable finance framework, namely the CSRD and EU Taxonomy, which were intended to increasingly inform product disclosures under the SFDR. Throughout, it also became increasingly evident that investors were not well served by the new, lengthy and complicated disclosures and rules, something which contributed to markets adopting the main disclosure Articles 6, 8 and 9 as a short-hand, misleading technique to convey a high-level sense of diverse products\u2019 key features 28 .\n\n Box 1: problem tree\n\n2.1.\nWhat are the problems?\n\nAgainst this background, it is useful to make a distinction between problems which have resulted for preparers of the SFDR disclosures (i.e. financial market participants) on the one hand, and users of the SFDR disclosures (end-investors and distributors) on the other.\n\nProblems for FMPs, from a preparer perspective: FMPs are facing difficulties in coping with the lengthy and complex disclosure requirements detailed in the Level 2 Regulation, and in navigating the uncertainty surrounding key sustainability-related obligations and concepts. These lead to high undue burdens and costs which can negatively affect FMPs\u2019 ability and willingness to develop ESG products 29 (compared to the absence of such requirements for non-ESG products).\n\nProblems for investors and distributors, from a user perspective: investors and distributors cannot easily understand or compare ESG claims made by preparers of financial products as per the above, creating misinterpretation and misrepresentation risks, which are being exacerbated by the misuse of the disclosure regime as a de facto labelling system despite the lack of common criteria that could be fit for this purpose.\n\n2.1.1.\nSpecific problems from a preparer perspective\n\nFMPs are struggling to cope with the lengthy and complex disclosure requirements and face uncertainty about SFDR compliance.\n\nFirst, FMPs are facing difficulties in accessing the necessary data from underlying investments 30 . They\u00a0often struggle to collect, measure or quantify certain indicators to comply with their reporting obligations (described in section 2.2.). 98% of FMPs who responded to the public consultation (176 out of 180) stated facing difficulties in obtaining good-quality data 31 .\n\nThis is partly due to misalignments in scope between the SFDR and the other sustainable finance rules, and the fact that FMPs invest a large portion of their portfolio in assets that are not subject to EU legislation. As explained in the evaluation,\u00a0Annex 11 (and\u00a0Annex 6 on the different pieces of the sustainable finance framework), CSRD and EU Taxonomy Regulation disclosures were supposed to feed into the SFDR reporting requirements (i.e. ensuring that FMPs are receiving high quality and publicly available ESG data from their underlying investments). However, the scope of assets included in FMPs\u2019 portfolios is much larger than the respective scopes of the CSRD and the EU Taxonomy 32 . As a result, FMPs are not getting public information for certain EU assets (e.g. small non listed companies) and for their investments outside the EU.\n\nTo illustrate this point, between 30% and 50% of the average holdings of EU asset managers consist of entities not subject to CSRD reporting requirements (and therefore do not publish Taxonomy or CSRD related sustainability data) 33 . For example, the Platform for Sustainable Finance (PSF)\u00a0highlights the lack of Taxonomy reporting outside of the European Union 34 and shows that PAI data is not universally available, despite several indicators. The evidence showed in the evaluation, Annex 11, boxes 12 and 13 shows that companies in the sample (12,000 issuers) were largely able to report data for over half of the mandatory PAIs. However, no single issuer reported data across all indicators. In addition, the evidence shows that the data availability for mandatory PAIs varies widely depending on the indicators and on the type of companies. For example, the SFDR mandatory environmental PAI coverage for small and medium EU companies is close to 0%, and the one of large EU companies is about 30 to 40%. Further, some indicators are being reported by less than 10% of issuers, such as the PAI on biodiversity, water, violations of the UNGC principles ad OECD Guidelines for SMEs, and gender pay gap.\n\nAs a result, FMPs often source the missing data either internally or commercially from third party providers 35 . The over-reliance on the use of estimates, coupled with the lack of guidance on how to produce such estimates and the lack of regulatory framework on third-party providers of such estimates, results in additional operational, regulatory and reputational risk for FMPs.\n\nIn addition, FMPs are\u00a0facing difficulties in applying the complex and sometimes mis-aligned sustainability-related concepts underlying the disclosure requirements 36 . The bulk of the complexities (as described in the evaluation annex 11 section 3.1) comes from the multiple layers of the sustainability assessment introduced by the definition of sustainable investment (Article 2(17) SFDR) as well as several misalignments between the SFDR concepts and sustainability-related concepts defined under other pieces of the sustainable finance framework (e.g. the EU Taxonomy and the EU Climate Benchmarks) 37 .\n\nAs a result, FMPs pointed to several operational difficulties when applying certain SFDR concepts. For example, 80% of FMPs that responded to the public consultation stated facing uncertainty and methodological challenges with the requirement to \u2018take into account of\u2019\u00a0the principal adverse impact (PAI) indicators established in the Level 2 Regulation at entity level for the \u2018do no significant harm\u2019(DNSH) test at product level 38 . Stakeholders also flagged difficulties when applying the Taxonomy-related concepts or the EU Climate Benchmark due to misalignments and legal uncertainties regarding the status of investments in taxonomy aligned economic activities and of products tracking EU climate benchmarks under the SFDR.\n\nThe problems mentioned have been notably acute for FMPs active in the pension and insurance sectors.\u00a0Pension products, schemes and insurance-based investment products are covered the SFDR disclosures, yet some of the main assets they invest in (i.e. including sovereign debt), maintained for regulatory and diversification purposes, cannot be easily assessed against specific metrics in the SFDR and broader ESG framework (i.e. principal adverse impacts, taxonomy-alignment, etc). This, coupled with data availability issues, has led to difficulties for them to align their portfolios with the defined sustainability concepts (i.e. taxonomy-alignment or sustainable investment), hindering these FMPs from providing an accurate picture of their ESG profile 39 .\u00a0\n\nFMPs have also reported barriers to implement strategies linked to transition finance due to the misalignments between the underlying elements of the SFDR sustainable investment definition and the features of transitional investments (more details in the evaluation annex 11).\n\nFinally, FMPs are facing uncertainty about SFDR compliance due to the lack of clarity surrounding key sustainability-related concepts and their interactions 40 . As noted in the evaluation, Annex 11, different interpretations of the regulatory requirements are possible and have led FMPs to adopt different approaches. This is particularly the case for the calculation of sustainable investment exposure, which led to diverging approaches within the market and yielded significantly different outcomes/results (see box 9, 10 and 11 in annex 11\u00a0illustrative examples and explanation).\u00a0\n\nThe ambiguity of the legal text poses difficulties for a uniform interpretation and implementation of the law. While a certain level of flexibility is desirable and necessary for product innovation and to accommodate different ESG strategies and assets, the important differences in FMPs\u2019 implementation approaches have raised doubts concerning the regulatory expectations under the SFDR. In addition, the lack of transparency on the approaches taken and underlying methodologies has created concerns about potential misinterpretation for both investors and distributors/advisers. (see evaluation, Annex 11)\n\nThe ESAs and Commission have provided extensive guidance in the shape of Q&As to facilitate common interpretations and practical application 41 . However, this has not prevented some national competent authorities (NCAs) from assuming\u00a0diverging national supervisory expectations (e.g. what they consider as an acceptable approach to \u2018sustainable investment\u2019) and the emergence of additional national requirements (e.g. minimum criteria for communicating on ESG features and ESG national labels). A summary of the different national rules and labels is provided in Annex 9.\n\nAs a result, most respondents of the public consultations confirmed that these limitations (i.e. lack of clarity and diverging national supervisory expectations and rules) are currently creating high\nlevels of legal uncertainty (79%, 233 out of 296) 42 and reputation risks for FMPs and financial advisers (80%, 237 out of 297) 43 .\n\nAs a result, FMPs are facing excessive compliance costs and burdens\n\nThe complexities of the SFDR concepts and the length of the disclosure obligations are creating considerable burdens on FMPs. The implementation has been reported as very costly, time consuming, and the resources needed have been flagged as disproportionate.\n\nIn addition, the lack of clarity of the requirements and the inconsistencies, as well as some overlaps 44 with the rest of the sustainable finance framework is generating additional undue costs and efforts for FMPs 45 .\u00a0National gold plating measures and diverging national expectations also translate into additional burdens, especially for FMPs marketing products in different member states (need to meet different regulatory expectations).\n\nFinally, the lack of availability/comparability of ESG information from underlying investments on a geographical/jurisdictional basis links with increases in search costs for investors (see next section, thereby undermining their ability to scale their investment strategies internationally.\n\n2.1.2.\nSpecific problems from a user perspective (investors and distributors)\n\nInvestors (and distributors) cannot easily understand or compare the ESG features and claims of financial products\n\nFirst, the length and complexity of the SFDR disclosures have not empowered end-investors (and distributors) to understand and compare ESG features 46 . The information provided to investors at the level of product is \u2018not easily comprehensible and demands a high level of familiarity with environmental metrics, performance data and the regulatory framework\u2019 47 . The SFDR concepts (e.g. \u2018taxonomy-alignment\u2019, \u2018proportion of sustainable investment\u2019, \u2018consideration of principal adverse impact\u2019) contrast starkly with the way retail investors express their sustainability preferences, and many investors do not possess the necessary understanding to interpret such information. This affects their ability to assess the sustainability performance of financial products. Findings from the majority of the EU consumer studies conducted in recent years confirm these statements.\n\nConsumers\u2019 associations also argue that \u2018pre-disclosure templates are unnecessarily long and can be very confusing and time consuming for retail investors 48 \u2019 and \u2018and not designed in a way that can be easily understood 49 \u2019. Certain studies also argue that such \u2018overflow of complex disclosures form a\u00a0barrier to understanding the ESG strategy employed in their investments 50 \u2019. The findings are summarised in annex 10.\n\nThis assessment is reflected in the responses to the public consultation, with 84% (249 out of 296) of respondents stating that the disclosures required by the SFDR are not sufficiently useful to investors 51 . A majority of stakeholders also sees limited usefulness in the SFDR disclosures provided at the level of the entities to end-investors, with only 31% (86 out of 281) of respondents to the public consultation considering them useful. According to EFAMA, retail investors typically focus on disclosures in relation to specific financial products rather than the companies managing these products. Consequently, \u2018the demand for entity-level disclosures is relatively low, as (investors\u2019) primary concern lies with the details of the individual investment products themselves\u2019 52 .\u00a0\n\nIn addition, the disclosures made under the SFDR\u00a0often lack comparability 53 . Different interpretations of the regulation have led FMPs to adopt different approaches when applying key SFDR concepts, especially the calculation of sustainable investment exposure (see the illustrative example in the evaluation annex 11\u00a0box 11). As a result, products with similar mandates and portfolios will report divergent exposures to sustainable investments depending on the methodology chosen. The lack of transparency regarding the approach taken and the underlying methodologies is making it impossible for end-investors to compare competing products. The discretion in how to consider PAIs also does not ensure comparability, while reporting on products\u2019 Taxonomy-alignment is limited and only gives a partial account of their overall footprint. The reasons underlying the lack of comparability are further described in the evaluation,\u00a0Annex 11 under section 3.1.1.\u00a0\n\nDistributors are facing similar difficulties when having to interpret SFDR disclosures to implement the sustainability preferences rules under MiFID and IDD. Distributors have to provide clients that expressed sustainability preferences with suitable investments that reflect (among others) such preferences. In doing so, distributors have to assess, for each product they distribute, to what target market a given product will be suitable. Their assessments rely, among others, on information disclosed by product manufacturers under the SFDR. These disclosures do not enable them to develop sufficient knowledge of the sustainability profile of the products they distribute, leading to reputational risks and operational costs (to implement additional due diligence processes and checks).\n\nAn additional problem for distributors (and ultimately for retail investors) is the lack of sustainability disclosure requirements comparable to SFDR disclosures for several financial instruments as defined under MiFID and PRIIPs that may be distributed to clients with sustainability preferences, such as shares, bonds, and structured notes. This is due to\u00a0differences in objectives and scope between the SFDR and MiFID (and PRIIP), for instance disclosure obligations under MiFID cover investor protection more generally than those under SFDR or PRIIPs, and due to differences in type of financial product coverage 54 . Stakeholders have flagged that this issue is particularly problematic for structured notes which currently fall outside the scope of the SFDR despite having common features with investment funds, thereby giving rise to a form of regulatory arbitrage.\n\nAn additional obstacle to investors\u2019 understanding is that ESG claims in product names and marketing materials do not always accurately reflect the products\u2019 actual ESG objectives or strategies. In fact,\u00a0the SFDR does not include detailed rules on the extent to which financial products can make references to ESG elements in their names or marketing documentations. These claims are only covered by the high-level requirements under the SFDR Article 13 (FMPs must \u2018ensure that their marketing documentations do not contradict the information disclosures\u2019) and MiFID II and IDD (which also provide that all information, including marketing communications shall be fair, clear, and not misleading).\n\nThe lack of minimum ESG transparency or performance requirements for making such claims has led NCAs to adopt different national approaches, adding complexity to the different rules and different levels of safeguards against greenwashing. The ESMA guidelines 55 partly addresses this regulatory gap by introducing minimum criteria for funds using certain ESG terms in their names. The guidelines aim to bring clarity for investors amid FMPs\u2019 myriad sustainability claims 56 . However, the guidelines do not cover the entirety of financial products in scope of the SFDR and of the MiFID/IDD sustainability preferences rules.\u00a0For example, insurance and pension products are not currently subject to similar rules.\n\nEnd-investors are\u00a0also being misled by the self-categorisation practices 57 \u00a0\n\nAs described in evaluation annex 11,\u00a0the SFDR is \u2018de facto\u2019 being used as a categorisation/labelling system where products disclosing under Article 8 and Article 9 have been commonly referred to as \u2018light green\u2019 and \u2018dark green\u2019 products, respectively.\n\nThe wide, but unintended, use of SFDR disclosures as product labels by the market gives rise to some concerns. First, the Article 8 category based on the \u201cpromotion of environmental or social characteristics\u201d is very broad and lacks minimum quality conditions to serve as a reliable categorisation. Second, the key concepts (e.g. contribution to an environmental or social objective or the DNSH for \u201csustainable investment\u201d) underpinning Article 9 lack clear criteria leading to divergent interpretations and lack of comparability, linked to the problems above.\n\nThe disclosure regimes under Articles 8 and 9 do not have any harmonised criteria that could allow investors (and distributors) to compare the relative ESG performance. This had led to confusion, especially among retail investors, who often assume that products disclosing under Article 9 are fully sustainable and that products disclosing under Article 8 strongly integrate ESG factors, even though this is not necessarily the case 58 .\n\n2.1.3.\nConsequences\n\nFirst, the limitations related to the SFDR concepts and disclosures lead to risks of greenwashing and mis-selling of investment products. The low levels of comparability and reliability of the disclosures, the lack of alignment between products\u2019 ESG claims in names and marketing documentations, and the misuse of the SFDR as a categorisation system give rise to risks for investor protection linked to misrepresentation and misinterpretation. This is further impacted by differing supervisory expectations and lack of criteria underlying key sustainability concepts and obligations. These findings are supported by the responses to the public consultations, with 62% (181 out of 292) of respondents claiming that the SFDR has not effectively strengthened the protection of end investors and 81% (237 out of 297) identifying important risks of greenwashing and mis-selling 59 .\u00a0\n\nSecond, these problems are limiting the EU financial sector\u2019s ability to efficiently allocate capital for Europe\u2019s sustainable prosperity. The lack of clarity and the complexity of the SFDR requirements are currently limiting FMPs\u2019 ability to develop ESG products across the single market without incurring undue costs and burdens. Solutions for investors to effectively channel investments towards projects that advance environmental, social and governance objectives are thus suboptimal or lacking 60 , frustrating the continuing demand on their part for ESG investments.\u00a0In addition, the fact that the SFDR does not define and adequately integrate the concept of transition finance is hindering FMPs from supporting companies while they pivot towards sustainable practices.\n\nFinally, the current SFDR rules are impacting the international competitiveness of the EU financial sector. Undue costs and burdens associated with the implementation of the complex SFDR disclosure regime risk putting EU market actors at a disadvantage compared to FMPs operating in jurisdictions with lighter requirements. In addition, the emergence of various national requirements in the EU pose barriers to cross-border distribution of financial products and prevent the creating of a true single market for ESG financial products, frustrating the potential of the single market to effectively channel savings towards Europe\u2019s sustainable prosperity.\n\n2.2.\nHow likely is the problem to persist?\u00a0\n\nWithout EU-level action, it is highly unlikely that the problems identified for FMPs (preparers) and investors and distributors (users) would be tackled in an effective, efficient and coherent way. Difficulties and undue costs would persist for both groups in navigating the complexities and uncertainties linked to the implementation of the SFDR, amid the need to also observe differing relevant national level requirements as well as the ESMA guidelines for funds.\n\n3.\nWHY SHOULD THE EU ACT?\n\n3.1.\nLegal basis\n\nThe legal basis is the same as for the existing Regulation, namely Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, with the objective of establishing and ensuring the functioning of the internal market, in this case for the sale and distribution of financial products with sustainability-related features.\n\n3.2.\nSubsidiarity: Necessity of EU action\n\nThe need for a coherent common framework for sustainability-related disclosures for financial products across the EU was established as part of the original SFDR. The objectives remain fully valid, and enjoy broad stakeholder support 61 . Without effective Union-level action, the problems identified would persist. That is, financial market participants, financial advisers and distributors, as well as investors would continue to face undue complexity in the application of the rules. Excessively lengthy disclosure rules and templates involving sustainability characteristics in the business practices of financial market participants, as well as in the financial products they offer to investors, would remain in place. A high degree of confusion, uncertainty and a lack of comparability would continue to mark the availability of financial products with sustainability-linked features, negatively impacting their credibility and uptake.\n\nTo overcome these problems and boost the effectiveness and efficiency of the single market for sustainable finance products, the necessary simplification and adjustment of the existing SFDR framework can only be done in a coherent and effective way at EU level. Addressing the problems and consequences arising from the lack of clarity and comparability in the characteristics of sustainability-linked financial products as well as from the undue complexities posed for the operations of financial market participants cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States acting independently. To be sure, actions by Member States to address (some of) the identified problems could help act on some of the problem drivers e.g. by overcoming a lack of clarity as regards sustainability-features of financial products through the introduction of, or continued reliance on, sustainability labels at national level. However, although Member States could individually take such action to strengthen the reliability and comparability of sustainability-linked financial products in their national markets, there is a high risk that any measures of this kind would differ between them. This could give rise to further diverging levels of transparency between national markets, growing disparities in investor confidence in ESG products across Member States, risks of more barriers and challenges for cross-border market participants, and further limits to the comparability of products across the single market. Therefore, such actions could, in isolation and potentially conducted in an uncoordinated manner, further fragment the single market for sustainable finance products and fail to address the consequences identified in the previous section in an efficient way.\n\n3.3.\nSubsidiarity: Added value of EU action\n\nAction at EU level to tackle the identified problems would be conducive to a more harmonised, effective, efficient and coherent outcome across the single market, and in support of the broader strategic objectives of the Union. In contrast to sticking with the status quo and relying on national level actions together with requirements regarding the use of fund names pursuant to the ESMA guidelines, EU level policy measures to address the shortcomings in the current SFDR framework\u00a0would act on the problem drivers in a comprehensive way. Requirements and disclosures could be simplified\u00a0across the board, both for the benefit of financial market participants and investors, in a harmonised way throughout the Union. Common solutions to transparency-related challenges regarding access to ESG datapoints could be designed in a way which facilitates the business of financial market participants in an even way across the EU and protects investors, and tackles information asymmetries, equally regardless of which Member State they are located in. National disparities in available levels of information regarding the sustainability-linked features of financial products could thus be addressed to benefit investors more evenly and fairly across the EU, for instance helping overcome wide national differences today in the relative shares of products disclosing under Articles 8 and 9 of the SFDR 62 .\n\nTherefore, effective EU level action to tackle the problems identified in the previous section would be better to help scale up private sustainable finance across the Union. In turn, this could\u00a0better serve the objective of mobilising funds toward the competitive opportunities in the green transition and other evolving strategic priorities in line with Union objectives. As such, it could ease the pressure off public funds, which are increasingly stretched in terms of competing and new emerging priorities, to finance and catalyse funds towards sustainability objectives. In short, EU level action would boost the proper functioning of the single market for sustainable finance and in addition contribute to improving transparency for investors across the Union to enable their participation in EU capital markets in general, in line with the objectives of the Savings and Investments Union 63 .\n\n4.\nOBJECTIVES: WHAT IS TO BE ACHIEVED?\n\nIn order to tackle the consequences identified in section 2, the initiative aims at pursuing two general objectives, in line with the political guidelines for the current Commission to deliver for Europe\u2019s sustainable prosperity and competitiveness and to unlock private financing and turbo-charge investment as part of deeper and more liquid capital markets 64 . These objectives in turn support investment toward the following Sustainable Development Goals, namely those related to the climate and environment 65 and social progress 66 .\n\nTo reach these general objectives, two specific objectives are identified in order to tackle the problems identified in section 2, and notably to help financial market participants and investors to overcome the complexity of the status quo. These in turn fully respect and support the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.\n\n4.1.\nGeneral objectives\n\nThe first general objective of the initiative is to protect the integrity of the EU single market for sustainable finance by ensuring requirements which mitigate risks of greenwashing, and to better help investors seize opportunities in sustainability-linked financial products. The second general objective is to boost the competitiveness of Europe\u2019s financial sector by ensuring conditions which make business easier and help to deepen our single market for sustainability-linked financial products and thus to efficiently allocate capital for Europe\u2019s sustainable prosperity. Overall, the general objectives of the review are thus conceived to create conditions on both the demand-side and the supply-side to ensure a better use of the potential of the European single market for sustainable finance to contribute to funding the transition towards Europe\u2019s sustainable prosperity and competitiveness.\n\n4.2.\nSpecific objectives\n\nTo reach these objectives, and to tackle the shortcomings observed in the status quo, the measures of the review should pursue two specific objectives. The first specific objective is to simplify and reduce the sustainability-related administrative requirements of the framework for financial market participants, as well as to enhance the coherence of the framework for their operational needs. The second specific objective is to improve end-investors\u2019 ability to understand and compare sustainability-linked financial products. The specific objectives of the initiative thus tackle the main problems which have been identified both for financial market participants on the one hand, and for investors on the other, which inhibit their ability to, respectively, design financial products and deploy corresponding investments in an efficient and effective manner toward the EU\u2019s sustainability, competitiveness and other strategic policy goals.\n\n5.\nWHAT ARE THE AVAILABILITY POLICY OPTIONS?\n\nThe available policy options for the review are assessed against the specific objectives identified above. They are analysed in terms of their relative merits in how well they can simplify and clarify the regulatory expectations under the SFDR while enhancing investor protection and improving their ability to understand the ESG features of financial products. The overarching goals of the policy options are to support the scale up of sustainable finance towards Europe\u2019s sustainability and competitiveness goals in the most effective and efficient fashion.\n\nThis section is structured as follows. Section 5.1 illustrates the baseline scenario of no change to the SFDR. Section 5.2 considers its repeal. Section 5.3 considers a first alternative area of action, namely options for alleviating the reporting burdens through changes to entity-level and product level disclosures. These changes include both a reduction of data points required as well as a simplification of the sustainability-concepts. Section 5.4 considers a second area of action, namely setting up a clear product categorisation system to address the current misuse of the disclosure articles. Section 5.5 discusses some options discarded at an early stage.\n\nThe options in Sections 5.3 and 5.4 relate to one another as follows. The options under Section 5.3.1 to significantly reduce or delete entity level disclosures are distinct. They concern financial market participants\u2019 disclosures at entity-level, regarding their investment decisions and business practices. The options under Section 5.3.2 to make either minimal or more significant changes to sustainability-related product-level disclosures connect closely to the options in Section 5.4 regarding whether and how to set up a categorisation system for those products. The options under Section 5.3.1 could be pursued more in isolation (but coherent with the rest of the EU sustainable finance framework) while those in Sections 5.3.2 would be more difficult to pursue without considering those in Section 5.4. To illustrate, Box 2 shows how the options relate to the problems and specific objectives of previous Sections, while the text below under the options explains further how notably options in Sections 5.3.2 and 5.4 should be pursued more closely together, for a coherent outcome which achieves the objectives effectively and efficiently.\n\nBox 2: how the policy options in Sections 5.3 and 5.4 interact with the problems of the current SFDR and the objectives for the review\n\nThe policy options below focus primarily on the necessary changes to the Level 1 SFDR text. These would need to be complemented by corresponding changes or replacements of the Level 2 Regulation. The policy options are explored to establish all essential features of the disclosures and categories in the Level 1 text, framing the supplementary rules in the Level 2 Regulation (contrary to the current SFDR, which allowed for the elaboration of complex and lengthy level 2 rules, leading to increased complexity and burdens).\n\nSpecific considerations for the formulation of policy options arising from the Omnibus proposal 67 ,\u00a0the ESMA fund name guidelines and the principle of proportionality\n\nOne of the key considerations is to foster coherence between the SFDR and the rest of the sustainable finance framework, and in particular with the changes entailed by the Omnibus proposals in terms of sustainability disclosures applicable to corporates. The policy options for the SFDR review need to be coherent with this new context. Prior to the Omnibus, disclosures from corporates/investees were set to expand over time and provide a wider range of the granular data needed by financial market participants for their own disclosures. Post-Omnibus 68 , the policy options need to take account of the future scope of the disclosures for corporates, which will not improve FMPs\u2019 ability to access ESG data for their underlying investments. Therefore, the future system should reflect the fact that granular sustainability-related information will not be more readily available directly from all investees. Here, it needs to be carefully considered whether the new context under the Omnibus would favour repealing the SFDR and leaving the organisation of information on ESG-features of financial products to the market, or whether other options to review the SFDR would be more effective, efficient and coherent to deliver on the objectives 69 .\n\nSecond, in this context, due consideration should also be given to recognising and building upon current market practices. While not a standalone objective, a sufficient degree of continuity/stability with appropriate criteria in the categorisation of products that are already being applied by the markets, namely reflecting the ESMA fund name guidelines 70 , is considered advisable. These have become\u00a0a broadly accepted and useful source of clarity for FMPs and investors. Duly reflecting them aims to avoid a \u2018re-categorisation\u2019 wave which could be disruptive to the offer of products to investors. It could also be unduly costly for FMPs, especially given evolving data constraints, and be at odds with the overall objective of simplification and burden reduction. Rather, where existing categorisation practices are considered to help support the objectives in Section 4, this should be reflected in the assessment of the relative merits of the options.\n\nFinally, and linked to this, following the principle of proportionality, the options should further seek to work with the grain of market practices and not go beyond what is necessary to reach the objectives, also taking into account other existing regulatory requirements regarding \u2018environmental\u2019 claims 71 . While there is no obligation in the current SFDR for FMPs to offer sustainability-linked products, the scope of its current disclosure requirements is not clearly delineated and as a result applies broadly to the market. As explained in section 2 and Annex 11 (evaluation), the scope of application of the SFDR Article 8 has been subject to different interpretations (from FMPs and supervisors), i.e. the triggers of the mandatory ESG disclosures are not clear and led to a very large scope of financial products falling under these obligations (for example investment funds disclosing under Article 8 accounted for about 51% of the total UCITS and AIF fund market at end of 2024 72 ).\n\nIn this respect, the options should more clearly focus the obligations under SFDR to cater for FMPs which are committed to offering sustainability-linked financial products and for their clients which are interested in investing in them. That is, compared to the status quo, it should be ensured more clearly that the future policy framework constitutes a voluntary regime for FMPs and investors interested in sustainability-linked products. It would apply only in case of explicit decisions by FMPs to offer ESG-focused products and by investors to seek and select them. A key consideration would be that \u2018claims\u2019 by FMPs regarding how and the extent to which financial products invest in, contribute to, or integrate sustainability factors in their investment strategy, understood as any messaging stating or implying environmental or social benefits associated with investments in and by those financial products, would trigger the categorisation of products under the revised SFDR. Conversely, if products do not meet the criteria required by the voluntary categories, they should be restricted from using certain names or be marketed as sustainable or ESG focused.\n\n5.1.\nWhat is the baseline from which options are assessed?\n\nThe baseline scenario assumes no changes are made to the SFDR and that the Omnibus proposals are adopted by co-legislators 73 . In this scenario, the problems and challenges identified in section 2 would continue. Namely, the complexity, burdens, confusion and suboptimal outcomes associated with the current rules, both in terms of disclosures and the misuse of Articles 8 and 9 as labels, would not be tackled. Questions from FMPs how to interpret and implement the rules would continue, adding extensively to the corpus of Level 3 guidance which they have to observe 74 . Certain duplications within the existing sustainable finance framework for financial market participants would remain in place, and\u00a0new challenges arising for them from the Omnibus proposals would emerge. Rather than receiving increasingly granular data from investees as would have been the case prior to the Omnibus, FMPs would have to make do with less for their own disclosures 75 , and from a smaller range of entities.\u00a0In response to a perpetuated status quo, the likelihood of divergent national measures would increase, even more so in case national authorities were to adjust national regimes for financial market participants to reflect the evolving post-Omnibus landscape. Worsening fragmentation of the single market, contrary to the objectives of the Savings and Investments Union, would ensue. The ESMA guidelines could help mitigate this to an extent, continuing to apply to govern the use of ESG terms in fund names. However, tensions could emerge amid a growing disconnect between the simple rules introduced by the guidelines on the one hand, and the complexity of the underlying SFDR disclosures and concepts (e.g. \u2018sustainable investment\u2019, which is integrated in the guidelines)\u00a0amid heightened post-Omnibus data availability challenges on the other.\n\n5.2.\nRepeal of the SFDR\n\nGiven the emphasis on simplification of sustainability reporting under the Omnibus, a straightforward way to simplify and reduce the sustainability-related administrative requirements for financial market participants would be to remove the rules to this effect under the SFDR altogether. If the SFDR were repealed, financial market participants would be relieved of the obligations to provide entity-level and product-level information regarding sustainability involving their practices and products. They would be free to provide this information according to parameters and templates of their choosing, based on demand from their investors, and subject to the (possible, continued) application of the ESMA fund name guidelines (which does not include reporting obligations) and other horizontal legal requirements 76 . However, for a complete answer to the problems identified in Section 2, this would need to be weighed against how well a repeal would help meet the other objectives outlined in Section 4 \u2013 e.g. to\u00a0enhance the coherence of the sustainable finance framework for the operational needs of financial market participants, as well as to improve end-investors\u2019 ability to understand and compare sustainability-linked financial products and fight greenwashing. This is assessed at the start of Section 6.\n\n5.3.\nPolicy options for alleviating burdens and costs of reporting\n\nThe first set of alternative options looks at how best to alleviate the entity-level and product-level disclosure requirements applicable to FMPs in the current framework, which constitute one of the key problems identified in section 2.1.1. The options focus on the information and datapoints that are most needed from them by end-investors and on how to clarify and simplify the concepts underlying these disclosures.\u00a0This involves amendments of the Level 1, to be complemented by corresponding Level 2 changes at a later stage. The approach to supervision would remain the same (i.e. in the hands of the national competent authorities).\n\nThe options for the disclosures in this Section are independent of those regarding categorisation in Section 5.4. However, the specific content of the product disclosures would be closely linked to the type of categories that would be created. In fact, disclosures would need to include an indication of the categories, and under some options they would also include transparency regarding the criteria.\n\n5.3.1.\nEntity-level disclosures\n\nThe suggested changes focus on the disclosures of principal adverse impacts under Article 4 SFDR, which are those most acutely identified as a problem in section 2. Disclosures on sustainability risk and remuneration policy under Article 3 and 5 77 were not identified as considerable burdens. Disclosures under Article 4 SFDR are currently mandatory for FMPs with more than 500 employees, while smaller FMPs are subject to a comply or explain mechanism.\u00a0In terms of coverage of entities, there are currently approximately 400 FMPs 78 reporting on a mandatory basis (i.e. more than 500 employees) and 1200 79 \u00a0doing so on a voluntary basis (i.e. below 500 employees) 80 .\n\n\u00a0\n\nOption 1.1: Significant reduction of entity-level disclosures\n\nUnder this option, the Commission would reduce the amount of sustainability KPIs to focus on the ones that are the most comparable, measurable and material. These would need to be built on what is understandable and important for investors (focus on retail investors) 81 ; as well as on the current market practices 82 and the future corporate reporting standards under the CSRD 83 . Work from the Platform on Sustainable Finance (PSF) 84 , the ESAs 85 , and the responses to the public consultation can inform on the usability of the indicators to be retained. The frequency of reporting could also be reduced up to 3 years instead of every year.\n\nIn addition, a revised\u00a0scope could target a meaningful scope of entities by focussing on the size of the FMPs\u2019 asset under management rather than the number of employees. Regardless of the revision of the scope, this option would involve the SFDR continuing to set entity-level disclosures for smaller FMPs that will be out of the scope of the revised CSRD, as per the Omnibus proposal.\n\nOption 1.2: Deletion of entity-level disclosures\n\nUnder this option, the SFDR would solely focus on product disclosures while the CSRD would prescribe the entity-level disclosures for FMPs in its future revised scope 86 . Assuming the adoption of the Commission\u2019s Omnibus proposals, mandatory entity-level reporting would thus no longer apply to FMPs below 1000 employees.\n\nIn contrast to option 1.1, this option fully reflects the logic of the Omnibus proposal. The CSRD will determine future entity-level sustainability-linked reporting requirements in a comprehensive, cross-sectoral and coherent way, without exceptions and without scope for additional requirements under other regulatory pieces that would risk duplications or excessive complexity. FMPs outside the CSRD scope could voluntarily report entity-level information according to the ESRS or the future voluntary sustainability-related information standard to be adopted as a delegated act according to the Omnibus proposal, and based on the voluntary standard for SMEs\u00a0(VSME) developed by EFRAG 87 .\n\n5.3.2.\nProduct-level disclosures\n\nDespite the clear need for simplification and streamlining of the current ESG disclosures for sustainable finance products, there is still a clear demand for ESG information on investment products 88 (summary of the existing consumer studies included in Annex 10). This trend was confirmed in the responses to the public consultations (described in Annex 2) which showed that 89% of respondents (272 out of 304) consider that the objective to strengthen transparency through sustainability-related disclosures for financial products is still relevant today. In addition, a Eurobarometer survey of October 2022 shows that more than six in ten Europeans find it important that their savings and investments do not find economic activities that have a negative impact on the planet. However, only 34% know whether their private savings and investments are invested into sustainable economic activities, and 29% receive information on the sustainability impact of financial products or services 89 .\n\nThis shows the need for more user-friendly information for investors to make informed choices. The two options below therefore look at how to best ensure that investors receive the information that they need while limiting the burdens on data preparers.\n\nThe specific content of product disclosures is intrinsically linked to the choice made for the categorisation system (section 5.4). Accordingly, option 2.1 would cater more for categories that rely on the existing SFDR concepts while option 2.2 would better reflect categories relying on new criteria (which would be simpler than the existing concepts).\n\nOption 2.1: Minimal changes to product-level disclosures\n\nThis option would retain the bulk of the disclosures set out in the SFDR level 2 delegated regulation in place.\n\nThe reporting templates would remain largely similar to how they are today, i.e. requiring transparency around a wide range of ESG related concepts in the current SFDR for all products in scope 90 . \u00a0Depending on the choice made regarding categories, the specific content of the disclosures would only slightly vary. If categories were introduced, disclosures would need to include a reference to the category and an explanation of the criteria, but all categorised products would continue to disclose against the wide range of ESG concepts, independently of the category under which they fall.\n\nOption 2.2: Significantly reduce product-level disclosures\n\nThis option would imply a significant change from the current approach and would result in much shorter and simpler consumer-facing disclosures (Level 2). This option would move away from relying on standardised questions for all ESG financial products but instead would be coherent with the creation of categories, with disclosures tailored to the categories under which products fall (i.e. specific disclosures would depend on whether a product is largely composed of sustainable assets, or transitioning assets, or if the product implements other ESG processes). Accordingly, detailed disclosures would be required only for categorised products and the number of data points to report would be significantly reduced from the 25 currently standardised questions 91 .\u00a0\n\nTo strike a balance between providing the necessary and relevant information for investors and reducing the burdens for FMPs, the following measures would be taken:\n\n-\nRefocussing the templates on fewer indicators and sustainability topics which are relevant for investors\u2019 decisions. A limit on the number of mandatory indicators for categorised products could also be defined (e.g. 5 indicators covering investors\u2019 interest in climate, environmental and social issues). The format of the templates would be standardised and its size (which would also include a description of the categories and its criteria) could also be limited to for example 2 pages. A shorter, standardised template focused on fewer indicators would also have the benefit of enhancing product comparability.\n\n-\nSuch disclosures should rely on clear, measurable and usable concepts rather than the currently high-level concepts which have proven complex to apply (such as sustainable investment). FMPs\u2019 experience with sustainability concepts and measures has increased significantly since the SFDR was introduced. Market observations can now inform on which indicators can be comparable across products 92 and which concepts can be properly implemented in a harmonised way. More information on how the criteria would be changed is provided under section 5.4.\n\n-\nRelying on concepts/KPIs for which information is either available from investee companies or possible to estimate by FMPs/data providers when the information is missing. Two elements should be considered:\n\no\nThe SFDR requirements should be aligned with the future corporate reporting standards under the CSRD to ensure that at least EU companies subject to these rules report the necessary information. The revised ESRS standards should be adopted in 2026.\n\no\nThe information needed to implement the SFDR should be possible to estimate when the information is not available. A market study would be conducted to understand what type of sustainability data is feasibly possible to reliably estimate\u00a0 93 .\u00a0Annex 8 includes background information on the current estimation practices. This is key to avoid that the initiative inadvertently contributes to greenwashing due to an unreliable use of estimates.\n\nTherefore, subject to the decision taken on the creation of categories under section 5.4, the disclosures could be tailored to each category and focus on: (1) compliance by the product with the criteria of the category; (2) the approach to sustainability chosen by the FMP; (3) the underlying methodology used and; (4) a requirement to disclose how the product meets a specified short set of ESG KPIs tailored to each category .\n\nAnnex 8 provides for an illustrative example of what the new template would look like. Because this option would introduce considerable changes, the proposed changes should be tested on EU investors once the above essential contours and elements are agreed by co-legislators, before being finalised in the level 2 rules.\n\n5.4.\nPolicy options for setting up a clear and coherent sustainability-linked product categorisation system\n\nTo address the problem of poor comparability of ESG products and misuse of the current Articles 8 and 9, three different options can be considered on how to set up sustainability-related categories for financial products. The options discussed in this section reflect those which emerge as the preferred ones from stakeholder feedback, namely different combinations of distinct categories for \u2018sustainable\u2019, \u2018transition\u2019, and \u2018other ESG\u2019 products 94 . Option 3.1 would set 3 new categories\u00a0(sustainable, transition, other ESG),\u00a0option 3.2 would set 2 new categories (sustainable, transition), and option 3.3 would convert the existing disclosure Articles 8 and 9 into formal categories (sustainable and other ESG).\u00a0Based on this stakeholder feedback, other options to either not create categories at all, or to create more than two or three categories are dismissed at the outset\u00a0(as explained in section 5.5), also given that such approaches are assessed to be suboptimal in meeting the objectives defined in section 4.\n\nLike the current use of the SFDR as a categorisation system, these categories would be voluntary. As explained at the start of section 5 95 , in line with the principle of proportionality, the categorisation caters for FMPs which are committed to offering sustainability-linked financial products and for their clients which are interested in investing in them. However, some of the policy options presented limit the ability of non-categorised products to make ESG claims in marketing documentations and names. Also, the specific content of the disclosures builds on the information provided in Option 2.2 and would be largely defined by the type of category chosen and their underlying criteria.\n\nUnder the three options, the categories would be designed in a way that is easily understandable by retail investors and usable by distributors\u00a0by (1) relying on terms that are understandable to non-experts; (2) reflecting different levels of ambitions/type of sustainability objectives that can easily be explained. The categories would not regulate every feature of products which would fall within them, but rather create certain high level requirements which categorised products would have to meet. They would aim at enabling investors and advisors to easily identify the products that can match certain sustainability preferences, supported by short mandatory disclosures (as per option 2.2 above). This implies that the names of the categories, as well as a short explanation of what the categories are (part of the product disclosures), must be enough for investors to get a clear idea of the (minimum) ESG standards followed by categorised products 96 . In contrast to today, where products can fall under either Article 8 or 9 depending on how FMPs decide to implement the SFDR concepts 97 , the categories would cluster products into distinct groups based on their main claims (\u2018sustainable\u2019, \u2018transition\u2019, \u2018other ESG\u2019) and how they meet clear predefined criteria.\n\nThere is of course a trade-off between making the categories simple for FMPs and investors on the one hand, and heightened concerns of greenwashing on the other. To achieve the former, the categories should rely on a few key datapoints to cluster products and convey their main ESG features. However, there is a risk that this effort to simplify the framework will not rely on the right data, that is both available and of most interest to investors, or will omit some important environmental or social decision-useful data. In assessing the impacts, it should therefore be ensured that the data that is relied on for the categories is both available to a large degree, possible to estimate without excessive effort in case it cannot be derived directly from investees, and is proven to be the most decision-useful for investors, based on their preferences when investing in sustainability-related financial products. The descriptions of the options in this section and the analysis of section 6.3 (and Annex 8) weigh the impacts in terms of the balance between the expected benefits on the one hand and the costs/risks on the other. The analysis reflects how to best ensure the criteria for the categories support the objectives of the review in section 4 and strike a balance in terms of e.g. competitiveness and simplification objectives, ESG ambition, and issues of data availability and usefulness for investors.\u00a0\n\nThe approach to supervision would remain the same, i.e. NCAs would remain in charge of supervising the disclosures and would check whether categorised products comply with the underlying criteria of the categories. The ESAs would continue to have a coordinating role and would be in charge of harmonising the supervisory practices/expectations of NCAs to avoid diverging rules or gold plating as much as possible.\n\nDescription of the three options\n\n\u00d8\nOptions 3.1 and 3.2\n\nOption 3.1 and 3.2 both suggest creating categories which would rely on detailed criteria that are different from the current broader disclosure sustainability concepts of Article 8 and Article 9. These new categories would build on existing criteria under the ESMA Guidelines for funds names and current market practices. They would therefore reflect what FMPs have already adapted to and would be simpler, clearer and less data intensive than the current concepts of the SFDR (more details in box 3 below). The only difference between these two options is the number of categories, and therefore the potential coverage of the categorisation system. Both options are based on a voluntary regime, meaning that it applies only in case of explicit decisions by FMPs to offer sustainable, transition (and other ESG) products and by investors to seek and select them. There are restrictions however for products that are outside the categories on how they can be marketed to retail investors or use any relevant terms in the names.\n\nOption 3.1: Three new categories \u2013 sustainable, transition, other ESG\n\nTo bring clarity to end investors as to which products have a level of sustainability-related ambition which would match their sustainability preferences, this option would establish three categories focusing on commonly encountered ESG/sustainability-related investment features and preferences from consumers (see Annex 10). These would be:\n\n-\n\u2018Sustainable\u2019 category: investments that contribute to sustainability goals (such as climate, environment, or social goals) such as investments in companies or projects that are already largely sustainable meeting specific sustainability standards.\n\n-\n\u2018Transition\u2019 category: investments in companies and/or projects which are not sustainable yet, but are on a credible transition path, or investments that contribute to transition goals (such as climate, environment or social goals).\n\n-\n\u2018Other ESG\u2019 category: investments which do not meet the criteria of the sustainable or transition investment categories but however apply credible environmental or social investment approaches (e.g.\u00a0process-based strategies, such as the use of ESG ratings or outperforming the investment universe on a specific ESG indicator). Minimum safeguards would also apply to this third category.\n\nSpecial considerations for the transition category\n\nIn contrast to the \u2018sustainable\u2019 and \u2018other ESG\u2019 categories, which would build on the approaches of Articles 9 and 8 of the current SFDR, an official \u2018transition\u2019 category would finally clarify the distinct characteristics of this type of strategies. 98 The concepts and criteria that would underpin this category would reflect current market practices and build on the existing legislative framework for transition products (ESMA guidelines), including existing practices on national supervision of transition plans. This category would not create a parallel definition of transition but would align with criteria developed under the Commission 2023 Recommendation on transition finance 99 and the criteria already mandatory for funds using transition-related terms in their names under the ESMA guidelines 100 . The criteria would also ensure coherence with the EU Climate Benchmarks and potential future regulatory development (e.g. CSRD and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive) and would aim at striking a balance to ensure sufficient ambition and comparability on the one hand, as well as inclusiveness and flexibility on the other, allowing funding to flow to a transitioning real economy.\n\nThe evaluation annex highlights the challenges arising from the lack of recognition of transition finance under the SFDR despite the existence of many products with transition objectives disclosing under Article 8 and 9. This creates challenges for FMPs wanting to pursue a transition strategy while having to comply with the SFDR underlying concepts\u00a0 101 , hindering the possibility to conduct and disclose diverse transition-related investment strategies. This leads to confusion and lack of appropriate disclosures for investors interested in investing in products with transitional objectives. The consultation confirmed a large degree of support (72% of respondents) for creating a specific category for transition products, including as an inclusive strategy to focus on efforts to improve companies\u2019 performance regardless of their starting points and to help operationalise the concept of \u2018transition finance\u2019, developed under the Commission 2023 Recommendation on transition finance.\n\nPotential role for the categories:\u00a0Option 3.1 would create a categorisation system that could potentially scope-in a large majority of ESG financial products (due to the third category). Due to this large scope, the categories would play an important role in limiting which products are allowed to make ESG claims in their marketing documentation and in their names. For example, only categorised products could be allowed to use ESG related terms in their names and add ESG elements in their marketing documentations. Categories could also determine which SFDR products could be distributed to retail investors with sustainability preferences aligned with the categories\u2019 criteria (under MiFID and IDD). The third category would ensure that all products making ESG claims (marketing documentations, names, or be distributed as products with ESG features) are regulated and comply with minimum safeguards 102 .\n\nOption 3.2: Two new categories \u2013 sustainable, transition\n\nThis option would be the same as option 3.1, but without a third category. Option 3.2 would set up two categories: \u2018sustainable\u2019 category and \u2018transition\u2019 category. These categories would be the same as the ones suggested under option 3.1.\n\nPotential role for the categories: Option 3.2 would create a narrower categorisation system that would only cover the most ambitious ESG products 103 . Instead of dividing the market of ESG products into three clear clusters and ensuring common criteria for all ESG products, the categories would bring visibility to the most ambitious ESG products. Due to the narrow scope, it would not be feasible to link the categories to the marketing communications, naming and distribution rules to the same extent as under option 3.1 (not enough products would be covered). Uncategorised products making ESG claims in marketing communications and names would therefore continue to exist and be available to investors.\n\nElements to be defined at level 1 vs elements to be defined at level 2\n\nThe below describes the general division between level 1 and level 2, and box 3 below provides concrete examples of what specific elements would be defined at level 1 and at level 2.\n\nUnlike the current SFDR level 1 text, which has allowed for unduly complex and disproportionate rules in the level 2 104 , the revised level 1 text would concretely define the categories and their delineation\u00a0by setting their essential features, i.e. main elements of the criteria, administrative procedures and supervisory framework. These include for example the key principles and requirements both for the positive criteria (sustainability objective measured by credible indicators and covering a mandatory threshold of the product) and the negative criteria (list of exclusions). The below section provides for a detailed description of the essential features of the categories (see also box 3 and annex 8).\n\nAlready setting these elements at the level 1 allows for the assessment of the categories\u2019 scope and impact against the objectives identified in Section 4 in terms of their effectiveness, efficiency and coherence. Building on these, section 6 analyses the categories\u2019 potential to simplify the implementation of the SFDR and reduce the costs for FMPs as well as to increase investors\u2019 protection and enhance the comparability of ESG products.\n\nThe level 1 text will set out an empowerment for the Commission to develop a limited set of level 2 implementing rules to supplement these key elements with more technical requirements linked to the criteria. For example, level 2 rules could involve setting specific KPIs for measuring and comparing the positive contributions of different types of products depending on the ESG objective (see box 3 below), specifying how the contribution of various assets/investees are to be calculated for meeting the positive criteria 105 , and any permitted deviations from the exclusions at portfolio level e.g. for hedging purposes 106 , as well as setting the names of the categories following market testing. The level 1 will impose strict limits on the future level 2 to ensure proportionality between ESG and non-ESG products to avoid disincentivising FMPs from offering the former.\n\nSimilarly to the disclosures, defining well-specified technical elements at the level 2 would allow for:\n\n-\nConducting additional market studies ensuring that the final technical requirements linked to the categories (criteria and disclosures) are usable by FMPs. This should be done after the essential contours and elements of the categories are agreed by co-legislators. Such market studies could be conducted by the ESAs and should test the criteria on the existing ESG market to ensure that the categories would capture a sufficient portion of the existing market and confirm that they rely on reliable and available ESG information. For example, criteria would not rely on indicators for which the information is neither available from companies (public reporting) nor possible to estimate. More information on the criteria and the estimation considerations/practices is in box 3 and Annex 8. Conducting regular market studies will also have the benefit of monitoring how the framework is evolving, also in light of market innovation, development of new products and data, and changes in investors\u2019 preferences, and ensure comparability is maintained over time.\n\n-\nConducting additional consumer testing studies ensuring that the names of the categories are understood by retail investors in all EU languages. The existing consumer studies (described in annex 10) and engagement activities (described in annex 2) already identified certain sustainability topics and information that are deemed important by EU investors and confirmed the need to establish EU categories. However, there has not yet been an EU-wide consumer study looking at how to name such categories for them to be easily understandable in different EU languages and to convey the correct message to EU retail investors. Once their essential contours and elements are agreed by co-legislators, the names of the categories would need to be tested in all EU countries, which could be done by the ESAs, with the help of NCAs. Setting the name after the political decision on the categories\u2019 main features would allow the Commission to reflect any changes from the co-decision process, ensuring form follows function, and avoiding pre-establishing category-names which, in the end, could be at odds with the key features of the categories and mislead investors. It would also be important to ensure the names are coherent with other EU policy measures 107 . The names used for the categories throughout this document are thus only indicative.\n\n-\nAligning with the future EU corporate reporting under the CSRD, which will be revised once the Omnibus proposal will be adopted (indicative timing: 2026). This will ensure coherence in the data provided under ESRS and the indicators and disclosures under the future SFDR level 2.\n\nIn addition, the date of effect of new level 1 rules would be sufficiently deferred to make sure that they enter into application together with level 2, after a sufficient implementation period. At this stage it is too early to anticipate details on the content of the level 2 measures, as they will be impacted by the negotiations with the co-legislators. However, they will be subject to considerations on the cost-benefit analysis and follow the better regulation guidelines. \u00a0\n\nDescription of the proposed criteria under options 3.1 and 3.2 (to be read in conjunction with box 3 below and Annex 8)\n\nThe central SFDR concept, i.e. the \u2018sustainable investment\u2019 definition in Article 2(17), builds on three principles: (1) contributing to an environmental or social objective; (2) causing no significant harm to other environmental and social objectives (based on the consideration of principal adverse impacts), and (3) investing in companies with good governance practices. The revised criteria would retain the concept and build on this while improving these core principles by underpinning them with a set of clear minimum requirements.\n\nThe evaluation (annex 11) and problem definition (section 2) has identified the lack of clarity linked to the concept of \u2018sustainable investment\u2019, which has led to widely different interpretations and implementation approaches amongst FMPs. As shown in box 10 of annex 11, the exposure to sustainable investments of products tracking a similar benchmark can range from 1% to 80%.\n\nThe evaluation also finds that the \u2018DNSH test\u2019, which is done through the high-level principle of \u2018consideration of principal adverse impacts\u2019, has not led to harmonised implementation practices and has not prevented harmful investments. This is mainly because the current SFDR leaves considerable discretion to FMPs in choosing how they consider these impacts.\n\nTo remedy this, two criteria for ESG categories are suggested:\n\n\u00d8\nPositive contribution: Setting a minimum portion of investment to contribute to the sustainability objective (70/80% of the product) 108 \u2013\n\n\u00d8\nExclusions: Setting clear exclusions of harmful industries and activities in which products cannot invest in \u2013 these exclusions would be aligned with the ones of the EU Climate Benchmarks, as introduced by the ESMA guidelines on funds\u2019 names\n\nThe changes would aim at simplifying the current framework and:\n\n\u00d8\nFormalise the categorisation of products and clearly delineate between the different categories, bringing legal clarity to both FMPs and end-investors.\n\n\u00d8\nIntroduce some common elements to underpin FMPs\u2019 diverse approaches for ESG products, based on data that is available, measurable and possible to estimate, and minimising fragmentation in supervisory practices amongst NCAs.\n\n\u00d8\nProtect end-investors against misleading claims and increasing the comparability of ESG products.\n\nThe main positive impacts of the suggested criteria compared to today\u2019s situation are described in table 1 of annex 8.\n\nHigh level principles to be reflected in the criteria:\n\nTo deliver against the specific objectives of the review, the criteria should reflect the following principles:\n\n\u00d8\nFirst, the criteria should draw on reliable and comparable sustainability information and take account of the data availability considerations outlined above 109 . The criteria should be designed in a way to mitigate as much as possible the data availability issues and the related greenwashing risks.\u00a0This can be done by focusing the concepts on information that is available from investee companies in scope of the CSRD (i.e. aligning with the upcoming streamlined ESRS), on information included in widely used or endorsed international frameworks such as the ISSB and the GRI, other emerging voluntary sustainability-related information standards such as the one to be adopted as a delegated act according to the Omnibus proposal, and based on the voluntary standard for SMEs (VSME) developed by EFRAG 110 , and information that is possible to estimate (see below the special considerations for estimates).\n\n\u00d8\nSecond, the criteria should take into account existing market practices to ensure continuity (especially regarding the criteria introduced by ESMA guidelines on funds\u2019 names). This would allow to lower the one-off implementation costs and ensure regulatory stability 111 .\u00a0\n\n\u00d8\nThird, the criteria should ensure sufficiently high environmental/sustainability ambition, and focus on information shown to be most useful to investors, in order to meet their expectations, mitigate greenwashing risks and respect the precautionary principle. At the same time, the criteria should be achievable by a reasonable portion of current products making quality ESG claims to make sure that the categories do not unduly disrupt practices as explained above 112 .\n\n\u00d8\nFinally, the criteria would need to enhance the comparability\u00a0of products and bring sufficient legal clarity in order to harmonise implementation and supervisory practices to the extent possible. At the same time, the criteria would also need to allow for sufficient flexibility for FMPs to fit diverse investment strategies and asset classes (e.g. equities, bonds, indices, etc.).\n\nBox 3: Description of the proposed criteria under option 3.1 and 3.2 (see Annex 8 for more information)\n\nDescription of main elements of the criteria and their benefits (see Annex 8 for more information)\n\n(1)\nPositive contribution \u2013 setting a minimum portion of investment to the contribution leg of the current definition to boost comparability:\n\nStarting from the assumption that the categories are voluntary, FMPs would still be free to choose their own sustainability objective(s) and how they plan to achieve them (subject to proper transparency). However, aligned with the ESMA guidelines on fund names, a certain percentage of the product\u2019s portfolio would need to\u00a0follow an ESG strategy that matches the ESG claims they make 113 . Products falling under the sustainable and transition categories would need to show how a specific percentage of their investments contribute to a clear sustainability objective and explain how they measure that. Products falling under the \u2018other ESG\u2019 category would need to demonstrate that a specific percentage of their portfolio aligns with the chosen ESG claims or processes.\n\nIn addition, the assessment of performance against the objective should be monitored and disclosed and should be based on credible and where possible science-based indicators chosen by the FMPs. The SFDR (level 2) could provide a non-exhaustive list of ESG indicators on certain sustainability topics for FMPs\u2019 use 114 .\n\n(2)\nExclusions \u2013 a negative screening test replacing the DNSH and good governance legs in the current sustainable investment definition.\n\nThis\u00a0would take the form of a clear list of industries or activities that products should not be able to invest in (e.g. based on the ESMA guidelines and reflecting a wide consensus of harmful industries or those with high carbon footprints) 115 . Such exclusions would make rules more consistent across the EU, harmonise the NCAs\u2019 supervisory expectations and enhance comparability between products. Also, by focusing on fewer sustainability topics than the current do no significant harm provision, this approach would reduce the amount of data that FMPs need to collect. Given these new minimum safeguards would not cover all the ESG aspects previously covered by the PAIs (e.g. biodiversity and water), FMPs could continue to identify and consider material negative outcomes on these topics on a best-efforts basis. As data availability develops around e.g. water, biodiversity, circular economy etc, the scope of the exclusions could also be reviewed.\n\n\n\n\nConcretely, this could translate into the following criteria (illustrative purposes only):\n\n-\nSustainable category: (1) exclusion of investments into companies excluded from the EU Paris-Aligned Benchmarks (PAB) 116 ; (2) 70/80% of the portfolio to align with the strategy of the product for positive contribution to sustainability. The assessment of performance against the objective should be monitored and disclosed and should be based on credible and where possible science-based indicators chosen by the FMPs. The SFDR (level 2) could provide a non-exhaustive list of ESG indicators on certain sustainability topics for FMPs\u2019 use. For example, investments in a certain amount of Taxonomy-aligned activities could be one possible way to demonstrate contribution to climate and environmental objectives.\n\n-\nTransition category: (1) exclusion of companies excluded from the EU Climate Transition Benchmarks (CTB) 117 ; (2) 70/80% of the portfolio to align with the strategy of the product to demonstrate positive contribution to transition or be covered by a portfolio level strategy (e.g. relative/absolute GHG emission reduction of the portfolio per year). The assessment of performance against the objective should be monitored and disclosed and should be based on credible and where possible science-based indicators chosen by the FMPs. The FMP could use the following non exhaustive approaches for measuring the performance of the product\u00a0: (a) investments in undertakings or economic activities with a credible transition plan at the level of the undertaking or activity, including science-based targets; (b) investments in portfolios tracking EU climate transition benchmarks (PAB/CTB); (c) engagement with investee companies demonstrating measurable change; and (d) investment in Taxonomy-eligible economic activities becoming Taxonomy-aligned 118 and partially aligned Taxonomy assets 119 . The level 2 could specify limited details of how to measure performance in relation to the indicators.\n\n-\nOther ESG category: (1) the same CTB exclusions as for the transition category above; (2) 70/80% of the portfolio to align with the overall strategy. The assessment of performance against the objective should be monitored and disclosed based on relevant indicators chosen by the FMPs. The level 2 could set out voluntary indicators based on further market study.\n\nHow these criteria could be spelled out in Level 1 and Level 2 (illustrative purposes only):\n\nLevel 1 \u2013 (1) list of exclusions per category, (2) 70/80% requirement for the investments to support the positive contribution objective and strategy of the product, (3) non-exhaustive list of approaches for measuring performance in relation to the objective and strategy depending on the category.\n\nLevel 2 \u2013 (1) names of categories, (2) possible common indicators to assess and monitor the performance against the objective for voluntary use by FMPs (based on available and reliable ESG data), and (3) short disclosure templates per category 120 .\n\nHow these criteria would help achieve the specific objectives of enhancing comparability and reducing the burdens for FMPs\n\nThe main impacts of the suggested criteria (compared to today\u2019s situation) are described in table 1 of annex 8.\n\nImpacts of the exclusions:\n\n-\nEnhancing comparability of financial products: Such exclusions would make rules more consistent across the EU, harmonise the NCAs\u2019 supervisory expectations about what categorised products cannot invest in, and therefore enhance the comparability between such products, in line with investors\u2019 broadly signalled preferences regarding which sectors should be excluded (Annex 10).\n\n-\nLimiting implementation costs and aligning with existing market practices: First, these exclusions have already been introduced under the ESMA guidelines for ESG funds names, which started applying in May 2025. The number of funds currently applying these requirements has been estimated at 4.570. Second, market analyses 121 show that the implementation of sectoral exclusions are the key elements of comparability identified in funds with ESG characteristics or objectives, demonstrating the well-established market practices around exclusions. Finally, market studies have showed that estimation practices on PAB exclusions are very well developed 122 \u00a0which minimises costs for FMPs and the divergent approaches across data vendors in estimating PAB exclusions.\n\n-\nUsability challenges: certain usability challenges are noted with specific data points among the exclusions and how they are used in particular regarding whether violations of UN Global Compact (UN GC) principles or the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises are \u2018reported\u2019 or \u2018committed\u2019. It is also unclear when a company is no longer considered in violation if it happened a long time ago. The future regime should cater for bringing clarity in this regard in level 2.\u00a0\n\nImpacts of the positive criteria:\n\n-\nEnhancing comparability of financial products: The levels of sustainable investment would be harmonised across all categorised products, ensuring common levels of contribution. In addition, the reinforced transparency around the measurement of the performance would allow investors to get more granular information on the type of contribution. Finally, setting voluntary common indicators for the measurement (at level 2) could boost the comparability of the disclosures on contribution.\n\n-\nLimiting implementation costs and aligning with existing market practices: Like the exclusions, a 80% threshold for contribution has already been established by the ESMA guidelines for ESG funds names. In addition, FMPs would remain free to set their own objectives, therefore choosing the sustainability topics for which they believe they can access comparable data from their underlying investments.\n\nPractical limitations to reach perfect comparability on contribution (positive criteria)\n\nThere are certain practical limitations to the levels of comparability which can be reached/required from products. Findings from the evaluation 123 show that there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 on how to granularly define what a positive contribution to a sustainability objective should be. This is mainly due to the wide variety of assets, strategies, sustainability objectives that exists in the current market. If a very granular and common (mandatory) approach to contribution was to be applied to all products regardless of their sustainability objective (e.g. minimum alignment with the EU Taxonomy), the investment universe would be too restricted, and the categories would not be usable (i.e. only a handful of products could be categorised). Further, this would not align with the specific and general objectives of this initiative 124 .\n\nIn fact, the potential of categories to simplify the framework for FMPs and to enhance the comparability of products and fight greenwashing would be significantly lowered if they left most prospective ESG products out of scope and only a handful of EU products are categorised. Therefore, the suggested criteria focus on ensuring harmonised levels of contribution, to be defined by FMPs, rather than granularly defining the nature of the contribution for them. This would also ensure continuity with what investment funds had to implement under the ESMA guidelines on funds\u2019 names (in application since May 2025).\n\nPossible additional measures which could be explored\n\nIn addition to the measures described above, the Commission could be empowered to define a minimum ESG performance for certain sustainability objectives. In order to set this comparable minimum quantitative criterion on performance, two elements would be needed: (1) widely available data from underlying investments or otherwise estimable datapoints; (2) a politically agreed science-based target (e.g. minimum performance on GHG emissions for climate-related objectives) so that the law can set that minimum threshold unequivocally.\n\nAdditional considerations linked to estimations\n\nDue to data availability issues the use of estimates will be inevitable and is already part of current market practices given that the investable universe for financial products always extended beyond listed and larger EU companies, including non-EU companies and assets that are not covered by EU reporting rules 125 .\n\nThe evaluation (Annex 11) identified two shortcomings linked to estimations in the SFDR implementation: (1) the use of estimates is currently unregulated and lacks harmonised guidance; (2) the data required is sometimes not possible to estimate when not disclosed by the company (either due to the nature of the topic/indicator, e.g. board composition, or due to usability issues linked to the specific definition, e.g. emissions to water 126 . These limitations led to greenwashing concerns and lack of legal clarity for FMPs. In contrast, the proposed criteria and exclusions are based on existing market practices, would acknowledge the continued use of estimates, build on findings from market analysis on which indicators are mostly disclosed by companies and of interest to investors, and rely on common metrics which are possible to estimate in a harmonised way. On the other hand, the evaluation does not strongly identify the lack of regulation of data providers themselves as a major shortcoming, nor one which would cohere with the objectives of the targeted review of the SFDR (including in the context of overall simplification 127 ).\n\nThe level 1 should thus allow the use of estimates and introduce principles and guidance for this purpose, to mitigate greenwashing concerns and provide certainty for FMPs. Examples of such principles and guidance are provided in Annex 8. Once agreed by co-legislators, together with the main elements and requirements linked to the categories and criteria, the ESAs could be tasked to test and confirm what type of sustainability data is feasible to reliably obtain and estimate (see above \u2018Elements to be defined at level 1 vs elements to be defined at level 2\u2019) 128 .\n\n\u00d8\nOption 3.3: Converting Article 8 and 9 into categories \u2013 sustainable, other ESG\n\nAs an alternative to options 1 and 2, this option would involve a less far-reaching amendment of the SFDR by transforming\u00a0Article 8 into an \u2018other ESG\u2019 category and Article 9 into a \u2018sustainable\u2019 category. There would therefore be no standalone category for transition finance products. Given the option would seek to make minimal changes, the underlying requirements and concepts would remain largely like the ones of the current Article 8 and 9 (with some possible targeted amendments to improve their clarify and usability).\n\nThis option would largely affirm the current market practice of treating these two Articles as de facto categories, underpinned by current sustainability concepts (e.g. sustainable investment, DNSH, promotion of environmental and social characteristics etc.). Crucially, there would be no sectoral exclusions like in options 3.1 and 3.2, notably for the \u2018other ESG\u2019 category.\n\nPotential role for the categories: Option 3.3 would create a categorisation system that could play a similar role as the one under option 3.1. The difference would be the absence of recognition for transition finance products and the limited changes in the current unclear underlying requirements.\n\n5.5.\nOptions discarded at an early stage\n\nNon-regulatory measures. Further guidance and other soft tools e.g. Q&As are considered insufficient to effectively address the problems identified in section 2, to comprehensively meet the objectives specified in section 4.2 and to respond to stakeholder feedback calling for the creation of clear product categories. Rather, the risks noted in sections 3.1 and 5.1 with the baseline scenario would likely increase (emergence of new national measures to tackle the problems, further fragmentation etc). In this context, effectively prolonging the status quo yet attempting to introduce further guidance to address the identified problems, as well as new ones emerging from the implementation of the Omnibus, would add to the extensive Level 3 guidance already in place. Some guidance could be effectively impossible to provide, in case of new inconsistencies or contradictions between the SFDR and revised CSRD/Taxonomy. As mentioned in section 5.1, the ESMA guidelines could help to an extent in governing the use of ESG terms in fund names and\u00a0providing stability and continuity to markets. However, tensions could emerge between the (simple, but non-binding and non-comprehensive) guidelines and further additional complexities\u00a0in underlying SFDR disclosures, going against better regulation principles of ensuring coherence between different policy instruments 129 . This could add to further confusion and compromise any anticipated benefits in terms of meeting the objectives in section 4.2 (i.e. simplify and improve the coherence of the framework for financial market participants as well as improve end-investors\u2019 ability to understand and compare ESG products). It could also generate disengagement among some FMPs, who could potentially withdraw from offering sustainability-linked products.\n\nNo category. Proposing that ESG financial products should not be categorised at all could be seen as a simplification on paper, and in some ways a coherent step following the Omnibus. An argument could be made that less ESG data from investees means less scope for creating a meaningful product categorisation under SFDR. However, this conflates the objectives of the Omnibus on the one hand (simplifying excessive sustainability reporting requirements for corporates) and the SFDR on the other (meeting investors\u2019 demand for ESG information regarding financial products), effectively denying the validity of the latter in a post-Omnibus scenario. As explained previously, ESG data for financial products was never only to be derived from (pre-Omnibus) European corporate disclosures. Moreover, the demand among EU investors for ESG information regarding financial products remains strong 130 . Thus, creating categories is arguably a necessary and coherent step following the Omnibus, to convey a high-level message of products\u2019 key features according to a simpler set of key measurable parameters, to compensate for a decrease in detailed constituent ESG data from investees. Providing for no category would also represent a departure from (i) the revealed preference of markets today (in the treatment of Articles 8 and 9 as de facto categories) to distinguish between ESG products, (ii) the preferences expressed by a wide range of stakeholders in the consultation to introduce a proper, clear(er) categorisation 131 , and (iii) the changes which markets have adopted in applying the ESMA fund name guidelines. It would effectively amount to removing any distinction between ESG products (implying amendments to Articles 8 and 9), constitute a major change, and would thus be contrary to the aim of not forcing undue changes on markets which have adapted to the current rules 132 . It could also necessitate yet more extensive ESG disclosures to distinguish between products and to compensate for the lack of a high-level clustering of products according to their key objectives and features. The option is thus dismissed from the outset as an effective, efficient and coherent way of meeting the objectives in section 4.2 (i.e. simplify and improve the coherence of the framework for financial market participants as well as improve end-investors\u2019 ability to understand and compare ESG products).\n\nOne category. Alternatively, creating a single category for all products making ESG claims would also represent a further complication and reordering of the market for FMPs and less clarity for investors. To accommodate all potential products, it would run the risk of having to rely on new (broad) concepts, with potentially heavily watered-down criteria and safeguards. As above, the changes from the Omnibus do not in themselves annul investors\u2019 continued interest in receiving more comparable information on the different ESG features of products. Product disclosures could also potentially need to increase to cater for this. Legal certainty would be unlikely to improve, with continued need for further guidance, going against the aim of simplifying and improving the coherence of the framework for financial market participants. Transparency for investors and the quality of products on offer would likely suffer, impairing end-investors\u2019 ability to understand and compare ESG products.\n\nMore than three categories. Finally, going beyond three categories could also entail an unduly significant \u2013 and unnecessary \u2013 reorganisation of the market for FMPs, of questionable added-value for investors. As the number of categories increases, the criteria needed to distinguish between them could become excessively intricate, adding further complexity in a way that would be incongruent with the Omnibus and the added data challenges it brings. There could be a risk that only a few products would ever populate a given category. The Platform proposals confirm the broad stakeholder feedback in favour of a more limited number of categories and find that this would achieve a balance in terms of capturing different products within simple, high-level categories, while allowing for product innovation and diversity targeting different investment strategies and asset classes, as well as ensuring sufficient investor protection 133 . The additional intricacies and drawbacks associated with going beyond three categories are thus considered suboptimal in meeting the objectives of simplification and usability for end-investors.\n\n6.\nWHAT ARE THE IMPACTS OF THE POLICY OPTIONS AND HOW DO THEY COMPARE?\n\n6.1.\nOption 0: Repeal of the SFDR 134\n\nv\nExpected benefits and potential drawbacks for data preparers (FMPs)\n\nThis option would effectively remove the implementation costs associated with the SFDR by deleting all entity-level and product-level disclosures. FMPs would be free to choose what ESG-related disclosures, if any,\u00a0to make to investors and the wider market. There would be no mandatory sustainability-linked product disclosures (those for in-scope companies, including financial entities, would continue under the post-omnibus CSRD) and the field would become unregulated, apart from the use of names as per the ESMA fund name guidelines which only cover a limited number of products 135 (unless these were repealed by ESMA as well \u2013 see below under \u2018coherence\u2019) and other horizontal rules governing environmental claims 136 .\n\nThe main drawback would be that the investments made, and client-bases established, under the SFDR would be cast into doubt. FMPs would no longer have a common regulatory framework for sustainability-linked claims involving financial products. FMPs that have built a competitive position out of ESG-investing and the implementation of the SFDR would face a degree of commercial uncertainty.\n\nv\nExpected benefits and potential drawbacks for data users (mainly investors and supervisors)\n\nRepealing the SFDR would remove the existing ESG transparency for financial products required under SFDR and would leave markets to design the scope and details of ESG-information involving financial products. Some market-based solutions could potentially constitute viable alternatives to corresponding SFDR provisions, but without certainty that these would happen. Repealing would also go against the current demand for ESG information, as described in section 5.3.2 and elaborated in Annex 10.\n\nThe drawback would be that it would create a regulatory void in terms of the availability of structured ESG information regarding financial products. Distributors and investors would no longer have a common regulatory framework for this purpose. If only the ESMA guidelines remained, there would be a significant unlevel playing field across financial products given the limited, and non-binding scope, of such guidelines, to the detriment of investor protection. Product comparability beyond the name would deteriorate and search costs involving more in-depth features of financial products for investors with sustainability preferences would increase. Apart from the name, these investors would need to make sense of other ESG claims made by products themselves. These claims, such as claims in marketing documentations, would be unregulated, raising risks of greenwashing.\u00a0The Directive on unfair commercial practices, including the recent amendments and Commission guidance 137 , would remain applicable horizontally to all business-to-consumers transactions, but repealing the SFDR would not be coherent with its recognition that financial services warrant specific regulation (Article 3.9; 3.4), given higher levels of information asymmetry between financial market participants and investors 138 . FMPs could choose different ways of showcasing their ESG claims as there would be no common framework requiring FMPs to provide any information, and in a structured manner (i.e. against common criteria) 139 .\u00a0\n\nOverall assessment: effectiveness, efficiency and coherence\n\nEffectiveness in addressing the specific problems\n\nThis option partly addresses the difficulties faced by FMPs in coping with the lengthy requirements and the costs associated with the lack of publicly available ESG data (problem drivers 1 and 3). It would primarily serve the specific objective of simplifying and reducing administrative burdens. However, the effects would be negative regarding the objectives of ensuring overall coherence with the rest of the sustainable finance framework (see below) and improving end-investors\u2019 ability to understand and compare ESG products. Horizontally applicable consumer protection rules traditionally rely on specific provisions in financial services to ensure investor protection and would be highly unlikely to function effectively to serve this purpose.\n\nEfficiency (costs)\n\nThis option would cancel out the costs associated with the SFDR compared to the baseline scenario, estimated to represent an annual total of EUR 246 million in recurring costs (see Annex 3, section 3.10), but investments in commercial opportunities pursued through SFDR compliance would be subject to new uncertainty.\n\nCoherence\n\nA repeal would mean that the field for sustainability-linked disclosures by FMPs would become unregulated, apart from the use of names as per the ESMA fund name guidelines. These have become, after some initial pushback 140 , a broadly accepted and useful source of clarity for FMPs and investors. Indeed, the options further below build on key elements of the guidelines to help achieve some of the objectives above. However, in a scenario in which the SFDR were repealed, there would be some drawbacks in relying on the guidelines alone (in conjunction with horizontal consumer protection rules) to govern, and sustain, the EU single market for sustainability-linked financial products. For one, the guidelines do not apply to all products under the scope of the SFDR, namely pensions and insurance products, for which FMPs signal a continued preference to be covered under common EU rules. Second, they do not constitute strict legal requirements 141 , and inform only the use of ESG terms in fund names, not touching upon other disclosures made to investors under the SFDR. \u00a0\n\nNational solutions might emerge to address the resulting information gaps and risks, which could fragment the single market (and thereby revive one of the original problem drivers behind the creation of the SFDR in the first place 142 ) and go against overarching objectives under the Savings and Investments Union. Tensions between potential measures in national law could emerge with the ESMA guidelines, which might even force them to be withdrawn, denying the single market of any common EU rulebook in the area.\n\nRegarding coherence with the Omnibus, as mentioned above under the discarded \u2018no category\u2019 option, the argument that the Omnibus revokes the need for the SFDR does not stand up. For one, stakeholders are not requesting it 143 . In fact, the Omnibus invokes the need for a coherent and commensurate revision of the SFDR, both to ensure consistency in the ESG data requirements between the various parts of the overall framework, as well as to allow for better serving the needs of end-investors through shorter and more focused ESG information, something which product categories could better convey (see section 6.3). 144 \u00a0\n\nFinally, without commensurate changes in other linked parts of the sustainable finance framework, a repeal of the SFDR would render some provisions in these other areas meaningless (e.g. links to SFDR-specific terms in sustainability preferences under MiFID/IDD or in the consideration of sustainability risks and factors under UCITS/AIFMD).\n\nTherefore, a repeal of the SFDR would not be a coherent step in light of the results of the evaluation which shows, at once, continued wide support for its objectives and a clear need to overhaul its technical concepts and requirements, which have led to the problems in Section 2. Nor would it be coherent and consistent with the President\u2019s mission letter to Commissioner Albuquerque calling to explore ways to \u201cscale up sustainable finance, in particular transition finance and climate resilience (\u2026), to promote the development and transparent categorisation of financial products and services with sustainability features (\u2026 and) to ensure the EU remains a global\u00a0leader in sustainable finance\u201d. 145\n\n6.2.\nMeasures for alleviating burdens and costs of reporting\n\n6.2.1.\nChanges to entity-level disclosures\n\nOption 1.1: significant reduction of principal adverse impact disclosures at entity-level\n\nv\nExpected benefits and potential drawbacks for data preparers (FMPs)\n\n\n\n\nSignificantly reducing the entity-level disclosures for FMPs and advisers, as outlined in option 1.1, would lower the costs imposed by the current disclosures. As set out in Article 6(1) of the SFDR Delegated Regulation, all indicators in Table 1 of Annex I, and at least two additional ones, one from table 2 and one from table 3, must be filled out in each PAI statement when an FMP is either required (mandatory) to prepare a PAI statement or if the FMP decides (voluntarily) to prepare a PAI statement. This amounts to 16 indicators. These disclosures were cited by FMPs in the responses to the public consultations as one of the drivers of the costs imposed by the SFDR 146 , especially for FMPs subject to both the CSRD and the SFDR (i.e. subject to duplicative costs). This could also partially reduce the complexity by removing indicators that are the most complicated to report against, as described in section 5.\n\nHowever, this option only partially reduces the costs associated with entity-level disclosures, estimated to constitute around 25% of the overall recurring costs linked to disclosures and to represent an annual total of EUR 56 million in the baseline scenario 147 (see Annex 3, section 3.10).\n\nv\nExpected benefits and potential drawbacks for data users (mainly investors and supervisors)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this option reduces the amount of information available to investors, it would continue to allow for end-investors, civil society and supervisors to receive information to assess the sustainability ambition of an FMPs. Such information would allow data users to discern key sustainability related information on the direction of their overall investment policy (e.g. whether they intend to divest from fossil fuels) to inform their choices. This can allow tracking improvements by FMPs in reducing negative externalities in their investments over time and the alignment of the financial products they offer with their entity-level commitments and claims.\n\nWhile reducing the number of disclosures would mean that data users lose some ESG information, it also means that the investor-facing disclosures would focus on KPIs that are comparable and understandable. This could boost investors\u2019 ability to understand and compare the ESG ambitions and policies of FMPs and contribute to fighting greenwashing.\n\nHowever, there is little evidence that these disclosures are being used by end-investors. The majority of FMPs 148 have questioned the practicality of entity-level PAI disclosures for informed investment decision-making and argued that end-investors focus only on disclosures from specific financial products they might buy. That said, a majority of NGOs expressed support for having such disclosures in the SFDR 149 and NCAs\u2019 responses are split 150 . In addition, some research suggests that entity-level disclosures can have a positive impact on how FMPs manage their decarbonisation efforts 151 .\n\nv\nOverall assessment: effectiveness, efficiency and coherence\n\n\n\n\n\nEffectiveness in addressing the specific problems\n\nReducing the entity-level disclosures would partly help address the difficulties faced by data preparers in implementing the complex rules (problem driver 1) and would slightly reduce the cost (although the impact on cost cannot be assessed precisely as it will largely depend on the number of indicators that would be retained).\n\nHowever, option 1.1 would only partially fulfil the specific objective of simplifying and reducing administrative burdens as the bulk of the costs and implementation challenges reported by FMPs in implementing the entity-level disclosures is expected to stay the same. While the amount of ESG issues to track would be reduced, FMPs would still need to have processes in place to monitor the possible adverse impact of all their assets under management. In addition, the cost of reporting on the possible adverse impacts of all assets is expected to increase as a result of the omnibus proposal, as FMPs are likely to have access to less publicly available data and will need to use estimates. These estimates are either generated internally or bought from third-party data providers, imposing additional costs in both cases 152 . These estimates are typically derived from information obtained directly from investee companies, supplemented by additional research, collaboration with third-party data providers or external experts, or the use of reasonable assumptions.\n\nOption 1.1. is not expected to impact the end-investors\u2019 ability to understand and compare ESG products. However, option 1.1. does allow for higher levels of protection against greenwashing compared to option 1.2. as it allows data used to assess the alignment of the financial products offered by FMPs with their entity-level commitments and claims.\n\nEfficiency (costs)\n\nAs noted above, this option only partially reduces the costs associated with entity-level disclosures. These are estimated to constitute around 25% of the overall costs linked to disclosures and to represent an annual total of EUR 56 million in the baseline scenario (see Annex 3, section 3.10). Therefore, this option could be estimated to save less than half of this amount, i.e. less than EUR 28 million.\n\nCoherence\n\nChanges to entity level disclosures do not have a direct impact on the coherence between the SFDR and the rest of the sustainable finance framework (problem driver 2). In fact, the interactions between the SFDR and other sustainability-related financial regulation mainly related to the SFDR product level disclosures which interacts with other disclosures, labels and the distribution rules.\n\nThe only relevant interaction is with the CSRD reporting obligations which duplicate the SFDR entity-level disclosures for certain actors (i.e. the roughly 400 FMPs that are subject to both the CSRD and the SFDR today). Without a reduction in the personal scope of the entity level requirement under SFDR to match the future CSRD and a full operational alignment between the (future, post-omnibus) ESRS and reduced SFDR PAIs, Option 1.1 would not address the existing duplications.\n\nOption 1.2: deletion of principal adverse impact disclosures at entity-level\n\nv\nExpected benefits and potential drawbacks for data preparers (FMPs)\n\nOption 1.2. would considerably reduce the implementation costs associated with the SFDR by deleting all entity-level disclosures (i.e. 16 mandatory indicators). FMPs would only be asked to generate detailed product level disclosures for their ESG products, and not to assess and disclose the potential adverse impacts of all their assets. Removing disclosures linked to the 16 mandatory indicators would reduce the implementation costs associated with the SFDR. Only FMPs subject to the CSRD would need to assess the ESG impact of all their assets under management.\n\nNo potential drawbacks for data preparers were identified. FMPs outside the CSRD scope who wish to continue to report entity-level information would still have the option to do so under the future voluntary sustainability-information standards under the revised CSRD.\n\nv\nExpected benefits and potential drawbacks for data users (mainly investors and supervisors)\n\n\n\n\n\nDeleting entity-level disclosures on adverse impacts could risk creating a gap in terms of ESG information from economically relevant FMPs that often innovate or pursue long-term investment strategies, and which can inform supervisory oversight of transition risks. This could hinder e.g. tracking (i) improvements in reducing negative externalities of FMP investments over time, and (ii) alignment of financial products with FMPs\u2019 commitments and claims. Based on reporting figures from 2024, roughly 1650 FMPs (around 160 investment firms, 430 banks, 200 pension funds, 330 insurance and 530 asset management) provide entity-level disclosures. 430 are doing it on a mandatory basis 153 . Under option 1.2., the majority of these FMPs would be exempted from such disclosures under option 1.2. However, the largest FMPs (and therefore arguably the most impactful ones) would continue to disclose sustainability information under the CSRD and FMPs outside the CSRD scope could continue to report on a voluntary basis.\n\nv\nOverall assessment: effectiveness, efficiency and coherence\n\nEffectiveness in addressing the specific problems\n\nOption 1.2. addresses many of the difficulties faced by FMPs in coping with the lengthy requirements and the costs associated with the lack of publicly available ESG data (problem drivers 1 and 3). FMPs would not need to assess the potential adverse impact of all their assets under management anymore, as the SFDR would focus on the ESG assessments and disclosures for products making ESG claims. Option 1.2 would therefore fulfil the specific objective of simplifying and reducing administrative burdens. The largest FMPs would still need to disclose ESG entity level disclosures under the CSRD but would not be subject to duplicative obligations anymore which would lower the burden. The upcoming reduction of the number of indicators to be disclosed under the CSRD would further reduce the burdens for these entities.\n\nIn addition, this option is not expected to impact end-investors\u2019 ability to understand and compare ESG products. There is a trade-off whereby end-investors and distributors would be less able to track the alignment of financial products offered by FMPs with their entity-level commitments and claims which might lower investors\u2019 protection against greenwashing regarding FMPs\u2019 ESG claims made at the entity level. However, as stated before, there is little evidence that end-investors or distributors make use of entity-level SFDR information in this way.\n\nEfficiency (costs)\n\nThis option would largely cancel out the costs associated with entity-level disclosures compared to the baseline scenario, estimated to constitute around 25% of the overall costs linked to disclosures and to represent an annual total of EUR 56 million (see Annex 3, section 3.10). Based on the analysis in Annex 3, the bulk of the cost reduction is estimated to benefit SMEs (in aggregate, EUR 43 million) while the rest (EUR 13 million) would benefit larger FMPs.\n\nCoherence\n\nOption 1.2. would remove the duplications between the SFDR and the CSRD. This option ensures that future entity-level sustainability-linked reporting requirements are set in a comprehensive, cross-sectoral and coherent way in the ESRS and without scope for sector-specific additional requirements that would risk duplications or excessive complexity. For those FMPs outside the CSRD scope who so wish, options to disclose entity-level information would be based on future provisions under a revised CSRD for a voluntary sustainability-related information standard, envisaged in the shape of a delegated act based on the VSME standard developed by EFRAG 154 .\n\nComparative assessment of option 0, option 1.1 and option 1.2 impacts\n\nLegend: +++ = Very positive ++ = Positive + = Slightly positive +/- = Mixed effect 0 = no effect - = Slightly negative -- = Negative --- = very negative\n\n\t\n\nOption 0\n\n\t\n\nOption 1.1\n\n\t\n\nOption 1.2\n\n\n\n\nEffectiveness:\n\n\n\n\nIn simplifying and reducing the sustainability related requirements for FMPs\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nFMPs would not be required to disclose ESG information at entity level (apart from those subject to the CSRD).\n\n+++\n\n\t\n\nFMPs would have to disclose less ESG information, but the bulk of the cost related to entity-level ESG analysis and research would remain. In addition, FMPs not covered by the CSRD would still need to comply with entity-level disclosures, hindering the coherence of the framework.\n\n+\n\n\t\n\nFMPs would solely be subject to product level disclosures under the SFDR. This means that FMPs in scope of both the SFDR and CSRD would not be facing duplicating reporting anymore and that FMPs not subject to CSRD would not have to comply with entity-level disclosures anymore.\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\nIn improving end-investors\u2019 ability to understand and compare ESG products\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nEnd-investors would not receive information about the overall sustainability performance of FMPs outside the CSRD scope.

CSRD would be setting all entity-level disclosures throughout the framework while the SFDR would focus solely on financial products.\n\n+++\n\nStakeholders feedback\n\nThe overwhelming majority (89%) of consultation-respondents consider that the objective of the SFDR to strengthen transparency through sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector is still fully relevant and over 90% consider that this should be done at EU-level 155 .Overall, the demand for sustainable investment opportunities among investors also remains high 156 . Therefore, stakeholder feedback does not favour a repeal of the SFDR.\n\nViews of responding stakeholders in the public consultations were split on whether the SFDR is the right place to set entity-level disclosure requirements for FMPs and financial advisors, especially across the different stakeholder groups. As stated above, most FMPs and financial advisers responded that they do not consider the SFDR the right place to include entity-level disclosures 157 , while a majority of NGOs expressed support for having such disclosures in the SFDR 158 . NCAs\u2019 responses were split 159 .\u00a0Responses to the call for evidence 160 were largely in favour of deleting the entity level disclosures, with a small minority of stakeholders expressing preferences for keeping a small set of indicators.\u00a0\n\nRespondents\u2019\u00a0views on the usefulness of the three sets of SFDR entity-level disclosures were also split. Disclosures concerning sustainability risk policies gathered the highest level of support, with 49% (138 out of 280) of respondents finding them \u2018totally\u2019 or \u2018mostly\u2019 useful, while 15% (41 out of 280) responded \u2018not really\u2019 or \u2018not at all\u2019. Opinions are less definitive on disclosures regarding adverse sustainability impacts 161 and remuneration policies 162 .\u00a0\n\nOther economic, social, environmental and fundamental rights impact\n\nIn general, companies that are required to report against standards have to identify and report on their most significant non-financial risks, dependencies and impacts, and explain how they manage them. This discipline may have an indirect beneficial effect on the environment, society and fundamental rights, to the extent that it affects company decisions and the way companies behave. Options 0 and 1.2 could be expected to have detrimental impacts in this regard. There is, however, mixed evidence about the extent to which reporting requirements on their own will induce companies to mitigate and avoid their negative impacts, especially in comparison to policies and regulations that effectively price negative externalities 163 .\n\nIt is therefore not possible to ascertain the concrete relative merits of the options presented in terms of material social, environmental and fundamental rights impacts. Option 0 could arguably be seen as a more drastic move to roll back sustainability-related legislation, which could lead to more detrimental impacts in this regard, whereas option 1.2 would more likely be seen as a targeted move to remove inconsistencies and duplications in the framework, with fewer knock-on effects of this type. In addition, the specific impact of option 1.1. would largely depend on the indicators in the Level 2 regulation that would be removed and the indicators that would be retained. If this option were pursued, this would be best done in a secondary assessment when preparing the amended Level 2 text. Finally, the biggest FMPs (which are assumed to be the most impactful) would still be in scope of the CSRD and would therefore continue to report on social, environmental and fundamental right issuers. The impacts of options 1.1 and 1.2 are therefore expected to be limited 164 while those of option 0 could be broader, as mentioned.\n\nThe impact on the international competitiveness of EU companies is also expected to be limited, although, under option 1.1 compared to options 0 and 1.2, some additional costs would continue to be incurred by EU companies subject to the SFDR entity-level disclosures compared to non-EU companies. However, non-EU companies distributing products in the EU that are disclosing under the Articles 8 or 9 would continue to be expected to comply with the SFDR entity-level disclosures under option 1.1.\n\n6.2.2.\nChanges to product-level disclosures\n\nOption 2.1.: minimal changes to product-level disclosures\n\nThis option would broadly maintain the same approach as the current disclosures and would work better with categories that rely on existing concepts.\n\nv\nExpected benefits and potential drawbacks for data preparers (FMPs)\n\n\n\n\nOption 2.1. would address some of the implementation issues faced by data preparers by clarifying certain concepts underlying the product-level disclosures. For example, the specific disclosures required under the concept of consideration of principal adverse impacts would be clarified, removing some of the compliance challenges faced by the market today.\n\nHowever, the length and the complexity of the disclosures would remain. Data prepares would continue to face difficulties in implementing the complex rules and in gathering the extensive data needed from underlying investments. They are likely to continue to devote as much resources as they do now. In addition, data preparers would not be given a standardised method to disclose information about transition-related objectives and investments, i.e. there would be no recognition of transitional assets or strategy in the standardised questions of the templates.\n\nExpected benefits and potential drawbacks for data users (mainly investors and supervisors)\n\nOption 2.1. would preserve the variety in the range of datapoints in order to inform investors on many different sustainability-features of products. In addition, the targeted changes to some concepts such as \u2018promotion of ESG characteristics\u2019 or \u2018consideration of principal adverse impacts\u2019 would increase the comparability of the disclosures linked to these concepts.\n\nHowever, the disclosures would continue to be very lengthy and to rely on complex and technical concepts which are not easily understandable by all investors, especially by retail investors.\n\nv\nOverall assessment: effectiveness, efficiency and coherence\n\n\n\n\n\nEffectiveness in addressing the specific problems\n\nOption 2.1. would allow for minimal disruptions while partly simplifying and reducing the requirements for financial markets (problem driver 1). Targeted changes would simplify and clarify some of the complex ESG concepts such as the ones under the Article 7, 8 and 9 (e.g. consideration of principal adverse impacts and ESG characteristics). However, option 2.1. would not materially reduce the amount of data points that need to be generated by data preparers and would not address the difficulties they encounter when trying to access the necessary data from underlying investments (problem driver 3). It would therefore not fulfil in a satisfactory way the specific objective of simplifying and reducing administrative burdens.\n\nThis option would also only partly satisfy the specific objective of improving end-investors\u2019 ability to understand and compare ESG products. The length and complexity of the disclosures has been proven to be a barrier to investors\u2019 (especially retail investors\u2019) understanding (further explained in section 2 and the evaluation annex). While comparability would be increased as a result of the clarification of some concepts, investors would continue to be exposed to unnecessarily extensive sustainability information and, as a result, would not be more likely to understand the key sustainability features of products and would therefore not increase their protection against potentially misleading ESG claims.\n\nEfficiency (costs)\n\nThis option is not expected to materially reduce the costs associated with product-level disclosures in the baseline scenario, estimated to constitute around 75% of the overall annual recurring costs linked to\u00a0disclosures and to represent an annual total of EUR 190 million (see Annex 3, section 3.10) 165 .\n\nCoherence\n\nThere are multiple interlinkages between the SFDR product level disclosures and the rest of the sustainable finance framework, as described in Annex 6. However, minimal changes that would be restricted to clarification of certain terms would not have a considerable effect on the coherence with other rules. More specifically, the misalignments between the SFDR definition of \u2018sustainable investment\u2019 and similar concepts under the EU Taxonomy and the Benchmark Regulation would not be addressed 166 .\n\nSome targeted changes might be needed under the definition of sustainability preferences under MiFID and IDD to ensure that the modified SFDR disclosures are reflected in the way distributors assess clients\u2019 sustainability preferences.\n\nOption 2.2.: significant reduction of product-level disclosures\u00a0\n\nAs explained in section 5.3.2, the specific content of the disclosures would be largely defined by the type of category chosen and their underlying criteria. As a result, the analysis of the impacts of this option is linked to such criteria (which are analysed under section 6.3.2, i.e. the analysis of the impact of the categories) and described in section 5.4 and annex 8.\n\nv\nExpected benefits and potential drawbacks for data preparers (FMPs)\n\n\n\n\nOption 2.2 is expected to considerably cut costs for FMPs and give them more flexibility in the way they can assess and explain the sustainability characteristics or objective of their products. Instead of having to comply with a generic set of questions, relying on complex and data-intensive concepts, FMPs will be able to focus on a shorter number of relevant metrics. The information is however presented in a standardised format through shorter templates. By introducing more extensive cuts to requirements estimated to account for 75% of the costs of the current regime (see also under \u2018efficiency\u2019 below), the burden reduction would be expected to be higher than 25%, moving away from the set of about 25 questions to a few indicators and a short template for FMPs to prove their criteria.\n\nThe main drawbacks for data preparers would be linked to the transition costs and potential \u2018lost\u2019 implementation efforts and costs from the implementation of the current reporting approach.\n\nv\nExpected benefits and potential drawbacks for data users (mainly investors and supervisors)\n\n\n\n\nThe set of disclosures would be shorter, more comparable, and relevant based on a product\u2019s key sustainability objectives or characteristics. As a result, while end-investors and distributors would lose some information compared to today\u2019s situation, as the templates would not cover the wide range of SFDR sustainability concepts for all products anymore, they would have access to much more relevant and consistent information. Shorter and standardised templates containing the disclosures around the criteria are expected to give end-investors and distributors a much better sense of the levels of ambition of each product, and allow for an easier comparability of the information across products.\n\nIn addition, option 2.2. would rely on a terminology that would be much more understandable by non-experts. The language used by FMPs would move away from technical jargon such as \u2018consideration of principal adverse impacts\u2019, and would instead focus on sectoral exclusions, basic ESG KPIs and a simple explanation of the objective to which the financial product contributes or its main ESG characteristics (e.g. additional exclusions, filters based on best performers etc).\n\nv\nOverall assessment: effectiveness, efficiency and coherence\n\n\n\n\n\nEffectiveness in addressing the specific problems\n\nOption 2.2 would tackle challenges linked to the complexity of the current rules and to data availability (problem drivers 1 and 3) and largely simplify and reduce the sustainability related disclosure requirements for financial markets and therefore fulfil the specific objective of simplifying and reducing administrative burdens. First, the disclosures would rely on simpler and clearer concepts (as described in section 6.3) which are less data intensive. For example, instead of analysing the performance of a financial product against a large amount of sustainability concepts (such as the consideration of principal adverse impacts, the alignment with the EU Taxonomy criteria etc), FMPs will be able to focus their sustainability assessment and reporting on metrics that are relevant to their products. The data points to be reported would be significantly reduced.\n\nOption 2.2 would also largely satisfy the specific objective of improving end-investors\u2019 ability to understand and compare ESG products by setting up shorter, simpler and adequate disclosures based on the products\u2019 features. The categorisation of the product would reveal its main key features providing investors and distributors with the essential reassurance of what it aims to achieve, minimising the need for additional disclosures which can overwhelm investors. These disclosures are also expected to be more comparable, enabling investors to easily compare products that fall under the same category. The length of the reporting templates would be considerably shortened and would focus on what is relevant for an end-investor decision making.\n\nEfficiency (costs)\n\nCompared to option 2.1, this option is assessed to help reduce a far greater share of the costs associated with product-level disclosures in the baseline scenario, estimated to constitute around 75% of the overall costs linked to disclosures and to represent an annual total of EUR 190 million. Based on the analysis in Annex 3, in spite of some initial one-off adjustment costs, a conservative estimate of the long-run cost reduction for SMEs in aggregate could amount to EUR 35 million and to EUR 20 million for larger FMPs.\n\nCoherence\n\nAs described under option 2.2, and to overcome misalignments and duplications with other parts of the sustainable finance framework (problem driver 2), any changes to the SFDR concepts and product level disclosures would need to be reflected in other parts of the sustainable finance framework. In fact, a perfect alignment between the SFDR disclosures and the definition of sustainability preferences under MiFID and IDD will be necessary. This would entail amendments to the corresponding delegated acts under MiFID and IDD and for distributors to integrate information on categorisation in their processes. This can induce some initial implementation costs, but which will reduce the burdens on distributors overtime.\n\nThe future SFDR product level disclosures would need to be aligned with the CSRD disclosures to facilitate that ESG information required from FMPs is available from CSRD companies. The details of the SFDR disclosures would therefore need to be set in a subsequent level 2 act, following the adoption of the simplified ESRS.\n\nComparative assessment of the impacts\n\nLegend: +++ = Very positive ++ = Positive + = Slightly positive +/- = Mixed effect 0 = no effect - = Slightly negative -- = Negative --- = very negative\n\n\t\n\nOption 0\n\n\t\n\nOption 2.1\n\n\t\n\nOption 2.2\n\n\n\n\nEffectiveness:\n\n\n\n\nIn simplifying and reducing the sustainability related requirements for FMPs\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nRemoves all product level disclosure requirements.\n\n+++\n\n\t\n\nPartly addresses the implementation challenges through targeted changes, but the bulk of the reporting burdens and challenges would remain\n\n+\n\n\t\n\nLargely simplifies and reduces the disclosure requirements by reducing drastically the amount of data points and relying on much simpler concepts.\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\nIn improving end-investors\u2019 ability to understand and compare ESG products\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nRemoves lengthy and unclear product level disclosures but leaves a regulatory void in terms of structured ESG information or products, increasing search costs and leaving investors dependent on market-based solutions, with possible risks of greenwashing.\n\n--\n\n\t\n\nPartly addresses the barriers to investors\u2019 understanding and improves comparability.

The conclusion that stakeholder feedback does not favour a repeal of the SFDR can be re-confirmed.\n\nHowever, respondents to the public consultations largely agree that changes to the product-level disclosures are warranted. In fact, 84% (249 out of 296) totally or mostly agreed that the disclosures required by the SFDR are not sufficiently useful to investors, and 82% (247 out of 301) that some of its requirements and concepts, such as \u2018sustainable investment \u2019are not sufficiently clear for end-investors.\n\nIn terms of which KPIs are necessary for end-investors, a large majority of respondents answered that the disclosures should be restricted to key meaningful indicators that are comparable across different markets and asset classes and easily understandable for retail investors. Respondents mostly mentioned climate, diversity and human rights as topics to be covered by the disclosures. Conversely, some respondents, mainly from the NGO sector, suggested that there should be a comprehensive set of disclosures which could include the mandatory PAIs, alignment with the EU Taxonomy, percentage of investments in undertakings with a science-based transition plan, exclusions and engagement.\n\n55% (152 out of 274) of respondents totally or mostly agreed that products with sustainability claims should be required to substantiate their claims with additional disclosure to ensure credibility and prevent greenwashing. While there was no clear consensus about what these qualitative and quantitative disclosures should be, the most cited ones include: sustainability objectives, sustainable investment strategy and associated binding and measurable KPIs, minimum standards of good governance, percentage of sustainable investments and Taxonomy-alignment, decarbonisation targets, percentage of undertakings having a transition plan, applied exclusions, engagement and voting policies and PAIs. Some respondents argued that such disclosures should be set in a flexible manner to align with diverse product investment strategies and to accommodate innovation and evolving market standards. On the other hand, others are of the view that these disclosures should be set by the regulators and be identical for all financial products with sustainability claims.\n\nLastly, many respondents agreed on the importance of aligning these disclosures with potential product categories and that any changes to the SFDR disclosures would need to be reflected in the MiFID and IDD sustainability preferences rules.\n\nThe responses to the call for evidence 167 confirmed that a large majority of stakeholders across the board welcome considerable simplifications to product level disclosures (for example by limiting the number of pages for the pre-contractual document to 2 to 3 pages), focusing on key information for investors regarding e.g. the potential classification of a product and adherence to associated criteria, its main sustainability-linked objectives and strategy, and KPIs for measuring performance.\u00a0\n\nOther economic, social, environmental and fundamental rights impacts\n\nThe other impacts of the options are hard to assess as, aside from the repeal option, they will mainly depend on the KPIs selected at level 2. The repeal option would again be a more drastic withdrawal by the EU from setting requirements for sustainability-linked information regarding financial products, which could have more detrimental impacts in terms of real-world ESG outcomes, whereas the other two options suggest keeping the existence of key ESG disclosures for financial products, which will retain the positive indirect impact the SFDR currently has on social, environmental and fundamental rights.\n\nMaking these disclosures more efficient, clearer and understandable would result in better information regarding the social, environmental and fundamental rights impacts of financial products. This could in turn attract more private capital into products that have a genuine positive impact, or mitigate better their negative impacts, on these aspects.\n\n6.3.\nOptions for setting up a clear and coherent sustainability-linked product categorisation system\n\nThis section follows a two-step approach for the assessment of impacts. First, it assesses the general impact of setting up categories following the approach of option 3.1 and 3.2 (i.e. with new criteria). This step is done to isolate the general impacts of creating new categories and focuses on the similarities shared by option 3.1 and 3.2. The analysis of the impact largely relies on the elements of the criteria described in section 5.4 (see box 3). While details for such criteria will be finalised in Level 2, the key features set in Level 1 allow to conduct a robust analysis of the likely impact of the categories.\n\nAs a second step, we conduct a simultaneous assessment of the three options to differentiate their relative benefits and costs and to highlight their contribution to the specific objectives while clearly distinguishing the extent of these effects.\n\n6.3.1.\nMain benefits and potential drawbacks of setting up new categories under option 3.1 and 3.2\n\nSetting up voluntary categories accompanied by a clear set of new criteria (instead of relying on existing complex SFDR concepts) would ease the implementation burden over time. The different layers of requirements described in the evaluation (Annex 11) would be simplified and streamlined and would be more adaptable to the different objectives or strategies used. In addition, the criteria would provide legal certainty by replacing the central SFDR concepts which have proven to be difficult to apply with clear ESG requirements based on market practice pursuant to the ESMA guidelines (e.g. simple exclusion list instead of a list of indicators to \u2018consider\u2019) (problem drivers 1 and 2). The new approach to the criteria would also be less data intensive and allow FMPs to focus on the ESG topics that they find most relevant to their products (problem driver 3). The clarification of the requirements attached to the categories would also favour the alignment of regulatory expectations from NCAs, facilitating their oversight, and would alleviate the need for long disclosure templates thanks to the shorter format of the disclosures. All these benefits would ultimately lead to less burdens and costs in the long run through clearer and simpler criteria. The costs of estimates are minimised through the use of sustainability data points for which estimation is possible (e.g. which are binary or where using sectoral and geographical averages is possible) and where market practices are well established.\n\nThe introduction of formal categories relying on criteria would induce an initial implementation cost. However, the suggested criteria would build on the criteria introduced by the ESMA guidelines on fund names 168 . There are currently approximately 4,220 investment funds in scope of these guidelines, meaning that these products have already borne the initial cost of applying such criteria 169 . Annex 8 describes in more detail the specific impacts of the ESMA guidelines on funds using ESG terms in their name, which started applying as of 21 May 2025. For products outside the scope of ESMA guidelines (i.e. insurance and pension products), mitigating measures could be established to soften the implementation costs for those willing to voluntarily use the product categories, via for example a phase-in of the new rules (i.e. FMPs could still apply the current framework for some time). In addition, a grandfathering clause could be applied for existing close-ended funds that could not feasibly amend their portfolio to fit the required criteria.\u00a0\n\nThe set up of categories would also have the potential to drastically simplify and improve the investors\u2019 journey and enhance their protection against misleading ESG claims, the extent of which would depend on the potential market coverage of the categorisation system chosen, i.e. whether all products making ESG claims would need to comply with EU minimum criteria. As described in the problem definition, investors are currently misled by the use of the disclosure articles as a self-categorisation system by the market (problem driver 4). Setting up categories with clear minimum ESG requirements would improve the comparability of categorised products and would enhance the understanding of products\u2019 main ESG objectives. The mandatory minimum criteria would also ensure minimum ESG performance and ambition and lead to enhanced trust and confidence in products that are categorised and reinforcing the protection of investors against misleading or false ESG claims for categorised products.\n\nOf course, an important consideration to be added is that there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 on how to granularly define what a positive contribution to a sustainability objective should be. This is mainly due to the wide variety of assets, strategies, sustainability objectives that exist in the current market, and which it is important to continue fostering to support innovation and competitiveness. The suggested criteria ensuring harmonised levels of contributions and common exclusions favour continuity with those market practices and the lates updates to the regulatory framework 170 . As acknowledged at the start of section 5, there is a trade-off between relying on less data to inform categories and investors on the one hand, and possible concerns of greenwashing on the other.\u00a0However, to balance the objectives of simplification and comparability, support for innovation and investor protection, a choice needs to be made how and on what basis to cluster and capture products in order to convey their main ESG features. The key is to ensure this is done on the basis of data that is both available to a large degree, possible to estimate without excessive effort in case it cannot be derived directly from investees, and is proven to be the most decision-useful for investors, based on their preferences when investing in sustainability-related financial products. Thus, in pursuing the objectives in section 4 in order to ensure coherent, effective and efficient outcomes, while on the one hand the risks of greenwashing for investors cannot be totally excluded, they are minimised through compliance by FMPs with the minimum criteria for ESG product categories and accompanying disclosures including the performance of the product against the objective they have contributed to based on credible, and where possible science-based, indicators. Investors would have a defined dataset, more discrete and less sprawling and overwhelming, to help inform choices and compare products. They could more easily identify where products provide additional datapoints of interest to them, on top of the minimum criteria, facilitating switching between products and providers.\n\nFinally, there are certain limitations to note in how far the categorisation would incentivise prospective investee companies to improve ESG performance. This impact assessment, including the articulation of the problems and specific objectives, primarily looks at the relationship between the end-investor and the financial intermediary, the subject matter of the SFDR. Many other factors besides better transparency, information symmetry and greater comparability in this relationship determine overall market outcomes in terms of efficient capital allocation in the real economy. The initiative therefore needs to be seen in tandem notably with steps towards the Savings and Investments Union, which are beyond the scope of this impact assessment, to fully achieve the general objectives.\n\n6.3.2.\nComparative assessment of Option 3.1, Option 3.2 and Option 3.3\n\nOptions 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, mostly differ by their market coverage size, their treatment of transition finance, and their underlying criteria. These distinct features entail important differences in the role that the categories could play for retail investors and in the wider framework, especially regarding the marketing and distribution rules (as described in section 5). This leads to important differences in terms of achieving the specific objectives of the review.\n\nLegend: +++ = Very positive ++ = Positive + = Slightly positive +/- = Mixed effect 0 = no effect - = Slightly negative -- = Negative --- = very negative\n\nSpecific objective 1: the extent to which the categories simplify and reduce sustainability related requirements for FMPs and enhance coherence\n\n\n\n\nOption 3.1\n\n\t\n\nThe categories would bring coherence and provide FMPs with one common EU set of rules for products making ESG claims and/or be distributed to retail investors with sustainability preferences across the EU. They would help overcome different expectations from NCAs which are taking different approaches to regulate ESG claims, on top of requirements to adhere to the ESMA guidelines when making ESG claims in the name of funds (not covering all products within the SFDR scope however nor marketing documentation). The different sets of rules depending on where the claims are made and on the jurisdictions would be harmonised. Under this approach, the criteria of the categories could be used to define the extent to which a product can make ESG claims to investors and would harmonise the national regulatory and supervisory expectations, thereby addressing the current uncertainty regarding SFDR compliance. However, it is important to note that the categories would be voluntary, therefore FMPs could still include ESG information on regulatory documentations of non-categorised products without having to comply with EU categories and applicable criteria 171 .\n\nDisclosures linked to categorised products would be shortened and focused on ESG information which is more readily available. In addition, this option would keep a broader scope (i.e. of the options, three categories could cover the most products disclosing under Article 8/9), ensuring the highest levels of continuity in terms of the marketing communication and names of products.\n\nThe categories could also provide for a very useful tool for operators in charge of assessing the sustainability preferences of clients and defining the target market under MiFID and IDD. Instead of relying on complex and poorly comparable disclosures, distributors could use the three clusters to easily identify suitable products and would also have access to more granular information through the product disclosures.\n\nFinally, the transition category would equip FMPs with suitable criteria according to inclusive and well-established metrics (and accompanying disclosures linked to ESG data which is available and reliable) for products contributing to the EU transition to a greener and fairer economy. The criteria for the new transition category would not be disruptive as they reflect market practice pursuant to the ESMA guidelines, and will continue to be supervised by national supervisors 172 .\n\n\t\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\nOption 3.2\n\n\t\n\nThe narrow scope of this option means that both categorised and non-categorised products could make ESG claims (i.e. FMPs would be allowed to make ESG claims in marketing documentation and names on non-categorised products). It would not limit the right to make ESG claims to the products making a direct positive contribution to sustainability or transition objectives due to the small portion of market that would be covered. However, for non-categorised ESG products, FMPs are still likely to face\u00a0different sets of rules depending on the type of products or depending on national rules. While this option would set criteria for fewer products (although a part of the non-categorised products would likely still be subject to the ESMA guidelines), it would also not address the differing regulatory expectations in the supervision of ESG non-categorised products.\n\nThis option would also only partly support the distributors in the implementation of the sustainability preferences of clients under MiFID and IDD. Operators would still need to rely on disclosures for all non-categorised products with ESG features.\n\nLike option 3.1, the transition category would ease the implementation of the regime for products with transition-related products, following ESMA guidelines.\n\n\t\n\n+\n\n\n\n\nOption 3.3\n\n\t\n\nThis option would largely affirm the practice in the market of treating Article 8 and 9 as de facto categories, namely for \u2018sustainable\u2019 and \u2018other ESG\u2019 products. It would entail maintaining the existing sustainability concepts deemed complex and confusing to FMPs. Therefore, the simplification potential of option 3.1 and 3.2 (described in section 6.3.1) would not apply to option 3.3. FMPs would continue to face complex and unclear rules when applying the existing articles as categories. Gold-plating practices are also likely to continue, as NCAs could be expected to continue to refine national approaches to act on greenwashing concerns in the absence of clear harmonised EU criteria. Coherence with the rest of the framework would also be largely unchanged, i.e. the misalignments between the SFDR definition of \u2018sustainable investment\u2019 and similar concepts under the EU Taxonomy and the Benchmark Regulation would not be addressed 173 .\n\nNo distinct category to promote transition investments would be set up 174 .\n\nThis option could be seen, however, as less disruptive,\u00a0as the bulk of the existing \u2018criteria\u2019 would be retained. The categories might integrate the minimum safeguards of the ESMA guidelines but would largely remain aligned with the current content and principles of Articles 8 and 9.\n\n\t\n\n+/-\n\n\n\n\nSpecific objective 2: the extent to which the categories improve end-investors ability to understand and compare ESG products\n\n\n\n\nOption 3.1\n\n\t\n\nThe categories would largely simplify the investment journey of end-investors by providing a coherent and harmonised set of criteria that all products making ESG claims need to comply with, regardless of where they are marketed. All investors could trust that any products making prominent ESG claims are complying with robust and harmonised EU minimum safeguards and criteria. End investors would also see which category a product belongs to and could very easily understand their sustainability objectives and levels of ambition. The three groupings can offer a clear picture to investors regarding the type of ESG products available and how they differ. For example, contrary to the situation today, investors would have upfront reassurance whether a product can have significant fossil fuel exposure (transition category) or not (sustainable category), and that they cannot invest in assets linked to questionable human rights records (all categories). This would avoid having to read the details behind products, would mitigate negative surprises and make it easier for investors to compare all ESG products both within a category and between them.\n\nIn addition, providing the possibility that all ESG products are categorised (and therefore comply with EU criteria) would do away with the need for lengthy disclosures. In fact, categories would ensure higher levels of investors protection through minimum safeguards and by removing the need for investors to go through complex and lengthy disclosures to understand the ESG features and ambitions of products. By establishing the key parameters for products to be categorised as either sustainable, transition or other ESG, supported by the need to demonstrate progress toward or alignment with the objectives by way of indicators, but without specifying ex ante in the Regulation exactly how FMPs are to set and meet these objectives, investors would have upfront reassurance that products in each category deliver what they claim to do, while not over-regulating the matter and stifling product innovation.\n\nIt will be imperative that the name of the categories correctly reflects their respective levels of ambition and type of criteria. It is important that end-investors understand the differences between products that are mainly focused on sustainable assets (sustainable category), ones which focus on assets helping the transition of various economic sectors (transition category), and products that are applying much lighter ESG criteria (other ESG category). If this distinction if not made clear, end-investors could be misled in thinking that all categorised products offer the same levels of ESG performance.\n\n\t\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\nOption 3.2\n\n\t\n\nOn the one hand, end-investors would be able to easily identify the most ambitious products in the market. The adherence to a category would be made visible, and retail investors interested in sustainability would be easily directed towards products with genuine positive contribution. On the other hand, there would be no minimum safeguards for a large portion of products making ESG claims. The investor protection against misleading claims from non-categorised products would not be increased compared to today\u2019s situation.\n\nThese risks could be mitigated by the ESG disclosures that could be imposed on non-categorised products making ESG claims. In addition, certain ESG terms could be restricted for non-categorised products (for example, \u2018sustainable\u2019, \u2018transition\u2019 etc). The extent to which FMPs would be allowed to communicate on ESG elements in the marketing documentations of non-categorised products could also be limited (e.g. no more than x% of their marketing materials).\n\nHowever, such additional disclosures would work against the first objective of overall simplification and burden reduction. It is also doubtful that end-investors (more particularly retail) would effectively be aware of and appreciate the differences between an ESG categorised and an ESG non-categorised product and could therefore align their expectations accordingly. As a result, their ability to understand the differences in claims between categorised and non-categorised products, and notably compare ESG non-categorised products, would remain limited.\n\n\t\n\n+\n\n\n\n\nOption 3.3\n\n\t\n\nThis option would not have a strong impact on the extent to which end investors can understand and compare ESG products, largely perpetuating today\u2019s situation. In addition, the lack of transition category would not enable investors to easily identify those products and might prevent investors from properly comparing products if criteria/disclosures for transition products are not implemented.\n\n\t\n\n+/-\n\nv\nRelative efficiency (costs)\n\nExpected costs and benefits of option 3.1 and 3.2\n\nAssessing the cost-efficiency of creating categories is more difficult compared to assessing the cost-efficiency of changes to SFDR disclosures. Disclosures are part of the requirements today, for which cost estimates under the baseline scenario are available (Annex 3), whereas categories are not.\n\nFirst, estimating the initial one-off costs associated with the setup of new categories by engaging with FMPs has yielded limited data. These suggest initial one-off costs for a single FMP starting as of EUR 30 000, with others suggesting one-off costs in the range of EU 60 000 to EUR 500 000. This is mainly because, at this preparatory stage of policy development, FMPs do not have clarity on the type of criteria that would accompany these categories yet.\n\nIn addition, estimates also differ on the size of recurring costs associated with categories. Some expect this to represent 5-10% of initial one-off costs. However, the recurring costs with categories would be expected to be lower than the recurring costs of the current SFDR in the longer term due to the following factors:\n\n(1)\nThe rules are expected to be much clearer and to limit gold-plating which would result in less compliance costs linked to uncertainty and to applying different national regimes.\n\n(2)\nThe criteria would build on elements that are already being applied by some financial products under other regulatory pieces (i.e. all funds subject to the ESMA guidelines on funds names would not need to bear the one-off implementation cost again 175 ). As mentioned above, the criteria could be phased in for others (insurance and pensions products). Option 3.1 and 3.2 suggest removing some existing requirement under the SFDR while building on some of the rules under the ESMA guidelines, which should lead to cost reduction for FMPs currently subject to both.\n\n(3)\nThe criteria would be less data intensive and would allow FMPs to focus on a reduced number of datapoints. In addition, these criteria would better reflect, in a far more cost-effective way, the availability of data in the post-omnibus landscape. Categories are thus an effective and efficient way to overcome data gaps compared to today\u2019s baseline scenario in which SFDR disclosures would continue to hinge on access to data which is less likely to be available.\n\nAs outlined in section 5.3, the categories would also not involve changes to supervisory costs, nor entail new external verification costs for FMPs, which could otherwise have negative impacts on efficiency. Categories and associated reduced product disclosures also help investors to benefit from data which is more meaningful, decision-relevant and entails lower search-costs \u2013 and therefore more efficient from their perspective.\n\nFinally, the costs reported by FMPs should be offset against the savings achieved from reduced disclosures. Given the uncertainty of costs related to categories vs. the availability of cost-estimates for disclosures, it is however not possible to arrive at a reliable estimate of the net figure at this stage.\u00a0 Annex 3 sets out a rough indication suggesting that there could be some initial one-off costs notably for FMPs which are SMEs which choose to be active in offering ESG products, which could however be offset in the long-term by corresponding cost savings. Given scale-effects, one-off costs for larger FMPs are assessed to be far more limited and which could be quickly offset (after about 2 years) 176 .\n\nExpected costs and benefits of option 3.3\n\nOption 3.3 (minimum changes) is not expected to entail significant changes to costs (negative or positive). Low initial one-off costs are to be expected, and the current high recurring costs should remain very similar, although targeted changes to the existing sustainability concepts could slightly reduce these.\n\nv\nRelative other economic, social, environmental and fundamental rights impacts\n\nUnder option 3.1, categories would imply that a larger number of products would apply EU minimum safeguards, which is expected to have an indirect positive impact on social, environmental and fundamental rights (although the new minimum safeguards would cover fewer sustainability aspects than the current DNSH, but these often relate to factors which are not considered by products anyway 177 ). Under option 3.2, fewer products would apply such safeguards, therefore limiting the positive impact that the SFDR can have in this regard. However, option 3.2 could potentially encourage FMPs to produce more ambitious products, due to the absence of an inclusive lighter 3rd category. This could potentially lead to positive social, environmental and fundamental rights impacts. Under option 3.3, a large number of products would be in scope, but the criteria might be less impactful, therefore reducing the potential positive impact.\n\nGiven the dominant share of the EU sustainable investment market (84% of global sustainable fund assets 178 ), simple categories could further boost the EU as an attractive market for investors interested in sustainability.\n\nSummary of relative impacts\n\nComparative effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and other economic and ESG impact\n\nLegend: +++ = Very positive ++ = Positive + = Slightly positive +/- = Mixed effect 0 = no effect - = Slightly negative -- = Negative --- = very negative\n\n\t\n\nOption 3.1\n\n\t\n\nOption 3.2\n\n\t\n\nOption 3.3\n\n\n\n\nEffectiveness:\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nIn simplifying and reducing the sustainability related requirements for FMPs and enhancing coherence\n\n\t\n\n+++\n\n\t\n\n+\n\n\t\n\n+/-\n\n\n\n\n(2)\nIn improving end-investors\u2019 ability to understand and compare ESG products\n\n\t\n\n+++\n\n\t\n\n+\n\n\t\n\n+/-\n\n\n\n\nOverall effectiveness:\n\n\t\n\n+++\n\n\t\n\n+\n\n\t\n\n+/-\n\n\n\n\nEfficiency\n\n\t\n\n++\n\n\t\n\n++\n\n\t\n\n+\n\nv\nStakeholders\u2019 feedback\n\nThe public consultation revealed strong support for a voluntary categorisation system regulated at the EU level: A large majority of respondents believe that EU sustainability product categories are necessary for an efficient distribution system based on investors\u2019 sustainability preferences (69%), to combat greenwashing (64%), and to facilitate professional investors (72%) and retail investors (80%) understanding of products\u2019 sustainability-related strategies and objectives. 72% of respondents believe that disclosures alone are not enough to achieve these objectives. While the distribution of responses is similar across different stakeholder groups, respondents belonging to or representing the three financial services sectors (insurance, asset management and banking sector) have a slightly different view as regards the benefits of product categories for investors. 42% (11 out of 26) of respondents belonging to or representing the insurance sector totally or mostly agree that a categorisation system would improve understanding among professional investors, compared to 73% (104 out of 143) and 76% (13 out of 17) in the asset management and banking sectors, respectively. Similarly, 50% (13 out of 26) of the insurance sector respondents believe a categorisation system would help retail investors, compared to 84% (120 out of 143) and 76% (13 out of 17) in the asset management and banking sectors, respectively.\n\nIn addition, the call for evidence 179 confirmed a very large support for creating categories. Most respondents expressed support for creating 3 categories (sustainable, transition, and other ESG), while a small minority preferred 2 categories (sustainable and transition). A small portion of stakeholders also expressed interest for a standalone impact category, while acknowledging that impact products could also fall under the sustainable or transition category and disclose how they conduct impact investing.\n\nThe responses to the call for evidence also showed a general agreement regarding the need to align the criteria with the ESMA guidelines (i.e. the PAB and CTB exclusions). Many have also urged to ensure that the criteria will be adapted to all types of asset classes, while underlining that certain assets classes (such as derivatives, real estate and sovereigns) face considerable challenges under the current rules. Stakeholders from the insurance and pension sectors have urged to ensure that the criteria would fit their sectoral specificities.\n\n7.\nPREFERRED COMBINATION OF POLICY OPTIONS\n\nOn the basis of the comparison of options carried out in section 6, the preferred option would combine option 1.2 for entity-level disclosures, 2.2 for product-level disclosures, and 3.1 for the set-up of sustainability-related categories.\n\n7.1.\nImpacts of preferred options on the specific objectives\n\nThis combination of the preferred options is the more efficient and effective overall way to achieve the two specific objectives:\n\n(1)\nFMPs would be provided with three categories with simple criteria for all ESG products. Compared to the current system, the new approach would create one set of coherent rules regarding ESG claims in names, marketing communication and in the distribution of such products, more geared towards FMPs and investors with an interest in ESG products which would be easier to compare as they would be based on shorter and standardised templates, . The criteria would provide clarity on the regulatory expectations and would also lower the risks of national gold plating. Excessive information requirements which are based on data which is less available and are not found to be decision-useful for investors would be cut. While these new categories may involve an initial cost in the short term (for FMPs and products not already subject to the ESMA guidelines), this would be duly phased in. The trade-off is also justified as the simplification measures are anticipated to reduce recurring costs over the medium to longer term, ultimately leading to greater overall efficiency. Long-term adherence to the fewer rules linked to the categories would be streamlined and much simpler than the current rules FMPs need to comply with. The disclosure requirements that would accompany these disclosures would be much shorter than the current reporting template under the Article 8 and 9. Therefore, as set out in Annex 3, costs linked to product level disclosures are expected to be significantly reduced while those related to entity-level disclosures would disappear.\u00a0Over time, these would offset the one-off costs of moving to the new rules.\n\n(2)\nThe categories would effectively cluster the ESG financial products into three groupings depending on ESG objectives and levels of ambition. End-investors would be able to easily and quickly understand whether a financial product is focused on contributing to a sustainability objective/made largely of sustainable assets, if a product is focused on helping companies to transition toward more sustainable practices, or if a product is applying broader or lighter ESG strategies. The underlying criteria of the categories would ensure harmonised minimum ESG performance, notably against risks deemed unacceptable by the majority of sustainability-minded investors 180 , thereby increasing investors\u2019 protection against greenwashing risks. Also, accompanying product disclosures would be made easier and simpler for them, giving them the essential information which experience demonstrates is of greatest value 181 , with an opportunity for investors to get more detailed information on the ESG features if they want. This would facilitate the comparison of ESG products falling under the same category.\n\n7.2.\nImpacts of preferred options on the general objectives\n\nThe preferred options would help contribute to the general objectives. Namely, they would help boost the integrity of the EU single market for sustainable finance by fighting greenwashing in an effective and efficient way, by replacing lengthy and complex disclosures with targeted minimum safeguards and ambition criteria, which would apply to all products making ESG claims or be distributed to retail investors with preferences for sustainable products. This would also help encourage the efficient allocation of capital for Europe\u2019s sustainable prosperity by boosting trust in ESG financial products and contributing to re-directing private capital that either contribute positively to EU sustainable goals or avoid harm to these objectives as part of deeper, more integrated and more competitive EU financial markets. No other EU legislation sets ESG disclosures for financial products which can help serve this purpose, and market-based solutions which would deliver the same are highly unlikely to emerge. Of course, as the options address the specific objectives identified for this initiative, they would need to work in tandem with other factors, involving the efficient functioning of markets and determining capital allocation, which are beyond the scope of this impact assessment, to fully achieve the general objectives.\n\nThe combination of the preferred options is expected to directly or indirectly contribute to positive environmental, social and human rights impacts through its three ESG categories, underpinning criteria and accompanying simpler disclosures. All ESG products would need to comply with EU minimum safeguards if they wish to make ESG claims or be distributed as such. These safeguards would include, depending on the nature of the claims, elements linked to the respect of human rights, adherence to social safeguards and norms, and mitigation of key environmental impacts. Certain ESG products would also need to demonstrate their positive contribution to environmental, social or fundamental right objectives, in order to fall under the more ambitious categories (sustainable and transition). These products would also need to comply with minimum disclosure requirements, which would include reporting on some social aspects.\n\nThis initiative is also expected to directly or indirectly contribute to the achievement of UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) notably those related to the climate, environment and social progress by ensuring that ESG financial products can more efficiently both contribute to and not cause harm to these goals. Finally, in this regard the combination of the preferred options is also assessed to be the best way to ensure that the revised SFDR is consistent with the climate neutrality objective of the climate law 182 .\n\n7.3.\nREFIT (simplification and improved efficiency)\n\nAs per the specific objective 1 (and the description of the impact of the preferred option on this objective in section 6), the combination of the preferred options has the potential to drastically simplify and improve the efficiency of the legislation.\n\n7.4.\nApplication of the \u2018one in, one out\u2019 approach\n\nThe quantifiable costs of this initiative are categorised as administrative costs from a better regulation perspective as they link to costs for disclosures to the public.\n\nFor the preferred option 1.2, we estimate an annual saving of EUR 56 million compared to the baseline. For the preferred option 2.2. we conservatively estimate annual recurring savings of at least EUR 55 million and for 3.1 we were unable to collect sufficient quantitative evidence to estimate the costs with a sufficient degree of statistical confidence.\n\nOverall, Annex 3 suggests a net reduction in administrative costs from the initiative 183 .\n\n8.\nHOW WILL ACTUAL IMPACTS BE MONITORED AND EVALUATED?\n\nTo monitor progress towards meeting the specific and general objectives, the Commission services would continue to work together with established processes underway notably with the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) and the Platform for Sustainable Finance (PSF) to analyse:\n\n(1)\nThe costs incurred by the industry - The ESAs and the NCAs could be tasked to survey and assess the implementation costs linked to the new categorisation system at the latest 3 years after its implementation. This assessment could also monitor the cost reductions from the reduced disclosures and assessing how the market is adapting to the new rules.\n\n(2)\nPossible occurrences of greenwashing in EU markets. The ESAs \u2013 together with the national competent authorities (NCAs) are already monitoring the occurrences of greenwashing and supervise sustainability-related claims. Their 2023 and 2024 reports 184 assess which areas of the sustainable investment value chain (SIVC) are more exposed to the risk of greenwashing. The Commission could work with the ESAs to conduct these assessments regularly (e.g. every two years), including to help assess the effectiveness of the future SFDR as a tool against greenwashing and amid the changes introduced by the omnibus proposals.\n\n(3)\nCapital flows to sustainable investment \u2013 the Platform for Sustainable Finance has developed a novel framework for monitoring capital flows to sustainable investment, i.e. the financing of a clean and competitive transition 185 . The Commission could work with the PSF to conduct a targeted analysis a few years after the implementation of the regime to assess the degree to which the categorisation system, together with the simplified disclosures, has helped boost financing toward sustainable economic activities and projects and helped lower the cost of capital linked to these.\n\n(4)\nThe understanding of EU retail investors \u2013 Finally, the Commission could work with the ESAs and other associations to conduct a consumer survey a few years after the implementation of the regime. The survey could test whether the categories and their accompanying streamlined disclosures have managed to improve consumers\u2019 ability to understand and compare ESG products and deliver credible ESG information to investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnex 1: Procedural information\n\n1.\nLead DG, Decide Planning/CWP references\n\nThis Impact Assessment Report was prepared by Directorate C \"Financial Markets\" of the Directorate General \"Directorate-General for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union\" (DG FISMA). The Decide Planning reference of the \"Revision of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)\" is PLAN/2024/2126. This initiative is part of the Commission\u2019s Work Programme Simplification 2025.\n\n2.\nOrganisation and timing\n\nSeveral services of the Commission with an interest in the initiative have been involved in the development of this analysis. Three Inter-Service Steering Group (ISSG) meetings, consisting of representatives from various Directorates-General of the Commission, were held in 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe first meeting took place on 2 October 2024 attended by representatives from DEFIS, ENV, CLIMA, EMPL, GROW, JUST, JRC, SJ, INTPA, and the Secretariat General (SG).\n\nThe second meeting was held on 24 April 2025. Representatives from DEFIS, MOVE, SJ, INTPA, ENV, CLIMA, EMPL, GROW, JUST, ENER, JRC and the Secretariat General (SG) were present.\n\nThe third meeting was held on 21 May 2025 and was attended by JRC, EMPL, MOVE, DEFIS, GROW, CLIMA, JUST, ENER, ENV and the SG. This was the last meeting of the ISSG before the submission to the Regulatory Scrutiny Board on 4 June 2025. The meetings were chaired by FISMA.\n\nDG FISMA has considered the comments made by DGs in the final version of the IA.\n\n3.\nConsultation of the RSB\n\nThe Impact Assessment report was examined by the Regulatory Scrutiny Board on 2 July 2025. The Board gave a negative opinion with the following comments. The changes in response to the comments are summarised under each respective point below (referring to version 1). The Board gave a positive opinion with reservations on the revised version on 8 October 2025, changes to which are also summarised below (referring to version 2).\n\nRSB comment version 1: Policy options are not sufficiently specified to allow for an adequate assessment and comparison. The report leaves evidence uncovered that is necessary to justify and ensure feasibility, effectiveness and efficiency of the action at level 2.\n\n\n\n\nChanges made to the IA: The report includes a more detailed description of what the policy options would concretely look like, mainly by providing a detailed description/example for streamlined disclosures and criteria for the proposed categories.\n\nThese specifications are added to the core report (section 5.3.2 for a description of the disclosures and section 5.4 for a description of the criteria, notably box 3) and further detailed in Annex 8 (which also provides illustration of what the level 2 criteria could look like and a mock disclosure template). Sections 5.3 and 5.4 also explain the detail of what would be developed in level 1 vs. level 2.\n\nThe report also includes evidence of the feasibility of relying on such disclosures and criteria to achieve the specific objectives, mainly taken from market analysis of current practices and compliance with existing obligations. Evidence shows that the suggested criteria build on data that is available to a significant degree and are already applied by a large portion of the market, in contrast to other datapoints which are less available. It also explains how the introduction of such criteria would largely align with investors\u2019 known preferences (based on studies outlined in Annex 10), increase comparability and better address greenwashing concerns, compared to the current situation.\n\nThese additional elements do not pre-empt future level 2 rules but are provided as guiding illustrations to help better grasp the contours of the proposed categories and the main elements of the disclosures. Further analysis (such as market analysis and consumer testing) would be needed to set the final details once the level 1 is agreed by co-legislators.\n\n\n\n\nRSB comment version 1: The report does not fully assess a sufficient range of options, including a repeal option. The coherence with the \u2018omnibus 1\u2019 is not sufficiently established\n\n\n\n\nChanges made to the IA: The coherence with the \u2018omnibus 1\u2019 proposals, and more particularly the possible future changes to the CSRD and the EU Taxonomy, is further detailed. This is provided in section 5 setting the stage for and describing the relevant policy options, as well as in Annexes 3 and 6, regarding the assumptions regarding costs underpinning the assessment and the links with other parts of the sustainable finance framework.\n\nThe repeal option has been fully analyzed alongside the other proposed policy options. This is set out in the newly inserted sections 5.1 and 6.1.\n\nAfter more studied consideration of the implications of the \u2018omnibus 1\u2019 proposals as well as the option to repeal the SFDR, the report maintains its conclusions that the preferred options (streamlined product disclosures and creation of 3 categories) are the most aligned with the specific objectives (simplifying and reducing the cost for financial market participants; improving end investors\u2019 ability to understand and compare ESG products). The analysis is further substantiated to demonstrate that a review of the SFDR along these lines, not its repeal, is not only the most effective and efficient way to achieve these objectives but also the most coherent with the reality post-\u2018omnibus 1\u2019 and its practical impacts.\n\n\n\n\nRSB comment version 1: The report is not convincing in terms of the feasibility of providing relevant ESG information partly based on estimates, which would nevertheless allow end investors to make meaningful assessments and comparisons across funds, while at the same time reducing costs and avoiding green washing\n\n\n\n\nChanges made to the IA: The report introduces evidence of the feasibility to set ESG disclosures that would be meaningful and would be based on comparable and credible sustainability information which responds to investors\u2019 demand is of most interest to them (further explained in section 5.2.2 and in Annex 10).\n\nFirst, the report describes the necessary features of the disclosures: (1) building from the existing corporate disclosures under the EU regulatory framework (i.e. CSRD and EU Taxonomy); (2) relying on concepts and metrics which are most commonly available, respond to investors\u2019 demand, and can be externally derived or estimated in case the company is not in scope of the EU regulatory framework. For the latter, the report provides an overview of the state of play of estimation practices and identifies the ESG topics and indicators for which robust estimation has proven to be feasible. The main findings are that the estimation practices on the suggested exclusions are robust and derive from data that is widely available from companies. The focus on more simple and clear ESG indicators and concepts that would need to be estimated should also result in making the estimated disclosures more robust, reliable and comparable, compared to the excessive complexity and disparity in the disclosures today.\n\nSecond, the report presents possible safeguards which could limit the greenwashing concerns around estimations. These consist of transparency obligations on: (1) the proportion of data that was estimated; (2) the possible use of external providers; (3) the implementation of the precautionary principle; (3) the calculation methodology and assumptions.\n\nThese elements are added to the main report (section 5.4) and Annex 8.\n\n\n\n\nRSB comment version 1: The report does not provide sufficient information on the costs associated with different options, including who will bear the costs and who will benefit from savings.\n\n\n\n\nChanges made to the IA: Further details are provided in Annex 3 and in relevant parts of section 6 in the main report of the costs and benefits associated with the options. A more complete overview of the market size for products under the scope of the SFDR is also added in Annex 3 (section 1), together with an overview of academic studies on the benefits of sustainable investment (section 2), to support the findings of consumer studies in Annex 10 illustrating the demand for ESG investment options among investors. Annex 3 and relevant parts of section 6 of the main report also show further breakdowns of these impacts by type of stakeholder (SME vs. larger FMPs), detailed in the overview tables in Annex 3 as well as in its section 3. Further impacts in terms of specific sectors which could be affected by the introduction are included in the analysis of existing market practices in Annex 8 and in Annex 5 (competitiveness check).\n\n\n\n\nRSB comment version 2: The report does not sufficiently assess how the revised SFRD will ensure the comparability between different investment products and the risks related to the use of estimates. The report does not adequately assess the risks of greenwashing.\n\n\n\n\nChanges made to the IA: The discussion introducing options 3.1 and 3.2 in section 5.4 includes additional descriptions and analysis of some of the challenges and limitations in pursuing further comparability beyond that achieved with the proposed criteria. The section also explains further the balance to be struck in relying on data which is available, estimable and of most interest to investors, and the possible risks of greenwashing in overlooking some potentially decision-useful datapoints in the process. This is recalled in section 6.3 in comparing the relative merits of the options.\n\n\n\n\nRSB comment version 2: The options are not sufficiently specified to allow for an assessment and comparison. The report does not fully assess effectiveness, efficiency and coherence of options including the repeal option.\n\n\n\n\nChanges made to the IA: The articulation and relationship between the options is further specified in the introductory part of section 5, section 5.4 explains further what the options set out to achieve in terms balancing between the need for continuity, simplicity and adequate transparency for financial market participants and investors, and the analysis in sections 6.1 and 6.3 is complemented with additional information as recommended by the Board. Section 6.1 addresses why reliance on horizontal consumer protection rules (Unfair Commercial Practices Directive) would be suboptimal for the subject matter covered by the SFDR, and 6.3 discusses how each category can ensure the right information to investors but without overly prescribing investment strategies for financial products and hampering market innovation.\n\n\n\n\nRSB comment version 2: Since the full assessment of policy options depends on level 2 legislation, the report should explain how main alternatives and their impacts will be assessed for such subsequent regulations.\n\n\n\n\nChanges made to the IA: Section 5.4 (Box: Elements to be defined at level 1 vs elements to be defined at level 2) recalls that the key choices will be set in level 1 and it would be premature to anticipate details on any level 2 implementing measures at this stage, which will be impacted by negotiations between co-legislators and are foreseen to be informed by further analysis including of consumer preferences and data availability. The section notes however that those measures would be assessed against their costs and benefits analysis and the preparation would follow better regulation guidelines. As an example, the IA notes that the points picked up by the Board on the usability of specific datapoints regarding adherence to UN and OECD guidance on governance practices would be addressed in level 2.\n\nOther changes in response to comments by the RSB (version 1)\n\n-\nThe analysis of the problems is substantiated with further background of the root causes and other factors that have led to their emergence (in the evaluation, annex 11 to do with the timing of implementation of the existing SFDR, unsolved data availability issues, insufficient sensitivity to genuine investor-needs etc.) and which inform the lessons learned for the review.\n\n-\nFurther detail throughout the report that the requirements underpinning the proposed categories, including the \u2018transition\u2019 category largely favoured in feedback by FMPs and investors, do not constitute major new departures from the status quo but rather codify existing requirements and practice under the ESMA guidelines for fund names, and update and retrofit the requirements of the SFDR to this purpose.\n\n-\nAnalysis to underpin that the proposed new disclosures and categories would constitute a more proportionate regime than the status quo, more consciously geared toward FMPs and investors with an explicit interest in ESG investing (section 5).\n\n-\nFurther analysis showing that the discarded options (soft law/no categories/one category/more than three categories) are suboptimal in meeting the specific and general objectives of the review and at odds with stakeholder feedback (section 5.5).\n\n-\nA discussion on how investment in sovereign bonds could be treated in assessing their potential positive ESG contribution (annex 7), noting that stakeholder feedback on the issue is inconclusive in the absence of comprehensive metrics for measuring public sector ESG performance, and suggesting a preference for their inclusion on an optional or partial basis, subject to additional disclosures.\n\n\u00a0Other changes in response to comments by the RSB (version 2)\n\n-\nBesides information on the trade-offs with estimates added in section 5.4 and 6.3, further assessment is added in sections 5.4 and Annex 8, section 3 on why it is not considered apt to regulate ESG data providers, given the main results of the evaluation, coherence with the overall simplification agenda and for reasons of proportionality.\n\n-\nFurther clarifications are added to the introductory part of section 5, section 5.4 and section 6.3 on the voluntary nature of the revised framework, that this however entails certain restrictions for non-categorised products on how they can be marketed to investors,\u00a0and that the preferred options do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives.\n\n-\nThe option to repeal the SFDR is complemented with details on links to horizontal consumer protection rules in sections 5.2, section 6.1 and Annex 6, section 3, and why reliance on these would likely be suboptimal, as well as further recalling why mere reliance on ESMA fund name guidelines would also be ineffective.\n\n-\nSection 5.4 adds some analysis that the framework will have to evolve over time, should not be overly prescriptive to begin with to prevent this from happening, and that notably research regarding consumer preferences will continue to be important to reflect in level 2 and in future updates of the framework.\n\n4.\nEvidence, sources and quality\n\nThe impact assessment draws on a combination of desk research, a targeted and open public consultation, two Briefings from the Platform for Sustainable Finance (PSF), a joint Opinion from the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), external studies, meetings with stakeholders and other outreach. The material used has been gathered since December 2022, when Commissioner McGuinness announced a comprehensive assessment of the SFDR framework. This material includes but is not limited to the following:\n\n1.\nTargeted 186 and open public 187 consultation: The targeted and open public consultations, held between 14 September 2023 and 22 December 2023,\u00a0were an important part of the assessment announced by Commissioner McGuinness to evaluate potential shortcomings \u2013 focusing on legal certainty, the useability of the regulation and its ability to play its part in tackling greenwashing. The open public consultation was addressed to the general public. The targeted consultation gathered input from public bodies and stakeholders who were more familiar with the SFDR and the EU\u2019s sustainable finance framework. Views were welcome from financial market participants, investors, NGOs, relevant public authorities, national regulators, and others that were subject directly or indirectly to the provisions of the SFDR and/or had more in-depth knowledge and/or (working) experience in the field of sustainable finance disclosures. The consultation provided the Commission with valuable input to inform the review of the SFDR.\n\n2.\nFour technical workshops and roundtables, enabling stakeholders to submit further input.\u00a0The workshops and roundtables complemented the open and targeted consultation,\u00a0enriching the information and the observations received in the consultation.\n\n3.\nTwo Briefings 188 \u00a0 189 from the expert group the Platform for Sustainable Finance (PSF). The Platform for Sustainable Finance (PSF) responded to the Commission\u2019s targeted consultation with a briefing note in December 2023. Further on, the PSF published in December 2024 a briefing note for the Commission outlining how a categorisation system for sustainable finance products could be set up.\n\n4.\nThe joint Opinion from the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) on how to set up categories for financial products 190 .\u00a0The Commission duly considered this joint Opinion by the European Supervisory Authorities (the ESA\u2019s), delivered in June 2024 on their own initiative.\n\n5.\nExternal Studies: the Commission has considered studies from both institutional and academic sources, quoted throughout in this assessment. Inter alia, the Commission considered the views contained in the study requested by the ECON Committee of the European Parliament on \u201cthe current implementation of the SFDR\u201d 191 .\u00a0The Commission also pondered the input provided in \u201cMind the ESG capital allocation gap\u201d, by economists Jan Fichtner, Robin Jaspert and Johannes Petry.\n\n6.\nEngagement with Member States in the context of the Member State Expert Group (December 2024, June 2025), receiving preliminary inputs.\n\n7.\nContinuous engagement with experts on key challenges and on how to set up categories. With a view to address specific issues, the European Commission continuously engaged with experts from the financial industry, NGOs/civil society and academics, as needed.\n\n8.\nFeedback gathered during the Call for Evidence which ran from 2 May to 30 May 2025.\n\nThe material used to inform this impact assessment comes from the market participants as well as other reputable and well-recognised sources. Findings were cross-checked\u00a0across the different information sources to avoid biases caused by outliers or vested interests.\n\n\nAnnex 2: Stakeholder consultation (Synopsis report)\n\n1.\nOverview of consultation activities\n\nIn December 2022, Commissioner Mairead McGuinness announced a comprehensive assessment of the SFDR framework. Since then, the European Commission has conducted extensive consultation activities, addressing all aspects of the proposed legislative review.\n\nThese activities encompassed:\n\n1.\nTwo public consultations that ran from September to December 2023 (targeted 192 \u00a0and open 193 ). A summary report 194 was published in May 2024.\n\n2.\nFour technical workshops and roundtables, enabling stakeholders to submit further input.\n\n3.\nTwo Briefings 195 \u00a0 196 from the expert group the Platform for Sustainable Finance (PSF).\n\n4.\nThe joint Opinion from the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) on how to set up categories for financial products 197 .\n\n5.\nThe Study requested by the ECON Committee of the European Parliament on \u201cthe current implementation of the SFDR\u201d 198 .\n\n6.\nEngagement with Member States in the context of the Member State Expert Group (December 2024, June 2025)\n\n7.\nContinuous engagement with experts on key challenges and on how to set up categories.\n\n8.\nFeedback gathered during the Call for Evidence which ran from 2 May to 30 May 2025.\n\n2.\nStakeholder consultations\n\n2.1.\nTargeted and open public consultations\n\nTwo public consultations, open and targeted, ran from September to December 2023. The open consultation, aimed at the general public, asked about the current requirements of the SFDR and the interaction with other sustainable finance legislation. As the Commission was also interested in exploring possible options to improve the framework and address any potential shortcomings, it also presented a targeted consultation, aimed at experts such as financial market participants, investors, NGOs, relevant public authorities and NCAs inter alia, adding to the questions of the public consultation other queries about potential changes to the disclosure requirements of the SFDR and the potential establishment of a categorisation system for financial products.\n\n324 organisations and individuals participated in the targeted consultation. Financial market participants (FMPs) and financial advisers made up the largest group of respondents (63%, 204 out of 324), primarily consisting of asset management firms (75%), insurance companies (14%), and banks (10%). The second largest group of respondents were NGOs, which constituted 11% (36 out of 324) of the respondents. FMPs and financial advisers who responded to the consultation mostly conduct business for both professional and retail investors (44%) or towards professional investors only (41%), with 14% focusing solely on retail investors. Respondents were predominantly from EU countries, with France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, and Luxembourg being the most represented (23%, 10%, 7%, 6%, and 6%, respectively, totalling 52%). Approximately 19% of respondents were from non-EU countries, predominantly the UK (11%) and the US (5%).\n\n51 respondents provided answers to the open public consultation only. This group consists mainly of FMPs and financial advisers (37.3%, 19 out of 51) and NGOs (15.7%). The greatest number of respondents were from Germany (14%, 7 out of 51), followed by France, Belgium, Romania (12% each), and the UK (10%). Their responses were consistent with the trends observed in the targeted consultation.\n\n2.2.\nTechnical workshops and roundtables\n\nThe European Commission also held a series of technical workshops and roundtables when it issued the consultations on the implementation of the SFDR, allowing stakeholders to provide further comments accompanying the replies to the consultations. The workshops took place in October and December 2023, and January 2024.\n\n2.3.\nTwo opinions from the expert group the Platform for Sustainable Finance (PSF).\n\nThe Platform for Sustainable Finance (PSF) prepared a briefing note in December 2023 to address the main questions raised by the European Commission in the targeted consultation.\n\nFollowing the European Commission\u2019s public consultation, in December 2024 the PSF published a briefing note for the Commission outlining how a categorisation system for sustainable finance products could be set up and calibrated. The briefing note is accompanied by an annex with guidance on setting thresholds and supporting data. The annex shows primary findings on the current state of the ESG markets and the potential impact that setting certain thresholds could have on current products falling under the scope of Article\u00a08 and Article\u00a09 of the\u00a0SFDR. It also provides guidance on steps to determine possible thresholds for\u00a0categories.\n\n2.4.\nThe Opinion from the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) on how to set up categories for financial products.\n\nThe European Supervisory Authorities (the ESA\u2019s), on their own initiative, delivered in June 2024 a joint Opinion on the assessment of the SFDR.\n\n2.5.\nThe Study requested by the ECON Committee of the European Parliament on \u201cthe current implementation of the SFDR\u201d.\n\nThis document was provided in July 2024 by the Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies at the request of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) of the European Parliament. The purpose of the study is to inform the policy debate on sustainability disclosures under the SFDR and provide a legal assessment on possible changes to be brought to relevant legislation in order to improve the framework. The opinions expressed in the study are the sole responsibility of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the European Parliament.\n\n2.6.\nEngagement with Member States in the context of the Member State Expert Group (December 2024, June 2025)\n\nThe European Commission engaged with Member States in the context of the Member State Expert Group in December 2024, receiving preliminary comments.\n\n2.7.\nContinuous engagement with experts on key challenges and on how to set up categories.\n\nThe European Commission engaged continuously with experts such as financial market participants, investors, NGOs, academics and other interested stakeholders, to tackle specific issues.\n\n2.8.\nFeedback gathered during the Call for Evidence which ran from 2 May to 30 May 2025.\n\n195 stakeholders responded to the call for evidence. Businesses associations and companies/businesses made up the largest group of respondents (68,4%). The second largest group of respondents were NGOs, which constituted 9.8% of the responses, followed by national authorities (5.2%). Respondents were predominantly from EU countries, with France, Germany, Belgium, Italy and Netherlands being the most represented (19,7%, 16,1%, 15%, 6,7%, and 5.2%). 14% of respondents were from the UK.\n\n3.\nResults of the stakeholder consultations:\n\n3.1.\nCurrent requirements of the SFDR and interaction with other sustainable finance legislation.\n\nThe consultation showed widespread support for the broad objectives of the SFDR. 89% (272 out of 304 respondents) considered that the objective to strengthen transparency through sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector was still relevant. In addition, 94% (276 out of 294 respondents) totally or mostly agreed that opting for a disclosure framework at the EU level was more effective than national measures at Member State level.\n\nHowever, a wide majority of respondents also highlighted key limitations of the framework such as lack of legal clarity regarding key concepts, limited relevance of certain disclosure requirements and issues linked to data availability. According to many respondents, these limitations had hindered the effectiveness and usability of the framework.\n\nMost notably, 84% (249 out of 296) totally or mostly agreed that the disclosures required by the SFDR are not sufficiently useful to investors, and 82% (247 out of 301) that some of its requirements and concepts are not sufficiently clear. 88% (263 out of 299) totally or mostly agreed that data gaps are making it challenging for FMPs and financial advisers to cope with the SFDR legal requirements. Most respondents agreed that these limitations are currently creating legal uncertainty (79%, 233 out of 296) and posing reputational risks for FMPs and financial advisers (80%, 237 out of 297) as well as risks of greenwashing and mis-selling (81%, 237 out of 294). In addition, a great majority (over 66%) of FMPs and financial advisers (over 66%) considered the current interactions between principal adverse impact (PAI) product and entity level disclosures unclear. In particular, 80% of FMPs face methodological challenges with the requirement to \u2018take account of \u2019the principal adverse impact (PAI) indicators established in the RTS at entity level for the \u2018do no significant harm \u2019(DNSH) test at product level. In addition, 77% found it unclear how FMPs should approach materiality as regards these PAI indicators in the context of product disclosures for DNSH.\n\nWhen asked about issues surrounding data availability, 98% (176 out of 180) of FMPs who responded to these questions said they faced difficulties in obtaining good-quality data, and 53% (90 out of 171) reported engaging to a very large or large extent with investee companies to encourage reporting of the missing data. When asked about the cost of disclosures, 58% (167 out of 287) of total respondents answered that they did not consider it to be proportionate to the benefits generated. This figure increases to 71% (133 out of 186) among FMPs and 6 financial advisers. FMPs and financial advisers indicated that the main components of the costs of disclosures are the costs of personnel and of external advisory services.\n\nFinally, 83% of respondents (245 out of 296) totally or mostly agreed that the SFDR was not being used solely as a disclosure framework as intended but also as a labelling and marketing tool (in particular articles 8 and 9).\n\nAs a result, respondents expressed divided opinions regarding the extent to which the regulation had achieved its objectives during its first years of implementation. For example, A majority (62%, 181 out of 292) said the SFDR had not effectively strengthened protection for end investors or made it easier for them to compare financial products with sustainability claims. A slight majority (52%, 153 out of 294) did not agree that it had successfully directed capital towards investments deemed sustainable, including transitional investments.\n\nThe PSF, for its part, made in its Briefing suggestions to improve the effectiveness and the understanding of ESG and sustainable investment products: to precisely align the product's name, its sustainability marketing claims, declared sustainability contributions, and the actual investment strategy; that the reporting on sustainability performance should cover the entire product, rather than just a portion of it; and when referencing sustainable economic activities, the definitions of environmentally sustainable investments to be exclusively derived from the Taxonomy.\n\nAs regards the interaction with other sustainable finance legislation, the consultation showed consensus on the need to ensure consistency across the wider Sustainable Finance framework: many respondents identified problems with the interactions between the SFDR and the EU Taxonomy, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the sustainability rules under MiFID II and IDD and the EU Climate Benchmarks. These respondents stated that these misalignments led to implementation challenges and operational costs and called for further improvement in the overall coherence of the wider framework.\n\nThe ESAs, in their joint opinion, also concurred that the framework could be improved and that the disclosures to investors in the SFDR may be complex by nature and difficult to understand, in particular for retail investors, as shown by two consumer testing exercises 199 . In addition, the ESAs also noted that, in practice, disclosures had been used by financial market participants to classify their financial products, as \u2018Article 8\u2019 or \u2018Article 9\u2019 products had been used since the outset in marketing material as \u2018quality labels\u2019 for sustainability, consequently posing greenwashing and mis-selling risks.\n\nThe study requested by the ECON Committee concurs with the view that investors, especially retail ones, have little use for most of the information generated under the SFDR. The disclosures are complex and based on concepts that are unfamiliar and unintuitive for them. Moreover, investors would be unable to differentiate the types of funds within Article 8 or Article 9 and may even struggle to differentiate Article 8 and Article 9 products. The study also recognizes that, while the SFDR was conceived as a disclosure regime, in practice it is used instead as a labelling scheme for products, yet with no binding threshold to substantiate the claims, leading to uncertainty and making it hard for investors to assess the veracity of green claims. That, in turn, increases the risk of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d and mis-selling, but also of \u201cgreen bleaching\u201d, i.e., when FMPs choose not to claim environmental, social, and governance (ESG) features for their products to avoid extra costs and legal risks.\n\nThe Study also noted inconsistencies between the SFDR and other Sustainable Finance legislation, signalling for instance inconsistencies with the Taxonomy Regulation, the Benchmarks Regulation exclusions and their relationship with the SFDR\u2019s PAIs, or some problems with corporate reporting under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD): corporates and FMPs may differ about what \u201cmaterial\u201d impacts must be reported, and corporates who struggle to comply with all the CSRD data points may have little incentive to produce information in a form and level of detail enough to let FMPs to comply with their own SFDR-based reporting.\n\nFeedback from the call for evidence very much reflected the previous feedback on the main limitations of the SFDR. The key limitations mentioned included the lack of clarity of the main concepts (i.e. sustainable investment and principal adverse impact); the excessive complexity of the disclosure requirements, the gold-plating practices and the poor comparability across products. As a result, the large majority of responses to the call for evidence suggests that the review should aim at simplifying the framework and definitions, enhance legal certainty and supervisory harmonisation, improve data quality and focus on end-investor understanding.\n\n3.2.\nChanges to the disclosure requirements\n\nEntity level disclosures:\n\nIn the consultation, views on whether the SFDR is the right place to set entity-level disclosure requirements\u00a0for FMPs and financial advisers were split, especially across the different stakeholders \u2019groups. Most FMPs and financial advisers responded that they do not consider the SFDR the right place to include entity-level disclosures 200 , while a majority of NGOs expressed support for having such disclosures in the SFDR 201 . NCAs\u2019 responses were split 202 .\n\nThere was no consensus either regarding the views on the usefulness of the three sets of SFDR entity-level disclosures. Disclosures concerning sustainability risk policies gathered the highest level of support, with 49% (138 out of 280) of respondents finding them \u2018totally\u2019 or \u2018mostly\u2019 useful, while 15% (41 out of 280) responded \u2018not really\u2019 or \u2018not at all\u2019. Opinions were less definitive on disclosures regarding adverse sustainability impacts (31% in support, 31% against) and remuneration policies (39% in support, 26% against).\n\nThose in favour of the existing set of entity-level disclosures stated that they can provide valuable information to investors and civil society, allowing them to assess the sustainability ambition of an FMP and serving as a tool against greenwashing. Those against argued that they are not appropriate or useful to end-investors investing in financial products and reported that investors rarely seek aggregate sustainability-related information at the level of the FMP.\n\nA large majority of respondents called for these disclosure requirements to be simplified and streamlined across the sustainable finance framework. Many expressed concerns about a potential overlap between the transparency requirements on principal adverse impacts under the SFDR and the reporting obligations under the CSRD.\n\nThe PSF in its Briefing recommended assessing to what extent the disclosure of Principal Adverse Impacts (PAIs), at an entity level, could be integrated into CSRD/ESRS disclosures for Financial Market Participants (FMPs) that adhere to both regulations. The Platform believed that conducting a review of the effectiveness of various requirements, simplifying them and prioritising GHG emission reduction targets, progress reporting, taxonomy and transition plans would be beneficial.\n\nThe large majority of the responses to the call for evidence supported the deletion of the entity-level disclosures. Most respondents argued that end-investors are more interested in product-related information and that entity level disclosures should only be mandated under the CSRD, as per the new scope proposed by the omnibus. However, a small minority was in favour of retaining the entity-level disclosures while streamlining them in view of the reduction of data points under the CSRD.\n\nProduct level disclosures:\n\nThe consultation sought stakeholder views on potential changes to the product level disclosures, specifically on whether the framework should impose uniform requirements for all or for some financial products (e.g. products whose asset under management exceed a certain threshold to be defined, or products intended solely for retail investors) regardless of their sustainability-related claims, and whether additional disclosure requirements should be required from financial products that make sustainability-related claims. 56% of respondents (161 out of 288) agreed \u2018to a very large\u2019 or \u2018large extent\u2019 that the EU should impose uniform disclosure requirements for all financial products offered in the EU, regardless of their sustainability claims. 31% (88 out of 288) of respondents expressed the opposite view. Supporters of this measure, which were present throughout all stakeholders\u2019 groups (for example, 50% of FMPs and financial advisers support such disclosures), argued that it would enable a level playing field, avoiding that sustainable products are disadvantaged by more reporting burdens and costs. Some also argued that it would enhance transparency and comparability, allowing investors to make better informed choices. Those against argued that it would impose unnecessary costs on products without sustainability claims and could confuse investors with information that may not be aligned with a product\u2019s investment strategy, raising the risk of greenwashing. When asked about what these disclosures should be, a large majority of respondents answered that they should be restricted to key meaningful indicators that are comparable across different markets and asset classes and easily understandable for retail investors. Respondents mostly mentioned climate, diversity and human rights as topics to be covered by the disclosures. Many respondents also argued that metrics on transition should be added. Conversely, some respondents, mainly from the NGO sector, suggested that there should be a comprehensive set of disclosures which could include the mandatory PAIs, alignment with the EU Taxonomy, percentage of investments in undertakings with a science-based transition plan, exclusions and engagement.\n\nIn the consultation it was shown that there was less support for imposing uniform disclosure requirements for some financial products, regardless of their sustainability related claims (e.g. products whose assets under management exceed a certain threshold to be defined, or products intended solely for retail investors), with 62% (172 out of 277) of respondents not agreeing at all, or only agreeing to a limited extent. The distribution of responses is similar across all stakeholder groups. Most respondents expressed concerns that it would make sustainability performance comparison impossible and would make the disclosure framework more complex and confusing. Many have also flagged that it would be challenging to define a subset of financial products that would need to fall within the scope of these disclosures.\n\nAdditionally, 55% (152 out of 274) of respondents agreed that products making sustainability claims should provide additional disclosures to support their claims to ensure credibility and prevent greenwashing. While there was no clear consensus about what these qualitative and quantitative disclosures should be, the most cited ones include: sustainability objectives, sustainable investment strategy and associated binding and measurable KPIs, minimum standards of good governance, percentage of sustainable investments and Taxonomy-alignment, decarbonisation targets, percentage of undertakings having a transition plan, applied exclusions, engagement and voting policies and PAIs. Some respondents argued that such disclosures should be set in a flexible manner to align with diverse product investment strategies and to accommodate innovation and evolving market standards. On the other hand, others were of the view that these disclosures should be set by the regulators and be identical for all financial products with sustainability claims.\n\nLastly, many respondents stressed the importance of aligning these disclosures with potential future product categories and minimum criteria under the revised SFDR framework and argued that any changes to the SFDR disclosures would need to be reflected in the MiFID and IDD sustainability preferences rules.\n\nOn the other hand, the PSF in its Briefing in December 2023 underlined the importance of PAI disclosure on product level, in particular for products that consider PAIs under Article 7 of the SFDR.\n\nThe Platform also proposed a streamlined approach to disclosures, recommending a set of pre-contractual disclosures and a single set of periodic reporting disclosures.\n\nDisclosures should focus on key information, accommodating multi-option products by utilising website disclosure for additional details, such as individual PAI indicators.\n\nThe Platform envisioned the integration of the Taxonomy into the periodic reporting of any financial product in the future.\n\nOver the long term, the Platform advocated mandatory minimum ESG reporting requirements, including GHG emissions and the Taxonomy, across all financial products.\n\nLastly, the Platform underscored the importance of distinguishing between pre-contractual commitments and periodic reporting, claiming that the former entails product restrictions while the latter provides information on the current investments of the product.\n\nAs regards the ESAs, in their joint Opinion published in June 2024 they recommended the Commission to ensure that sustainability disclosures catered to different investor needs, and improvements in sustainability disclosures took into account different distribution channels, including digital ones, and ensured consistency of information provided. The Commission should prioritise only essential information for retail investors while professional investors may benefit from more detailed information. The ESAs encouraged the Commission to carefully reflect on whether to include other products in the SFDR scope to ensure harmonised disclosures for both products currently in the scope of SFDR and any other products that could be brought into the scope. Furthermore, information on key adverse impact indicators could be considered for all financial products, based on a cost-benefit analysis justifying the introduction of such requirement; and the ESAs also suggested that the Commission could evaluate the introduction of a framework to assess the sustainability features of government bonds, taking into account the specificities of that asset class.\n\nFor its part, the Study requested by the ECON Committee considers that SFDR disclosures should work seamlessly with other disclosure rules. In general, the information pipeline (including corporate reporting under the CSRD, indexes under the Benchmarks Regulation, and reporting under the SFDR) needs to be streamlined. A more widespread reporting of PAIs, covering more products, is needed, but calibrated between sustainable or impact products, transition products, and general products with no sustainability features. The Study claims that the streamlining of rules and the expansion of their scope, would derive considerable benefit from more emphasis, in parallel, on FMPs\u2019 methodologies, technology and tools to process the information. Authorities that play a constructive role in developing such methodologies and tools could be more prescriptive in their expectations, while reducing (some) FMPs\u2019 dependence on \u201cinfomediaries\u201d, regulated (index and ESG Ratings providers) or not (e.g., other data providers).\n\nThe call for evidence signalled that a large majority of stakeholders across the board welcome considerable simplifications to product level disclosures (for example by limiting the number of pages for the pre-contractual document to 2 to 3 pages), focusing on key information for investors regarding e.g. the potential classification of a product and adherence to associated criteria (see below), its main sustainability-linked objectives and strategy, and KPIs for measuring performance. In addition, most respondents stressed the need to add a reference to the category in the PRIIPs KIID. Most respondents also indicated that disclosures of sustainability risks remain useful, including for products currently falling under Article 6 (i.e. or non-categorised products).\n\n3.3.\nCategorisation for financial products\n\nIn the consultation, strong support for a voluntary categorisation system regulated at the EU level was expressed: a large majority of respondents (72%, 205 out of 284) totally or mostly disagreed with the idea that simply disclosing sustainability information was enough, indicating the need to set up an EU categorisation system for financial products. While the distribution of responses was similar across different stakeholder groups, respondents belonging to or representing the three financial services sectors (insurance, asset management and banking sector) had a slightly different view as regards the benefits of product categories for investors: 42% (11 out of 26) of respondents belonging to or representing the insurance sector totally or mostly agree that a categorisation system would improve understanding among professional investors, compared to 73% (104 out of 143) and 76% (13 out of 17) in the asset management and banking sectors, respectively. Similarly, 50% (13 out of 26) of the insurance sector respondents believed a categorisation system would help retail investors, compared to 84% (120 out of 143) and 76% (13 out of 17) in the asset management and banking sectors, respectively.\n\n61% (163 out of 268) of respondents agreed that the SFDR is the appropriate legal instrument to deal with the accuracy and fairness of marketing communications and the use of sustainability related names for financial products, 19% (51 out of 268) disagreed and the remainder were unsure. In addition, 69% (192 out of 279) of respondents totally or mostly agreed that the introduction of product categories should be accompanied by specific rules on how market participants must label and communicate on their products. Several stakeholders raised timing concerns regarding the ESMA guidelines for fund names and the regulatory coherence with a potential new product categorisation system.\n\nThe consultation asked about two proposed approaches to a potential EU categorisation system: whether such categories should be based on new criteria (not related to existing concepts under the SFDR) (approach 1), or if Articles 8 and 9 should be converted into formal product categories by clarifying and adding criteria to support the already existing concepts (approach 2). Respondents showed no clear preference: results indicated a slight preference for the first approach, with 50% (145 out of 293) of respondents totally or mostly agreeing and 23% (66 out of 293) totally or mostly disagreeing. The distribution of responses varied among the different types of respondents. Notably, the majority of respondents belonging or representing NCAs and the asset management sector supported the approach 1, while most respondents from the insurance sector strongly disagreed with it and favoured an approach based on existing concepts. The views of respondents representing the banking sector were divided. The majority of respondents in favour of approach 1 highlighted the limitations in the current framework and argued that the existing concepts could not cater for, or differentiate between, the wide range of ESG strategies in the market. Many also stated that the current terms were not adequate for retail investors. They also argued that new categories could allow for a potential alignment with other national regimes. Conversely, most respondents in favour of approach 2 argued that the SFDR already provided the necessary elements for sustainability assessments and disclosures and expressed concerns about regulatory stability and the associated costs of switching to a different system, which would be transferred to end-investors.\n\nDespite diverging views on the approach to be taken, many respondents indicated that they would support a hybrid approach combining established SFDR concepts with a voluntary categorisation framework. Irrespective of the chosen approach, most respondents emphasised the importance of the categories being focused on retail investors, incorporating international frameworks, and leveraging existing national labels.\n\nAlthough opinions differed on the approach to be taken, commonly agreed principles for the categories and underlying criteria emerged among respondents: (1) Retail investors-focused: A large majority of respondents stressed the importance of categories being easily understandable by retail investors. They called for simple and comparable disclosures to help retail investors grasp the products\u2019 investment goals, strategies used to achieve them, and ESG performance monitoring. (2) International dimension: While acknowledging that full alignment with third countries\u2019 categorisation systems may not be feasible, most respondents urged the European approach to allow for international applicability. (3) Integrating the concept of transition finance: There is overwhelming support (72% of respondents) for creating a specific category for products with a transition focus, aiming to improve the sustainability profile of the assets they invest in. (4) Asset-neutral criteria: Respondents highlighted the need for underlying criteria to be asset-neutral and applicable to all types of financial products.\n\nThe Platform also advocated in its first Briefing in December 2023 for the introduction of a common categorisation scheme to address the existing fragmentation and confusion in the European market. The Platform suggested that such categorisation:\n\n\u00b7\nShould be structured in such a way to be easily understood by retail investors and used to address sustainability preferences.\n\n\u00b7\nShould avoid the impression that one product\u2019s processes are ranked better than another\u2019s (e.g. 'best in class\u2019 better than 'engagement' or vice versa), whereas a ranking according to the extent of transparency (e.g. Article 9 or 8) appeared suitable from a precautionary principle perspective.\n\n\u00b7\nShould only be based on a thorough analysis of the intended use, how to ensure clarity of categorisation, proper evaluation of the impact of such categorisation as well as an analysis whether it should be mandatory or optional. In addition, it should be analysed whether the categorisation should be based on committed elements or actual elements of a product.\n\nThe ESAs, in their joint Opinion, made some recommendations to the Commission regarding the potential categorisation of financial products. In this vein, the Commission could consider the introduction of a product classification system based on regulatory categories and/or sustainability indicator(s) 203 to help consumers navigate the broad selection of sustainable products and support the full transition to sustainable finance. The categories should be simple with clear objective criteria or thresholds to identify which category the product falls into. The ESAs encouraged, at least, categories of \u2018sustainability\u2019 and \u2018transition\u2019. The options for product categorisation and /or sustainability indicator(s) should be consumer tested and consulted on. With clear product categories and/or sustainability indicator(s), sustainability disclosures would not need to be as detailed and extensive.\n\nIn the Study requested by the ECON Committee, the authors concur that product names, categories or \u201clabels\u201d are useful. However, they believe that article 8 and article 9 should not be transformed into categories, as they are too complex and unintuitive for investors. Instead, a new system, with new categories should be established. In light of investor preferences, market structure, and policy priorities, they consider that the new categories should include \u201cimpact\u201d products and \u201ctransition\u201d (in the sense of transition facilitating) products. The inclusion of \u201ctransition\u201d products would make it possible for investors to choose products that, while not making investments that are sustainable, have a clear aim to bring measurable improvements to the sustainability profile of the assets invested in. Furthermore, a \u201csustainable\u201d products category, though promising would need more precision. Clearer product categories would make the information more usable for investors, helping with both \u201cgreenwashing\u201d and \u201cgreen bleaching\u201d, under certain conditions. First, all these categories should be based on consumer testing, both beforehand and ex post, to ensure that the categories work as intended. Second, products \u201cnames\u201d need to be considered together with mechanisms that ensure measurability and accountability. Third, there should be more emphasis on market analysis, to ensure that the categories encompass a sufficiently large part of the market, and to track whether they help FMPs improve their sustainability features.\n\nThe Platform on Sustainable Finance (PSF), in its second Briefing presented in December 2024, strongly supported establishing a categorisation scheme that benefitted retail investors, and which would be usable for all investors. The proposal took consideration of the need for a smooth transition from the existing disclosure regime. The Platform recommended categorising products with the following sustainability strategies:\u00a0\n\n\u00b7\nSustainable: Contributions through Taxonomy-aligned Investments or Sustainable Investments with no significant harmful activities, or assets based on a more concise definition consistent with the EU Taxonomy.\n\n\u00b7\nTransition: Investments or portfolios supporting the transition to net zero and a sustainable economy, avoiding carbon lock-ins, in line with the European Commission's recommendations on facilitating finance for the transition to a sustainable economy.\n\n\u00b7\nESG collection: Excluding significantly harmful investments/activities, investing in assets with better environmental and/or social criteria or applying various sustainability features.\n\nAll other products would be identified as unclassified products.\n\nThe PSF argued that the proposal, to be effective, requires aligning sustainability preferences with the categories. Investors and advisors should easily identify the products that match sustainability preferences, supported by mandatory disclosures that facilitate the alignment. The categorisation of products should reflect the sustainability strategy employed in constructing each financial product.\n\nThe Platform recommended evaluating whether the scope of the categorisation should go beyond the current SFDR, considering whether all products and services under sustainability preferences in IDD/MiFID should be categorised. Furthermore, the Platform recommended to develop a common understanding on impact investing in the EU sustainable finance framework and how it relates to the EU Taxonomy (Taxonomy) and, subsequently, determine how to integrate it in the categorisation scheme.\n\nThe categorisation scheme should be grounded in the sustainability strategy of the financial product and align with an investor's values or impact objectives. Investors' sustainability values should be identified through their preferences, enabling a clear match with available products. Pre-contractual product disclosures would assist in identifying suitable options, while regular reporting should keep investors informed about the sustainability performance of their chosen products. All types of products and services relevant for IDD/MiFID sustainability preferences should be able to be classified within the scheme. Furthermore, investment options that today do not fall under SFDR should be able to demonstrate that they fulfil the category criteria and are then classified accordingly.\n\nCategories should have precise minimum criteria, clearly defined objectives, and measurable KPIs. Products within these categories should measure and disclose their sustainability performance.\n\nThe PSF argued that the categorisation scheme proposed addressed SFDR disclosure issues such as the challenges related to inappropriate use of SFDR disclosure requirements. It aims at mitigating fragmentation due to varying national labelling regimes and different interpretations by National Competent Authorities (NCAs), auditors, and lawyers. The scheme should facilitate investment flows and sustainable economic growth by preventing fragmentation, which affects the passporting regime for investment products.\n\nThe PSF acknowledged that the proposal remained high-level, but it should serve as a basis from which to build a complete and detailed categorisation scheme. The proposal requires further development to define or refine thresholds based on real world testing.\n\nThe call for evidence confirmed a very large support for creating categories. Most respondents expressed support for creating 3 categories (sustainable, transition, and other ESG), while a small minority preferred 2 categories (sustainable and transition). A small portion of stakeholders also expressed interest for a standalone impact category, while acknowledging that impact products could also fall under the sustainable or transition category and disclose how they conduct impact investing.\n\nThe responses to the call for evidence also showed a general agreement regarding the need to align the criteria with the ESMA guidelines (i.e. the PAB and CTB exclusions). Many have also urged the Commission to ensure that the criteria will be adapted to all types of asset classes, while underlying that certain assets classes (such as derivatives, real estates and sovereigns) and facing considering challenges under the current rules. Stakeholders from the insurance and pension sectors have urged to ensure that the criteria would fit their sectoral specificities.\n\nFinally, a majority of respondents called for due consideration of the changes expected under the omnibus proposals, and the need to reflect potential categories in product distribution rules namely under MiFID and IDD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnex 3: Who is affected and how?\n\n1.\nPractical implications of the initiative\n\nThis initiative addresses the following problem drivers identified in the evaluation and problem definition:\n\n\u00b7\nUnclear lengthy and complex disclosure requirements and ESG concepts\n\n\u00b7\nMisalignments and duplication with other sustainable finance rules\n\n\u00b7\nLack of ESG data and insufficient guidance of estimations\n\n\u00b7\nDisclosure articles (Art. 8 and 9) used as categorisation while not being fit for that purpose\n\nIt intends to address those problems by the following combination of preferred options:\n\n\u00b7\nOption 1.2: Deletion of entity-level disclosures\n\n\u00b7\nOption 2.2: Significantly reduce product-level disclosures\n\n\u00b7\nOption 3.1: introduction of categorisation system with 3 categories (sustainable, transition and other ESG).\n\nThis initiative will have impacts on the following groups of stakeholders:\n\n\u00b7\nFinancial market participants (including SMEs): are bearing the cost of implementing the SFDR as well as potential future policy options to further develop the SFDR framework. A significant share of financial market participants are SMEs.\n\n\u00b7\nNon-financial businesses: can benefit from the SFDR provisions if they are performing activities that are classified as sustainable or not harmful from an environmental, social or governance perspective and can have easier access to finance by disclosing sustainability information.\n\n\u00b7\nCitizens: Would benefit from the SFDR revision by receiving in the future sustainability information for financial products in a simpler format giving higher transparency, a clearer and more visible differentiation and assuring minimum quality standards by introducing safeguards that should mitigate greenwashing risks, increase trust and confidence in such products.\n\n\u00b7\nPublic administrations will have one-off efforts to familiarise themselves with the updated SFDR rules. These largely follow market practices in the wake of the ESMA guidelines and are they are expected to benefit in the long-term from clearer rules and simpler disclosures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\nSummary of costs and benefits\n\nTable 1: Overview of costs and benefits identified in the evaluation\n\nMeasure\n\n\t\n\nBR Type of cost or benefit*\n\n\t\n\nGroup Affected**\n\n\t\n\nFrequency\n\n\t\n\nAmount\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nRequirement to publish entity level disclosures\n\n\t\n\nDirect benefit\n\n\t\n\nCitizens that are retail investors and Businesses acting as professional investors\n\n\t\n\nRecurrent\n\n\t\n\nqualitative\n\n\t\n\nEntity-level disclosures of FMPs provide information on their policies on integrating sustainability risks, how they consider principal adverse impacts on sustainability factors, and how their remuneration policies align with sustainability objectives.

The SFDR requires an enhanced level of disclosure. The nature and extent of these disclosure requirements under the regulation depend on the characteristics of products.\n\nThe table below summarises the estimated number of entities affected by the SFDR and their product volume. It is decomposed into the insurance & pension funds, banks and investment firms and investment fund sectors. For the product volume of those sectors, it is important to note that there are overlaps as insurance companies, investment firms as well as banks can invest into funds shares/units and/or provide asset management services. According to EFAMA the total volume of Assets under Management in the scope of SFDR is estimated at about EUR 16 trillion (end 2023), of which about EUR 12 trillion are reported in the database Morningstar that serves as the universe of assets, for which information on the fund volume and SFDR classification was available.\n\nSector\n\n\t\n\nTypes of entities\n\n\t\n\nTotal CEPS 211\n\n(2020)\n\n\t\n\nUpdated value (2025)\n\n\t\n\nEstimated product volume\n\n\t\n\no/w in Morningstar\n\n\n\n\nInsur-ance\n\n\t\n\nInsurance companies making available IBIPs\n\n\t\n\n778\n\n\t\n\n772\n\n\t\n\nCIU Investment from in unit-or index linked contracts: EUR\u00a01.5\u00a0trn4\n\nCIU investment from profit-linked contract EUR\u00a01:5 trn4\n\n\t\n\nCIU Investment from in unit-or index linked contracts: EUR\u00a01.1\u00a0trn4 (75,9%)\n\nCIU investment from profit-linked contract EUR\u00a00.3 trn4 (18,9%)\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nInstitutions for occupational retirement provisions - IORPs\n\n\t\n\n5 669\n\n\t\n\n5 5902\n\n\t\n\nConsolidated asset value IORPS\n\nEUR 2.7 trn\n\n\t\n\nEUR\u00a00.5\u00a0trn (17,9%)\n\n\n\n\nBanks\n\n\t\n\nCredit Institutions providing Portfolio Management\n\n\t\n\n2 137\n\n\t\n\n236\n\n(consolidating entities with several activities)\n\n\t\n\n-\nEUR 11.1 trn3 AuM (managed by 201 entities)\n\n-\nEUR 4.2 trn3 Customer resources distributed but not managed (153 entities)\n\n-\nEUR 0.82 trn3 (overseen by 60 entities)\n\n\t\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\nInvestment firms\n\n\t\n\nInvestment Firms\n\n\t\n\n5 778\n\n\t\n\n5 9231\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nInvestment funds\n\n\t\n\nAlternative investment funds - AIF\n\n\t\n\n1 987\n\n\t\n\n3 1121\n\n\t\n\nAssets of investment funds in scope of the SFDR are estimated at about EUR 16 trillion (End 2023).6\n\n\t\n\nAbout EUR 0.9 trn of alternative investment funds are shown in Morningstar including 3\u00a0950 products from at least 279 issuers.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nVenture capital funds - EuVECA\n\n\t\n\n115\n\n\t\n\n3871\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nSocial entrepreneurship funds - EuSEF\n\n\t\n\n6\n\n\t\n\n161\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nUCITS\n\n\t\n\n1 139\n\n\t\n\n1 3301\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\nAbout EUR 12 trn of UCITS are shown in Morningstar inc. 25\u00a0690 products from at least 871 issuers. 8\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nTotal\n\n\t\n\n17 609\n\n\t\n\n17 544\n\n\t\n\nProduct volume not additive due to overlaps in the financial sector\n\n\t\n\nNotes to the table:\n\n1 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 https://registers.esma.europa.eu/publication/searchRegister?core=esma_registers_upreg\n\n2 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 https://register.eiopa.europa.eu/registers/register-of-insurance-undertakings\n\n3 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EBA FINREP data as off Q1 2025.

All products which do not meet these criteria are disclosed under Article 6, and often considered as \u2018other\u2019 products.\n\n1.\nArticle 8 products consider or promote environmental or social characteristics in the pursuit of\u00a0other financial objectives.\n\n2.\nArticle 9 products seek to make a positive impact on society or the environment through sustainable investment and have a non-financial objective at the core of their offering.\n\nThe following graph shows the evolution of Article 8, Article 9 and other funds since Q2 2021.\n\nSource: Morningstar\n\nHistorical development: The total market size for EU funds is fluctuating around EUR 9.1 trillion since Q2 2021 with Art. 8 Funds averaging EUR 5.2 trillion (57%), Art. 9 funds 0.3 trillion (3%) and other 3.6 trillion (40%).\n\n2. Benefits linked to the SFDR regulation\n\n2.1. Transparency for investors to understand and compare ESG characteristics\n\nWhile the two main specific objectives of this legislative review are 1) an increase of transparency, i.e. the improvement of end-investors\u2019 ability to understand and compare sustainability-linked financial products as well as 2) a low administrative burden for the provision of such transparency, i.e. simplifying and reducing the sustainability-related administrative requirements of the framework for financial market participants, there are further impacts that go beyond these objectives. The following graph illustrates potential objectives that go beyond the cost-effective provision of transparency (outside the dotted box) as proposed in the academic literature.\n\nSource: K\u00f6lbel et al (2020) 212 \u00a0complemented by own analysis.\n\nTo put the legislative review of the SFDR into such a broader context, the paragraphs below provide scientific evidence for 1) investors demand for transparency as well as 2) indications of real-world impacts linked to sustainable investment.\n\n2.2. Investor demand for information on ESG characteristics\n\nAs also shown in Annex 10, investors increasingly demand that their investments not only yield financial returns, but also social and environmental returns. More and more economic papers provide evidence for this, e.g.:\n\n\u00b7\nHartzmark and Susmann (Do investors value sustainability? A natural experiment examining ranking and fund flows, The Journal of Finance 74 (6), 2789-2837) show in a natural experiment approach based on Morningstar mutual fund data that when a fund's sustainability rating improved (e.g. from one \u2018globe\u2019 to five \u2018globes\u2019), it experienced a positive net flow of funds.\u00a0Conversely, a decrease in a sustainability rating led to net outflows.\n\n\u00b7\nBarber, Brad M., Adair Morse, and Ayako Yasuda, 2021 (Impact investing, Journal of Financial Economics 139 (1), 162-185) document that investors derive nonpecuniary utility from investing in dual-objective VC funds, thus sacrificing returns. They show both that they ex ante (in random utility/willingness-to-pay (WTP) models) accept 2.5-3.7 percentage points of lower internal rates of return for impact funds and ex post actually earn 4.7 percentage points (ppts) lower internal rates of return as compared to traditional VC funds.\n\n\u00b7\nBauer, R., Ruof T., and Smeets P, 2021: (\"Get real! Individuals prefer more sustainable investments\", Review of Financial Studies 34 (8), 3976\u20134043) run two field surveys (n = 1,669, n = 3,186) with a pension fund that grants its members a real vote on its sustainable-investment policy. Participants\u2019 strong social preferences are demonstrated by a high demand reflected in two-thirds of participants are willing to expand the fund\u2019s engagement with companies based on selected sustainable development goals, even when they expect engagement to hurt financial performance. Support remains strong after the fund implements the choice.\n\n\u00b7\nHeeb, K\u00f6lbel, Paetzold, Zeisberger (2022): Do Investors care about impact? : The paper assesses how investors\u2019 willingness-to-pay (WTP) for sustainable investments responds to the social impact of those investments, using a framed field experiment. While investors have a substantial WTP for sustainable investments, they do not pay significantly more for more impact. This also holds for dedicated impact investors. When investors compare several sustainable investments, their WTP responds to relative, but not to absolute, levels of impact. Regardless of investments\u2019 impact, investors experience positive emotions when choosing sustainable investments. The findings suggest that the WTP for sustainable investments is primarily driven by an emotional, rather than a calculative, valuation of impact. (JEL D62, G11, G41, Q56)\n\nThe European Security Markets Authority (ESMA) identifies in a recent study 213 covering both UCITS and Alternative Investment Funds that the proportion of funds with ESG-related names increased significantly from less than 3% before 2015 to about 9% by mid-2024.\u00a0Fund names are most likely the first piece of information investors encounter about a fund and are thus a crucial signal of the fund\u2019s strategy and aims. Therefore, the authors analyse in a panel event study the impact of adding ESG terms to a fund\u2019s name on funds flows. The results indicate that adding an ESG term has a significant impact on fund inflows during the five quarters following the name change with a cumulative increase in inflows over the first-year amounting to 8.9%.\n\nWhile the results above, together with the findings in Annex 10, provide clear and quantifiable indications of investor demand for ESG information and also a change in the pattern of capital flows linked to higher transparency, the objective of the review of the SFDR aims in the first place to increase the quality of such transparency for investors and their ability to understand and compare ESG characteristics (specific objective 2). As the degree of understandability of such information can only be established once the technical details of the disclosures will be fixed, which will take more time and will be performed at level 2 accompanied by dedicated market and consumer studies that will help to develop the disclosures in a way that is most consumer-friendly, the exact benefit of an increased transparency cannot be measured or quantified at this stage. As such the benefit would result from a higher precision, showing ideally ESG information in a reliable manner (i.e. avoiding greenwashing) and making sure that it is correctly understood and integrated into the investment decision. This will help allocating capital in line with the preferences of investors, instead of allocating it either to companies that pretend to score high on ESG topics (greenwashing) or that are misrepresented to perform well on ESG due to a misinterpretation of unduly complex ESG disclosures.\n\n2.3. Real world impacts including the transition\n\nThe ultimate objective of providing transparency on ESG information for financial investments translates also into a real-world impact that is expected to materialise through additional investment into technology that improves the environmental, social or governance characteristics of companies. While this goes also beyond the scope of this impact assessment, we provide here examples to put the impact assessment into a broader context and to show the big picture evidence from the academic literature on real-world impacts:\n\n\u00b7\nThe \"Platform on Sustainable Finance report: Monitoring Capital Flows to Sustainable Investments\" aims to provide insights into how capital is being allocated towards sustainable investments within the European Union. The report focuses on tracking and measuring the capital flows directed toward environmentally sustainable economic activities (aligned with the EU Taxonomy). Specifically, Taxonomy-aligned CapEx reported in 2023 increased from EUR 186 billion in 2022 to EUR 250 billion in 2023. This represents an additional investment of EUR 64 billion in Taxonomy-aligned activities year-on-year. 214\n\nThere is also evidence that establishes a link between sustainable investments and real-world outcomes beyond the EU, e.g. the reduction of CO2 emissions:\n\n\u00b7\nIn a paper published in 2023 the authors Bakry et al. investigate the relationship between green finance and environmental performance in 76 developing countries from 2010 to 2019.\u00a0The study finds that green finance and renewable energy significantly reduce carbon emissions, emphasizing their importance for environmental sustainability. Additionally, the research confirms the Environmental Kuznets Curve, indicating that CO2 emissions initially increase with economic growth but eventually decline, and it highlights the rise in emissions due to urbanization. The findings suggest policy recommendations to further promote green finance and renewable energy to enhance environmental performance in developing regions 215 .\n\n\u00b7\nThe authors Huang et al. explore the impact of green finance on green innovation in China\u2019s provinces from 2009 to 2017 in their 2022 published paper \u201cimpacts of green finance on green innovation: A spatial and non-linear perspective\u201d. The study finds a significant positive correlation between green finance and green innovation. Both direct and indirect effects of green finance positively influence green innovation locally and in neighbouring areas. However, the effectiveness of green finance decreases as environmental regulation intensity rises. The study suggests leveraging the broader influence of green finance and green innovation to balance regional sustainable development while maintaining appropriate regulation levels 216 .\n\n\u00b7\nIn a paper published in 2023 the authors Udeagha and Muchapondwa examine the role of green finance and financial technology (fintech) in advancing environmental sustainability in the BRICS region from 1990 to 2020, highlighting the challenge of reducing reliance on fossil fuels and the region's untapped renewable energy potential. It finds that green finance, fintech, and energy innovation support carbon neutrality goals, while natural resources rent and economic growth impair environmental quality, aligning with the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis. The study identifies bidirectional causality between CO2 emissions and green finance, fintech, and natural resources rent, with unidirectional causality from GDP and energy innovation to emissions. The paper recommends that BRICS nations enhance green financial products and expand green credit opportunities to promote sustainability 217 .\n\n\u00b7\nIn their 2025 published paper \u201cResearch on the impact of green finance on regional carbon emission reduction and its role mechanisms\u201d the authors Li et al. examine how green finance policy facilitates the transition to a low-carbon economy in China, analysing 270 cities from 2010 to 2021 using the double debiased machine learning model. It finds that green finance significantly reduces regional carbon emissions by supporting green technology innovation and optimizing industrial structures. The effects are more pronounced in the eastern region and non-resource-based cities compared to central and western regions and resource-dependent cities. Additionally, policies like \"Broadband China,\" information consumption pilots, and big data zones enhance the impact of green finance on emission reductions. The study provides insights and policy support for leveraging green finance to advance sustainable economic development 218 .\n\n\u00b7\nThe authors Meo and Karim investigated the relationship between green finance and CO2 emissions in the top ten economies supporting green finance in their paper \u201cThe role of green finance reducing CO2emissions: An empirical analysis\u201d published in 2022. This research confirms that green finance generally reduces CO2 emissions, though the impact varies based on market conditions and country-specific circumstances. The findings suggest that green finance is an effective financial strategy for decreasing CO2 emissions, with its effects influenced by variations in market conditions and the specific contexts of each country 219 .\n\n\u00b7\nIn a 2024 published study Meryem Filiz Bast\u00fcrk explores the impact of green finance on carbon emissions globally, in light of increased environmental awareness through frameworks like the sustainable development goals and the Paris Agreement. Using the system generalized method of moments, she analyses data from 48 countries between 2017 and 2022. The findings demonstrate that green finance, particularly through green bonds, significantly reduces carbon emissions, with a 1% increase in green bonds leading to a 0.012% decrease in emissions 220 .\n\n3. Description of respondent sample with cost information\n\nOne of the two specific objectives of the SFDR review is keeping the administrative burden for providers of financial products in check. Hence, it is important to establish first a baseline that shows an estimate of the administrative burden linked to the SFDR in the EU.\n\n3.1. Source of information\n\nAs outlined in Annex 2, the Commission performed a targeted stakeholder consultation on the SFDR in the period 14 September 2023 - 22 December 2023. As part of this consultation, respondents were asked to report their one-off and recurrent costs related to SFDR disclosures.\n\n3.2. One-off and recurrent costs\n\nWhat is meant by one-off and recurrent costs? One-off costs are costs that are incurred only once by businesses that need to adapt to a new or amended piece of legislation or regulation. In the context of the SFDR they cover internal and external costs of financial market participants and financial advisers (or consolidated groups of such entities) for familiarising themselves with the new regulatory landscape and for updating internal processes and IT-systems accordingly. Recurrent costs occur after the one-off adaptation process is finished and cover annual costs for product and entity level disclosures. While a new product launch involves also certain one-off costs from a product perspective (e.g. registration, development of marketing material, preparation of pre-contractual disclosures, etc.), these costs are classified as recurrent from an entity perspective as new products are launched on a recurring basis, e.g. every year.\n\n3.3. Administrative and substantive compliance costs\n\nFrom a better regulation perspective, the one-off and recurrent costs are classified as administrative costs as the SFDR is a disclosure regime and the costs are linked to information obligations. Hence no additional compliance costs linked to changes in core business functions (beyond reporting and disclosure) apply for the SFDR.\n\n3.4 Description of respondent sample\n\nIn total 17 respondents provided both one-off and recurring costs of SFDR disclosures.\n\nThe costs reported had to be decomposed to entity level and product level disclosures. For each respondent, the total reported costs were split in accordance with the reported entity-product level split. On average respondents reported spending about 74 percent for product level and 26 percent for entity level disclosures. 221 \u00a0\n\nFigure 1: Overview of replies\n\nNumber of respondents\n\n\t\n\nSize\n\n\t\n\nAUM million EUR\n\n\t\n\nSust.

Initial analysis of cost sample\n\nAn analysis by size has shown that there are strong fixed cost degression effects, meaning that large financial market participants spend significantly lower percentages of their AUM on SFDR disclosures.\n\nIf both the cost information in % of AuM and the AuM were plotted on a logarithmic scale, an approximately linear relationship could be established. This means, moving for one unit on the x-axis, i.e. increasing the AuM by a factor of 10, led on average to a decrease of the costs expressed as a share of AuM by about 2/3rds or 67%. E.g. if an asset manager with EUR 40\u00a0000 million of AUM has costs of 7%, the costs decrease by about 2/3rd to about 2% if the asset manager grows by a factor of 10, i.e. to EUR 400\u00a0000 million of AuM.\n\nFigure 2: Recurring entity level costs\n\na=\n\n\t\n\n-2.68050985\n\n\n\n\nb=\n\n\t\n\n-0.60413691\n\n\n\n\nR Square\n\n\t\n\n0.846639718\n\n\n\n\nStandard Error\n\n\t\n\n0.383187686\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\t\n\n17\n\nFigure 3: One-off entity level costs\n\na=\n\n\t\n\n-3.2145606\n\n\n\n\nb=\n\n\t\n\n-0.378026\n\n\n\n\nR Square\n\n\t\n\n0.678516\n\n\n\n\nStandard Error\n\n\t\n\n0.38652\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\t\n\n15\n\nFigure 4: Recurring product level costs\n\na=\n\n\t\n\n-2.4189734\n\n\n\n\nb=\n\n\t\n\n-0.4836461\n\n\n\n\nR Square\n\n\t\n\n0.61516\n\n\n\n\nStandard Error\n\n\t\n\n0.426611\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\t\n\n18\n\nFigure 5: One-off product level costs\n\na=\n\n\t\n\n-2.60399705\n\n\n\n\nb=\n\n\t\n\n-0.36264267\n\n\n\n\nR Square\n\n\t\n\n0.313470364\n\n\n\n\nStandard Error\n\n\t\n\n0.618120494\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\t\n\n17\n\nBased on the sample cost observations, a regression analysis has been performed to determine a cost function that estimates the relative costs (expressed as a percentage of AUM) as a dependent variable of AUM for entity level disclosures and of sustainable AUM (i.e. SFDR Art. 8 disclosing funds plus Art. 9 disclosing funds) for product related disclosures. The methodology varies for entity and product level disclosures as entity level disclosures apply to all financial market participants whereas product level disclosures apply only to financial market participants disclosing either under Art. 8 or Art. 9.\n\n3.7. Baseline scenario and application of the standard cost model 223\n\nThe standard cost model assumes that an entity has to fill out a form to provide a disclosure and that the effort needed to provide this disclosure is independent from the entity-size and other characteristics of the business. This means that the costs of disclosure are approximately identical for all entities.\n\nNumber of entities affected\n\n\t\n\nx\n\n\t\n\nFrequency of administrative action\n\n\t\n\nx\n\n\t\n\nTariff per hour\n\n\t\n\nx\n\n\t\n\nTime in hours\n\n\t\n\n+\n\n\t\n\nOut-of pocket expenses\n\nSource: Tool #58 EU Standard Cost Model of the Better Regulation Toolbox July 2023 224\n\nIf this assumption was applicable, it would be possible to pool the cost observations and to take e.g. the average cost and multiply it with the number of entities in the market and the frequency of disclosing information. However, as demonstrated in the previous section this is not the case for the SFDR disclosures and the costs vary by type of entity, in particular with the size of the entity.\n\nThe following methodological approach has therefore been taken to estimate the administrative burdens:\n\nEstimate of SFDR related disclosure costs as a function of the assets under management linked to the disclosure 225\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\nUsing the estimated cost function for each fund that was part of the EU market according to the Morningstar database, estimate SFDR related disclosure costs\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\nAggregation of the costs for all funds to obtain an estimate of the SFDR related costs for the EU market\n\n(1)\nEstimate of an SFDR related disclosure costs: we have collected a sample of costs (N=17) for product- and entity-related disclosures from the replies received in the stakeholder consultation. The replies covered all essential elements of disclosure preparation including internal costs for personnel and IT as well as external costs for data providers and consulting. From this sample, using a statistical regression model, a cost function has been estimated for the following cost types:\n\n\u00b7\nOne-off costs product level disclosures\n\n\u00b7\nRecurring costs product level disclosures\n\n\u00b7\nOne-off costs entity level disclosures\n\n\u00b7\nRecurring costs entity level disclosures\n\n(2)\nThe database Morningstar provides data for assets under management of funds that are obliged to disclose under the SFDR for the whole EU market and allows for a drill-down to the funds level, i.e. to aggregate the AuM per fund. The four cost functions for the four cost-types mentioned above (Figure 2 to Figure 5) have been used to estimate the one-off and recurring costs for entity and product-level disclosures as a function of AuM for each fund in the EU market.\n\nThe costs have been aggregated for the EU market by summing the individual estimates over all funds that were recorded by Morningstar.\n\nTable 2: Cost estimate one-off and recurring costs for product and entity level disclosures\n\nAUM\n\n\t\n\nSustainable AUM\n\n(Art. 8 & Art.9)\n\n\t\n\nRecurring cost\n\nentity level discl.\n\n\t\n\none-off cost\n\nentity level discl.\n\n\t\n\nRecuring cost\n\nproduct level discl.\n\n\t\n\none-off costs\n\nproduct level discl\n\n\n\n\nmillion EUR\n\n\t\n\nmillion EUR\n\n\t\n\nmillion EUR\n\n\t\n\nmillion EUR\n\n\t\n\nmillion EUR\n\n\t\n\nmillion EUR\n\n\n\n\n10 261 600\n\n\t\n\n6 110 400\n\n\t\n\n56\n\n\t\n\n120\n\n\t\n\n190\n\n\t\n\n380\n\nSource: Stakeholder consultation, Morningstar and own calculations\n\nThe table above summarizes the result for the costs estimated for the European market. We estimate that financial market participants have spent one-off implementation costs amounting to EUR\u00a0120 million for entity level disclosures and EUR 380 million for product level disclosures under the SFDR. Furthermore, we estimate annual recurring costs of EUR 56 million for entity-level and EUR 190 million for product-level disclosures. The recurring costs are assumed to constitute the costs of the baseline scenario.\n\n3.8. Role of the omnibus proposal for the baseline scenario\n\nSince 2021, the companies that have to disclose information under the SFDR have operated in an environment with data gaps, that have been filled by data providers and ESG rating agencies either with information that has been manually requested from the investee companies via questionnaires or if not available with estimates, e.g. with statistical estimates obtained from companies operating in a similar industry, of similar size, in a specific region, and other comparable characteristics. The data situation has improved over time. An analysis performed by the Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESMA, EBA and EIOPA) in 2024, reproduced in the table below, shows that key mandatory principle adverse indicators that are relevant for the SFDR are increasingly available with (green >80% median coverage; red <=20% low coverage; yellow 20-80% medium coverage) 226 .\n\nMandatory Principal Adverse Indicators (PAI) and their availability\n\n\n\n\nCoverage in %\n\nArt 8; Art 9\n\n\t\n\nClimate and other environment indicators\n\n\t\n\nCoverage %\n\nArt 8; Art 9\n\n\t\n\nSocial and governance\nindicators\n\n\n\n\n88; 94\n\n\t\n\nGHG Emissions (Scope 1,2,3 & Total)\n\n\t\n\n92; 96\n\n\t\n\nLack of processes and mechanisms to monitor compliance with UN Global Compact principles and OECD Guidelines\n\n\n\n\n89; 94\n\n\t\n\nCarbon Footprint\n\n\t\n\n88; 94\n\n\t\n\nViolations of UN Global Compact principles and OECD Guidelines\n\n\n\n\n91; 94\n\n\t\n\nGHG Intensity\n\n\t\n\n20; 16\n\n\t\n\nGender pay gap\n\n\n\n\n90; 95\n\n\t\n\nFossil fuel sector\n\n\t\n\n93; 96\n\n\t\n\nExposure to controversial weapons\n\n\n\n\n64; 65\n\n\t\n\nShare of non-renewable energy consumption\n\n\t\n\n87; 93\n\n\t\n\nBoard gender diversity\n\n\n\n\n27; 45\n\n\t\n\nShare of non-renewable energy production\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n88; 95\n\n\t\n\nActivities negatively affecting biodiversity\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n4; 7\n\n\t\n\nEmissions to water (tons)\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n42; 45\n\n\t\n\nHazardous waste ratio/ radioactive waste ratio\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\nSource: Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities, JC-2024-69: Principal Adverse Impact disclosures under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation\n\nThe CSRD (original and post-omnibus timetables below) in its original (pre-omnibus scope) would have improved the data availability with coverage of European investees covering both listed and unlisted large companies as well as certain SMEs (parents of large groups).\n\nThe timeline below shows that public interest entities (PIEs), i.e. those companies that are the investees, that to a major extent constitute the portfolio population of the funds that are subject to the SFDR would have started to report in Q1 2025, which was not postponed by the Omnibus proposal 227 .\n\n\t\n\nWave 1 - 2024\n\n(reporting 2025)\n\n\t\n\nWave 2 - 2025\n\n(reporting 2026)\n\n\t\n\nWave 3 - 2026-2028\n\n(reporting 2027-29)\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nPublic interest entities (>500 employees) 228\n\n\t\n\nLarge undertakings\n\n\t\n\nSME undertakings\n\n\n\n\nNew timeline\n\n\t\n\nNo stop the clock rule; same timeline\n\n\t\n\nPostpone by 2 years\n\n\n\n\nNew scope\n\n\t\n\nRemove large midcaps (with <1000 employees)\n\n\t\n\nRemove Large midcaps (with <1000 employees)\n\n\t\n\nRemove\n\n\n\n\nSFDR relevance\n\n\t\n\nHigh, investees of UCITS, Bond and Money Market funds\n\n\t\n\nLow, typically bank financed, relevant as investees of certain alternative investment funds, e.g. private equity\n\nSource: European Commission, SWD (2025) 80, Omnibus proposal.\n\nThe SFDR data requirements concern mainly listed companies as it regulates disclosures of enterprises offering investment products consisting largely of listed investees with the exception of alternative investment funds and venture capital funds that hold also private non-listed assets. According to ECB data Euro-area Non-Financial Corporations had outstanding listed debt of EUR 1.6 trillion 229 and listed shares of EUR 7.6 trillion 230 by the end of 2023, of which investment funds held 34% and 24% respectively 231 , a total of EUR 2,4 trillion of listed securities. Expressed as a share of EU assets under management of about EUR 16 trillion, this represents about 15%. These investees are subject to CSRD reporting.\n\nCSRD wave 1 companies, i.e. companies that were subject to the NFRD and started reporting under the CSRD/ESRS for fiscal year 2024 (i.e., publication in 2025) are thus key investees for SFDR reporting. These companies will not be affected retroactively by the planned scope reductions (\"stop-the-clock\" or omnibus proposals) as these reductions primarily impact companies covered in later CSRD waves. Rather, a replacement can be expected of currently either estimated values or data collected with questionnaires by data from audited sustainability reporting for about 15% of the investee universe. This data collection step would usually be performed by data providers, which do continue providing ESG data to financial market participants with or without the omnibus and we do not expect that this improvement of quality for certain datapoints would have significant impact on the data provider fees charged to financial market participants.\n\n3.9. Who is bearing the cost of the SFDR implementation?\n\nWhile in absolute terms the amounts reported for one-off and recurring costs in our sample for the SFDR implementation seem high (ranging up to EUR 29 million of one-off investment and up to EUR 10 million of annual recurring costs for one FMP), in relative terms, the costs, e.g. for large FMP (with AuM > EUR 25 billion) that dominate the market in terms of product volume (about 75% in the Morningstar funds population), are in a range of 0.002-0.15 basis points (one basis point is only 1/100 one hundredth of one percentage point) for annual recurring costs and 0.01 to 0.46 basis points for one-off costs, that are usually written off over several years by businesses. This indicates that even if the fees were 100% passed on to end-investors, they should not face substantial changes in the transaction fees. This is in line with observations of ESMA that has shown, e.g. that the fees of UCITS funds have not significantly changed in the period 2021-2023. 232 Furthermore ESMA has shown in the same publication that there are no significant differences in the fees charged for ESG UCITS and general UCITS funds.\n\nTo gauge further the economic significance of these costs as compared to the benefits, if these amounts were instead used to directly reduce CO2-emmissions, taking into account that EEA reports that the EU-27 countries emitted around 2\u00a0907\u00a0204 kilo tonnes of CO2 in 2020 233 and a price of about 96.3 EUR per tonne of CO2 234 , they would achieve annual savings of 0.1% Co2 emissions. In other words, it suffices that SFDR achieves an annual reduction of 0.1% in Co2 emissions in order for the associated costs to be justified.\n\n3.10.

Results give only indications of potential costs and are to be interpreted with caution as they are based on extremely small samples, in particular for SMEs where the simplification should bring most benefits; the one-off costs might be overestimated as the one/two respondents on which the estimation is based assume a certain minimum fixed amount that needs to be spent to implement the changes that is even higher than the initial one-off costs.\n\nThe cost calculations presented above are only rough indications as most respondents were not able to estimate costs as at the preparatory stage of level 1, including without the technical details to be specified in level 2. Therefore, only anecdotal evidence could be collected that can give a rough indication of the cost impacts of this regulation. The results suggest that SMEs (which would choose to be active in offering ESG products) might expect significant one-off costs that can be offset in the long-term by corresponding cost savings, whereas large businesses have only limited one-off costs and are likely to set these investments off quickly (after about 2 years). As part of the level 2 work, European Supervisory Authorities should verify the plausibility of these estimations once detailed proposals have been worked out, and if respondents indicate that they expect significantly different costs, the cost implications should be taken into account when deciding on the preferred option to make sure that the objective of administrative simplification and burden reduction is met.\n\n3.11 Summary costs, benefits and one-in-one-out calculation\n\nOverview of costs and benefits identified in the evaluation\n\n\n\n\nMeasure\n\n\t\n\nCost Benefit Type*\n\n\t\n\nGroup Affected**\n\n\t\n\nFrequency\n\n\t\n\nAmount\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nRequirement to publish entity level disclosures\n\n\t\n\nDirect benefit\n\n\t\n\nCitizens that are retail investors and Businesses acting as professional investors\n\n\t\n\nRecurrent\n\n\t\n\nqualitative\n\n\t\n\nEntity-level disclosures of FMPs provide information on their policies on integrating sustainability risks, how they consider principal adverse impacts on sustainability factors, and how their remuneration policies align with sustainability objectives.

The options are set to help EU FMPs improve their cost competitiveness by addressing many of the identified undue burdens and excessive compliance costs associated with the status quo. The preferred option to alleviate burdens and costs of reporting will remove duplications and inconsistencies, facilitating market entry. The preferred option to set up a clear and coherent categorisation system for sustainability-linked financial products reflects current market practices to a large extent, entailing minimal adjustment costs compared to the alternatives. These costs are expected to be outweighed by the economic benefits of continued investment flows according to a simpler, clearer and more intuitive categorisation of products.\n\nGiven the EU\u2019s overwhelming market share for sustainable financial products globally, a positive impact is also to be expected on international competitiveness. The competitive position of EU FMPs and funds in launching and providing services in relation to sustainability-linked financial products would be further bolstered. Through lower costs arising from the removal of undue burdens and a simpler categorisation regime for products, the EU market for sustainable products can also be expected to grow, to help scale up the flow of private savings and investments into the real economy and its transition towards more sustainable economic practices. Given the dominant size of the EU market in this area, the categorisation regime can be expected to become a de facto global standard and contribute to attracting inward investment flows into the EU.\n\nThe market\u2019s capacity to innovate is also positively supported by reduced reporting burdens and clear product categories. Lower compliance costs can help free up FMPs\u2019 resources for product innovation. The criteria underpinning the categories leave room for flexibility allowing FMPs to design products according to diverse parameters, while providing the essential reassurance to retail investors about what their products can and cannot invest in. The criteria would be future-proof and allow to continue designing and innovating products according to emerging technological trends and evolutions in science and environmental policy. Overall, provided FMPs seize opportunities to design products in accordance with a simple categorisation system, increased funds toward private sustainability-oriented innovations in the real economy can be expected to ensue, supporting the flow of additional private risk capital toward the twin green and digital transitions to finance the EU\u2019s long-term climate and competitiveness goals.\n\nIn terms of sectors which are most likely to be impacted, some negative effects could arise for those targeted by the PAB/CTB exclusions, namely tobacco, controversial weapons, and companies involved in human rights violations or heavily in fossil fuels. However, this would continue their treatment under PAB/CTB benchmarks, and would not apply beyond ESG-focused financial products. Non-ESG focused products could still fully include these companies at FMPs\u2019 and investors\u2019 discretion. Conversely, the creation of categories could support positive impacts notably in sectors associated with high levels of environmental and social progress (sustainable category), those undertaking meaningful improvement toward less harmful environmental or social practices (transition category), and those which can be accommodated in various other diverse ESG strategies (other ESG category). For instance, the sustainable category could further help boost investment in EU companies with Taxonomy-aligned activities, in key Taxonomy-eligible sectors such as renewable energies, transport, manufacturing and real estate 245 . For its part, the transition category could help facilitate investment toward a wide range of sectors for which meaningful transition-trajectories are most advanced or under development. For example, a key metric in this context would be the market-led Science-Based Targets initiative, which has gathered commitments from over 10000 companies across the world (53% from Europe), with the highest number in the services and manufacturing sectors 246 . Finally, the third category could encompass a variety of sectors pursuing diverse ESG strategies, and appeal notably to investors interested in a diversified product with clear ESG-based exclusions 247 .\n\nFinally, the initiative is also expected to have a positive impact on SME competitiveness. Together with the provisions of the Omnibus (i.e. removal of listed SMEs from the scope, value chain cap applicable to companies outside the CSRD to limit trickle-down effects, single voluntary standard for companies outside the CSRD), SMEs can benefit from the flow of funds and be included in products under a simple categorisation\u00a0system, as well as from lower reporting and compliance costs incumbent on FMPs. While SMEs may typically not constitute a large share of the portfolios of investees within mainstream (UCITS) financial products, the simplification of disclosures and clear criteria underpinning categories could support some reallocation of portfolios toward greater inclusion of SMEs, including through greater clarity on the use of estimates and proxies. This could stem from addressing any bias in favour of larger listed companies from whom granular data is more available.\n\n\nAnnex 6: Interactions between the SFDR and the sustainable finance and broader corporate sustainability framework\n\nThis annex aims at explaining the interactions between the SFDR and the rest of the sustainable finance and broader corporate sustainability framework. It also highlights the specific considerations that need to be taken into account for the review regarding the links and necessary alignments between the SFDR and the CSRD, the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the Benchmark Regulation, CSDDD and the MiFID/IDD sustainability delegated act.\n\n1.\nThe EU sustainability disclosure regimes and tools that feed into the SFDR\n\nBox 5: The flow of information: from companies to the financial sector to end investors\n\nCorporate Reporting Disclosure Directive (CSRD)\n\nWhat is the CSRD\n\nThe Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) modernised and strengthened the rules concerning the disclosure of sustainability information by undertakings in response to the increased demand for corporate sustainability information and transparency. The existing CSRD requires that large undertakings and listed SMEs disclose information necessary to understand the undertaking\u2019s impacts on sustainability (ESG) matters, and information necessary to understand how sustainability matters affect the undertaking\u2019s development, performance and position. The CSRD phases in the reporting requirements for different categories of undertakings.\n\nThe reporting requirements are specified in European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), which were developed in draft form by EFRAG and adopted by the Commission via Delegated Regulation 2023/2772.\n\nHow does it interact with the SFDR\n\nFMPs rely on ESG information disclosed by investee companies under the CSRD (the \u2018European Sustainability Reporting Standards\u2019, or ESRS) to assess the principal adverse impacts (PAIs) of their investments. To this end, the ESRS mirrors the PAIs to ensure FMPs get the information needed.\n\nHowever, the CSRD does not cover all entities/assets that FMPs invest in. For example, the CSRD does not apply to most third-country companies. In the EU, the CSRD currently applies to all large companies and all listed companies (including listed SMEs and non-EU companies listed in EU). It also applies to non-EU companies that generate more than EUR 150 million in the EU and have either an EU branch with turnover above 40 million or an EU subsidiary that is itself in CSRD scope. This scope represents on average 30% of EU portfolios. To bridge the data gaps, FMPs are using estimates.\n\nIn addition, the recent omnibus Commission proposal reduces the CSRD scope. Reporting obligations would apply only to large companies with more than 1000 employees (i.e. companies with more than 1000 employees and either turnover above EUR 50 million or balance sheet above EUR 25 million). Non-EU companies in scope would be reduced to the ones generating a turnover above EUR 450 million, with an EU branch threshold set at EUR 50 million and EU subsidiary threshold set at \u201clarge\u2019. The ESRS are also expected to be streamlined.\n\nSpecial considerations for the review: the disclosures and criteria need to take account of the upcoming loss of publicly available data from CSRD companies. The need to generate/buy estimates is expected to grow.\n\nEU Taxonomy Regulation\n\nWhat is the EU taxonomy\n\nThe EU Taxonomy provides a classification system of environmentally sustainable economic activities. It helps address the risk of greenwashing and supports investors in directing their capital towards the activities needed for the green transition. The EU Taxonomy can also serve as a tool for financial and non-financial undertakings to plan and communicate on their business strategies, transition planning, as well as their investing and lending activities for the transition to a low-carbon, sustainable economy.\n\nHow does it interact with the SFDR\n\nFinancial products promoting environmental characteristics or having an environmental objective are required to regularly disclose their alignment with the EU Taxonomy.\n\nThe recent Commission proposals pursuant to the Omnibus simplify the reporting templates, leading to a reduction of data points by 64-89% depending on the type of company, introduces a materiality threshold to make disclosure of alignment for companies with less 10% eligible activities not mandatory, introduces the option of reporting partial alignment to foster transition finance, reduces the scope for mandatory reporting on operational expenditure and simplifies certain criteria 248 .\n\nSpecial considerations for the review: same as for the CSRD\n\nBenchmark Regulation\n\nWhat ESG disclosures does the Benchmark Regulation provide\n\nThe Benchmark Regulation (BMR) introduced disclosure requirements for all EU benchmarks with ESG factors, mandating administrators to disclose whether they integrate ESG in their benchmark design, and if so how. BMR also requires benchmark administrators of EU Climate Benchmarks, i.e. Paris-Aligned Benchmark (PAB) and Climate Transition Benchmark (CTB) to regularly report on the performance of their benchmarks against a set of sustainability-related Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Their methodologies rely on minimum technical requirements focused on decarbonisation trajectory and activity exclusions. Exclusions encompass companies that significantly harm one or more environmental objectives set out in the Taxonomy Regulation. PABs and CTBs are designed to reorient investment towards ESG opportunities rather than focusing on simple risk reduction, in line with the objectives of a transition to a climate-resilient economy.\n\nHow does it interact with the SFDR\n\nESG disclosures from benchmark administrators are indispensable for FMPs relying on benchmarks for their ESG features of their portfolio. In addition, SFDR Art.9(3) recognises EU climate benchmarks as a robust investment strategy for funds having as their objective a reduction in carbon emissions. They are widely used as reliable labels for investment products pursuing a sustainable investment objective.\n\nSpecial considerations for the review: the future SFDR criteria must ensure alignment with the criteria of the EU Climate Benchmarks to ensure these can be recognised as a robust way to comply with the categories. Products following such benchmarks should automatically be recognised under the relevant category. In addition, the future SFDR disclosures should take the benchmark disclosures into account to avoid situations in which FMPs cannot get necessary data on the indices they use (to the extent possible.\n\nEuropean Green Bonds standard\n\nEUGBS is a voluntary standard to help scale up and raise the environmental ambitions of the green bond market. It sets a gold standard for how companies and public authorities can use green bonds to raise funds on capital markets to finance ambitious large-scale green investments, while meeting high sustainability requirements and protecting investors. The use of proceeds must be 100% aligned with the EU Taxonomy Regulation, with the exception of the so-called flexibility pocket up to 15%, ensuring that financed projects contribute substantially to at least one of the six environmental objectives, do no significant harm to others, and meet minimum social safeguards. Both EU-based and international private or public issuers can adopt the standard, making it a potential global benchmark.\n\nHow can this tool be used under the SFDR\n\nIt can help investors to easily assess, compare and verify that their investments are sustainable and ensure that funds are allocated to taxonomy-aligned economic activities, thereby reducing greenwashing risks.\n\n2.\nSFDR information feeds into the sustainability preferences and target market under MiFID and IDD delegated acts\n\nThese rules introduced the notion retail investors\u2019 sustainability preferences as part of the suitability test in investment and insurance advice. Investors are given the opportunity to set minimum sustainability requirements for their investments which can be expressed in relation to SFDR disclosures (proportion of taxonomy-aligned investment, proportion of sustainable investment, consideration of principal adverse impact). Distributors therefore rely on products\u2019 information made available under the SFDR to match retail investors\u2019 preferences.\n\nConsideration for the review: The future SFDR categories should be designed in a way that is easily understandable for retail investors to ease the implementation of the suitability test. In addition, the scope of financial products that can be distributed under MiFID and IDD is broader than the SFDR scope (e.g. shares, bonds, derivatives, structured notes\u2026). The review should explore whether some of these products (especially structured notes) should be scoped in the SFDR to avoid greenwashing and ease as much as possible the implementation of the rules by distributors.\n\n3.\nFurther considerations regarding other specific parts of the EU acquis\n\nCorporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD)\n\nThe CSDDD requires very large companies and ultimate parent companies of groups domiciled or active in the EU to conduct due diligence to identify and address adverse human rights and environmental impacts in their own operations, their subsidiaries and their value chains. It also requires them to adopt a transition plan for climate change mitigation.\n\nHow does it interact with the SFDR\n\nCompliance with the CSDDD entails that companies under the scope will be either sustainable or on a credible path to sustainability with respect to human rights impacts and those environmental impacts that are regulated by the international conventions listed in the Annex of the Directive, and will have adopted relevant good governance and management practices. These due diligence efforts and compliance with the CSDDD can influence investment decisions under the SFDR. In turn, the SFDR has the potential to help companies under the CSDDD finance their sustainability transition.\n\nShareholder rights Directive, Green Claims Directive, EU Ecolabel, Unfair Commercial Practices Directive\n\n4.\nThe Shareholder Rights Directive (SRD), as amended in 2017, sets out \u201ccomply or explain\u201d rules for institutional investors and asset managers with respect to their engagement and investment policies. Its Chapter Ib entered into application in June 2019 and requires institutional investors and asset managers to be more transparent about their investment strategies, their engagement policies and the implementation thereof. These \u201centity-level\u201d rules help investors and ultimate beneficiaries such as future pensioners, life insurance policy holders and investment fund unit holders to optimise their investment decisions, also taking into account their preferences, including with respect to the long-term non-financial performance of the investee companies. As regards the (proposed) Green Claims Directive, SFDR disclosures are distinct as the directive does not apply to mandatory or voluntary sustainability information required under EU financial services rules including in the areas governed by the SFDR. The SFDR is also distinct from the mooted project to create an EU ecolabel for financial products, which could have led to a system of granting an EU-level sustainability label to certain funds based on defined conditions, but which is currently on hold 249 . Finally, the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 250 and its subsequent Commission guidance on unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices 251 \u00a0provides examples of what constitute misleading environmental claims or green claims, which apply horizontally to all commercial products and are meant to complement existing rules that take into account the specific features of financial products. Claims under the revised SFDR could fall within the definition of \u2018environmental claims\u2019 under Article 2(1)(o) of the Directive, the requirements of which would be met by application of the requirements under the SFDR (consistent with Article 3(4) and (9) of that Directive). ESMA guidelines on fund names\n\nIn May 2024, ESMA issued its final guidelines 252 for funds marketed in the EU that use ESG- or sustainability-related terms in their names. The guidelines, which aim at protecting investors against greenwashing risk, set minimum requirements. Fund managers had until May 21, 2025, to either align with the requirements or change fund names to ensure compliance.\u00a0Consistent with the personal scope of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, the guidelines are directed at fund managers 253 marketing funds in the EU.\n\nFund category\n\n\t\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\nNo ESG word in name\n\n\t\n\nNo additional requirement\n\n\n\n\nSocial/governance or transition related term or \u201ctransition\u201d in name\n\n\t\n\n-\nMinimum of 80% of investments used to meet environmental or social characteristics/sustainable investment objectives.\n\n-\nCTB exclusions 254 : exclusions of companies involved in (1) any activities related to controversial weapons; (2) the cultivation and production of tobacco; (3) in violations of the UN Global Compact (UN GC) principles or the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\n-\nIf \u2018transition\u2019: investments contained in the 80% thresholds must be on a clear and measurable path to social or environmental transition\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment-related or impact related terms in name\n\n\t\n\n-\nMinimum of 80% of investments used to meet environmental or social characteristics/sustainable investment objectives.\n\n-\nPAB exclusions: CTB exclusions + exclusions of companies that derive\u00a0: (4) 1 % or more of their revenues from exploration, mining, extraction, distribution or refining of hard coal and lignite; (5) 10 % or more of their revenues from the exploration, extraction, distribution or refining of oil fuels; (6) 50 % or more of their revenues from the exploration, extraction, manufacturing or distribution of gaseous fuels; (7) 50 % or more of their revenues from electricity generation with a GHG intensity of more than 100 g CO2 e/kWh.\n\n-\nIf \u2018impact\u2019: investments contained in the 80% thresholds must be made with the objective to generate a positive and measurable social or environmental impact alongside a financial return.\n\n\n\n\nSustainable related terms in name\n\n\t\n\n-\nMinimum of 80% of investments used to meet environmental or social characteristics/sustainable investment objectives.\n\n-\nPAB exclusions: CTB exclusions + exclusions of companies that derive\u00a0: (4) 1 % or more of their revenues from exploration, mining, extraction, distribution or refining of hard coal and lignite; (5) 10 % or more of their revenues from the exploration, extraction, distribution or refining of oil fuels; (6) 50 % or more of their revenues from the exploration, extraction, manufacturing or distribution of gaseous fuels; (7) 50 % or more of their revenues from electricity generation with a GHG intensity of more than 100 g CO2 e/kWh\n\n-\nInvest meaningfully in sustainable investment (minimum of 50%)\n\n5.\nHow the Omnibus interacts with the SFDR review\n\nThe SFDR was not included as part of the announcement by the Commission President in November 2024 setting the stage for the February 2025 Omnibus 255 . This focused rather on simplifications to sustainability information under CSRD, the EU Taxonomy and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. The review of the SFDR was already well underway by this time, with the consultations carried out already having clearly signalled the preferred directions how to simplify the framework. In other words, the priority objective of simplification underpinning the Omnibus was already well-established for the review of the SFDR at that time, and signalled accordingly under a \"simplification\u201d policy objective in the Commission 2025 Work Programme 256 .\n\nIt is also appropriate to carry out the review of the SFDR in a successive step and to reflect, in its revised design, the new scope and range of sustainability information from corporates to be delivered under the Omnibus. This helps avoid a situation like in 2021 where FMPs\u2019 disclosure obligations were defined before those of EU corporates/investees were clear 257 . At the same time, it is not advisable to delay adopting the reviewed SFDR until all changes under the Omnibus are complete, including the finalisation of simplification changes to the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). This is to avoid prolonging FMPs having disclosure obligations under SFDR which are no longer catered for (with specific datapoints 258 ) under a revised ESRS, which could also complicate the effort to simplify ESRS the longer this persists.\n\nReviewing the SFDR is also necessary and coherent subsequent to the Omnibus, given its focus on paring back excessive requirements notably in the CSRD and the EU Taxonomy. In this regard however, while publicly available corporate sustainability information from larger EU corporates/investees under these frameworks will continue to be important under SFDR, the investable universe for financial products always extended far beyond listed and larger EU companies under the CSRD scope. Besides the strong support from investors for information on the sustainability features of financial products, reviewing the SFDR in a commensurate way is nonetheless necessary to sustain the specific use-case for sustainability information required under the CSRD and Taxonomy to inform the composition and disclosures for financial products. Otherwise, the continued purpose of the CSRD and Taxonomy would be partially undermined.\n\nAnnex 7: Additional background on specific sectors or investments\n\nSpecial considerations for insurance and pension products\n\nManufacturers of pension schemes and funds and insurance-based products have faced challenges in the first years of the SFDR implementation. They have flagged that they manage complex portfolios, with a broader range of listed and unlisted assets, than most retail investment products, and that some of their main assets cannot be assessed against the ESG framework, in particular for sovereign bonds. These points are not specific to pension and insurance products, however, as many UCITS and AIFs face the same challenges. However, this coupled with regulatory constraints and data availability issues, has led to lower portfolio ratios for pensions and insurance providers that can be aligned with the concepts for sustainable investments given in the SFDR (i.e. Taxonomy-alignment or definition of sustainable investment).\n\nThe pension funds industry has shown a nuanced support for a categorisation system and raised two issues linked to the specificities of the sector:\n\n(1)\nConcerns that the criteria would not fit their portfolio: FMPs have flagged that the current SFDR disclosures (i.e. PAIs, good governance and taxonomy KPIs) are applicable mainly to listed equity but not the other assets in which pension funds/IORPs invest. These data points are either very difficult (PAIs) or impossible to generate (Taxonomy) for assets such as sovereign bonds.\n\nAccording to feedback received, the two sets of criteria outlined in Section 5 could make sense, but they would need to reflect the nature of the assets held by such products. The pension funds industry for instance points out that various long-term products (characterised by diversification, low risk) might never reach the \u201csustainable\u201d category.\u00a0FMPs have also flagged that portfolio level PAB exclusions would not be applicable to 100% of pension funds/IORPs due to their investments in certain assets.\n\n(2)\nConcerns that the potential role for the categories in the distribution and marketing rules would not fit their sectoral rules. Some pension funds participants have a fundamentally different customer journey than retail investors. Members of IORPs and certain pension products are automatically enrolled, while some pension products are commercialised and compete with other financial products. Moreover, for auto-enrolment products, FMPs argued that products would not have any incentive to mislead consumers through greenwashing, questioning the need to reinforce their marketing rules.\n\nThe insurance industry has similar concerns. The majority of FMPs consider that criteria should be suitable for broadly diversified portfolios, e.g. in respect of the prudent person principle in Solvency II, and the diversified range of products they cover. Stakeholders have also asked that categories should guarantee that all investment instruments (e.g. government bonds) of portfolios are covered by the metrics of the system.\n\nFMPs have also argued that criteria will also need to reflect the characteristics of insurance products. Stakeholders have identified some technical elements that should be addressed (e.g. the definition of \u2018all investments\u2019\u00a0encompasses many assets that have nothing to do with investments, like deposit to cedants or cash equivalents).\n\nTreatment of sovereign 259 bonds Given the specific nature of general purpose sovereign bonds which can fund a variety of public sector expenditures such as hospitals, schools etc. or investments such as transport networks and other infrastructures, and which can thus be difficult to assess against sustainability metrics, specific solutions are required on how to integrate them in any calculations for the positive contribution criterion linked to product categories 260 . The solution should apply beyond insurance and pension products.\n\nAn option is to continue including them and signal relevant metrics against which they can be assessed (provided e.g. by the World Bank 261 , some NGOs or other entities/trade bodies 262 ), but these may not cover the same ground as would be possible for corporate bonds, across all relevant ESG metrics. Another would be to include them only for the parts of products which are screened using similar metrics, e.g. associated with social and governance metrics such as human rights and corruption. This would mean FMPs having to provide more detailed explanations distinguishing between parts of products where comparable data between sovereign and corporate issuers is possible and where it is not.\n\nAlternatively, they could be included based solely on a screening of available metrics (and spared from having to be assessed against unavailable ones). This could mean quasi-automatic qualification for some issuers which fare well in relation to human rights and other governance indicators or climate change and other environmental commitments, and outright exclusion of those that don\u2019t (e.g. favouring EU sovereign issuers as opposed to those blacklisted under various instruments e.g. sanctions, money laundering or tax avoidance lists etc).\n\nYet another option could be for FMPs to have the option of excluding them and providing explanations in their disclosures of the part of products that this relates to. However, this could have drawbacks in terms of overall comparability. Finally, sovereign bonds could be excluded altogether, subject to a review clause on their inclusion, subsequent to the development of guidance or further methodologies for how to assess them more comprehensively against sustainability metrics.\n\nStakeholder feedback on the issue is also mixed and inconclusive. There is seemingly little support for either outright inclusion or exclusion. The intermediate options of partial/optional inclusion may thus be preferred, subject to additional disclosures. Given the primarily political nature of the decision, however, these options are not subject to further consideration of their relative impacts in this impact assessment.\n\nMulti-option products (\u201cMOPs\u201d) which allow consumers to choose between different underlying funds for investing, should be able to demonstrate that they fulfil the criteria of the categories and be classified accordingly. This is a challenge due to, inter alia, investment options that are not financial products sold as part of IBIPs (and pension schemes) in many Member States, or the variety of underlying investments, which often can be determined by the client at the point of sale.\n\nSpecial considerations for impact investing\n\nImpact investing refers to the small but growing market practice of managing and channelling investments that target measurable change in specific environmental or social areas. The practice involves investment funds set up with a pre-defined intention with regard to addressing an environmental or social need, investing in specialised companies or projects delivering targeted solutions in these areas, and measuring and managing the desired impact while earning a financial return for investors. The funds typically define an upfront strategy (\u2018theory of change\u2019) to underpin investments and seek to ensure, and measure, impacts in terms of outcomes which would not have happened without the investments. The funds can invest, for instance, in start-ups pursuing environmental solutions or products and other initiatives and ventures targeting specified social or health outcomes.\n\nAccording to Impact Europe, a trade association representing the industry, in 2024 the European impact investing market managed EUR190 billion in assets under management, up from around EUR 80 billion in 2022. Data from ESMA and Morningstar shows a fourfold increase in the use of the term \u201cimpact\u201d in funds\u2019 names between 2019 and mid-2024, with roughly 450 European UCITS and AIFs using the term (compared to over 7500 using general ESG terms), representing 0.57% of total UCITS and 0.51% total AIFs. Growth seems to have levelled off since 2023. The broad concept is recognised as one of the four distinct labels under the UK FCA\u2019s Sustainability Disclosure Requirements, and the use of the term is also subject to ESMA\u2019s guidelines on fund names using ESG terms. ESMA is also developing a supervisory tool to promote convergence in oversight by NCAs of the practice.\n\nSome stakeholders, notably from the impact industry itself, have favoured creating a dedicated category for impact investing in the SFDR, saying this would give added clarity and visibility to the practice, and help mobilise funds in pursuit of various (possibly underserved) EU objectives. Some stakeholders also suggest that a dedicated category would be needed to serve the 50% of European investors who are found to want to make a real-world impact with their savings, and channel funds towards start ups and scale ups working on innovative green and social solutions 263 ..However, given the relatively small scale and recent character of the activity in the overall context of ESG investing, the nascent and developing supervisory experiences, as well as balance of stakeholder views, the case for a distinct category in a revised SFDR does not appear crucial. Rather, it is assessed that the activity can be accommodated in the broader more encompassing categorisation, e.g. within the principles and criteria for sustainable or transition products. Specific disclosures can apply to funds claiming impact in their names or in their disclosures, based on a common definition of the practice (e.g. theory of change, monitoring of the impact etc).\n\nSpecial considerations regarding the defence sector\n\nAmid some concerns raised in the past that \u2018ESG factors\u2019 are posing impediments to investments in the defence sector, the Commission has clarified on several occasions that there are no such restrictions in the SFDR, or in the\u00a0EU sustainable finance framework more broadly. For example, the March 2024 Communication for a European Defence Industrial Strategy (EDIS) 264 sets out that \u201cunder the EU sustainable finance framework, no EU rule, or any EU planned rule, impedes private investment in the defence industry\u201d\u00a0 265 . This messaging was reaffirmed by the White Paper on European Defence Readiness 2030 of March 2025 266 , stating that the SFDR review will provide additional clarifications \u201con the relationship of defence with the investment goals of the sustainability framework\u201d.\n\nUnder the SFDR companies active in the defence sector are subject to the same expectations as companies in any other sectors. However, in practice some product providers or supervisors may de-facto consider such investments as incompatible with products making ESG claims, reflecting in part potential long-standing concerns of some investors to invest in the defence sector.\n\nAgainst this, the review of the SFDR should reflect relevant unfolding developments regarding the need to continue supporting private investments towards defence 267 . The SFDR\u00a0should notably build on the guidance from the Commission regarding the application of the EU sustainable finance framework regarding the defence sector. This guidance, announced in the EDIS Communication, re-confirms that nothing in the framework discriminates against defence 268 and that investing in companies in the defence sector can be compatible with a sustainable investment strategy provided that the relevant due diligence checks are performed like for other sectors. The revised SFDR should also duly reflect the actions,\u00a0announced in the March 2025 White Paper, to further bolster access to finance for the defence sector in the defence readiness omnibus proposals\u00a0of June 2025 269 .\n\nThe policy choices for the SFDR review in this area flow from these steps taken by the Commission and are not subject to further consideration in this impact assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnex 8: Additional information and illustrative examples of potential criteria and disclosures (option 3.1 and 3.2) and approach to estimation\n\nThis annex recaps and further explains the suggested criteria presented in section 5.4 under option 3.1 and 3.2. It also provides for mock templates for the streamlined disclosures described under option 2.2.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The content of this annex does not pre-empt the future elaboration of level 2 rules. It aims at providing more information on the type of criteria which could be elaborated on the basis of high-level principles to be set in the regulation. It also aims at helping readers understand how the categories can work in practice and what the suggested disclosures could look like.\n\nANNEX 8 - TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n1.\nSection 1: Proposed criteria for the categories proposed in option 3.1 and 3.2.\n\n1.1.\nThe two pillars approach\n\n1.2.\nConcrete criteria per category\n\n1.3.\nIllustrative example of how the criteria could be implemented\n\n1.4.\nEvidence of the usability and feasibility of the criteria\n\n2.\nSection 2: Proposed product disclosures under option 2.2.\n\n3.\nSection 3: Proposed approach to estimation to bridge the ESG data gaps\n\nSECTION 1: UNDERLYING CRITERIA FOR THE CATEGORIES PROPOSED UNDER OPTION 3.1 AND 3.2\n\nThis section describes the set of criteria suggested for the categories and provides for illustrative examples of what the concrete and detailed criteria (to be further developed at level 2) could look like. It also provides illustrative examples of how these criteria could be applied in practice and provides evidence of the feasibility of the suggested criteria as well as evidence of their likely impact.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE MAIN FINDINGS:\n\nThe current SFDR definition of \u2018sustainable investment\u2019 builds on three principles: investment having an environmental or social objective, causing no significant harm (as per the \u2018do no significant harm\u2019 [DNSH] principle through the consideration of the principal adverse impact indicators) and investing in companies with good governance practices.\n\nAs set out in Sections 5.4 and 6.3 in the main report, the revised criteria build on these core principles and underpin them with a set of clear minimum criteria to prevent greenwashing and the excessive fragmentation of FMPs\u2019 approaches. This would bring clarity to FMPs in the application of the criteria, help systematize the categorisation process and enhance the comparability of products. The cost of implementation of these criteria will be limited by ensuring continuity with robust market practices and existing rules, namely the ESMA guidelines on funds\u2019 names.\n\nHow will the proposed criteria enhance comparability and help fight greenwashing?\n\nThe evaluation (annex 11) has identified that the lack of clarity linked to the concept of \u2018sustainable investment\u2019 has led to widely different interpretations and implementation approaches amongst FMPs. As shown in box 10 of annex 1, the exposure to sustainable investments of products tracking a similar benchmark can range from 1% to 80%.\n\nThe evaluation also finds that the \u2018DNSH test\u2019, which is done through the high-level principle of \u2018consideration of principal adverse impacts\u2019, has not led to harmonised implementation practices and has not prevented harmful investments. This is mainly because the current SFDR leaves considerable discretion to FMPs in choosing how they consider these impacts.\n\nTo remedy this, two main measures are suggested to enhance the comparability and help fight greenwashing:\n\n\u00d8\nPositive contribution: Setting a minimum portion of investment to contribute to the sustainability objective (70/80% of the product)\n\n\u00d8\nExclusions: Setting clear exclusions of harmful industries and activities in which products cannot invest in \u2013 these exclusions would be aligned with the ones of the EU Climate Benchmarks, as introduced by the ESMA guidelines on funds\u2019 names\n\nWhat is the evidence that reliable and comparable sustainable information is available for the proposed criteria? How to ensure that the costs of implementation and market disruptions will be limited (to the extent possible)?\n\nSection 1.4 presents further evidence on the feasibility of the proposed criteria based on market analysis of current financial products.\n\nFirst, the bulk of the suggested criteria replicate what has already\u00a0been introduced under the ESMA guidelines for ESG funds names . The guidelines,\u00a0which started applying in May 2025, require investment funds with ESG-related terms in their names to (1) ensure that at least 80% of the investments align with their ESG objectives/characteristics; (2) apply the exclusions of the EU Climate Benchmarks. The number of investment funds currently applying these requirements has been estimated at 4.570 270 . The same study also estimates that the universe of funds using ESG-related terms only decreased by 8% since the entry into application of these requirements, showing that most funds in scope managed to implement the ESMA criteria. Since the criteria for the categories largely build on these guidelines, most of the one-off implementation costs would have already been borne by funds in scope of the guidelines. In addition, market analysis described in section 1.4 shows that the implementation of sectoral exclusions are the key elements of comparability identified in funds with ESG characteristics or objectives, demonstrating the well-established market practices around exclusions 271 .\n\nSecond, the criteria refer to sustainability topics for which the information is either available from investee companies or possible to estimate by FMPs/external providers when the information is missing (more information on the approach to estimation below in section 3). The proposed exclusions build on findings from market analysis on which indicators are most frequently disclosed by companies 272 273 and rely on common and clear metrics which are possible to estimate in a harmonised way.\n\nPractical limitations to reach perfect comparability First, there are certain practical limitations to the levels of comparability which can be reached/required from products. Findings from the evaluation 274 show that there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 on how to granularly define what a positive contribution to a sustainability objective should be. This is mainly due to the wide variety of assets, strategies, sustainability objectives that exist in the current market. If a very granular and common (mandatory) approach to contribution was to be applied to all products regardless of their sustainability objective (e.g. minimum alignment with the EU Taxonomy), the investment universe would be too restricted, and the categories would not be usable (i.e. only a handful of products could be categorised). In other words, it would be counterproductive to micro-engineer what characteristics ESG products could have to this extent, both for product innovation and for ensuring a future-proof regulatory framework, for encouraging the offer of ESG products on the market, and ultimately for both the specific and general objectives of this initiative 275 . In fact, the potential of categories to simplify the framework for FMPs and to enhance the comparability of products and fight greenwashing would be significantly lowered if only a handful of EU products are categorised.\n\nTherefore, the suggested criteria focus on ensuring harmonised levels of contribution rather than granularly defining the nature of the contribution for them. This would also ensure continuity with what investment funds had to implement under the ESMA guidelines on funds\u2019 names (in application since May 2025). FMPs would be required to measure and disclose their assessment of performance against the objective that they contribute to. This should be based on credible and where possible science-based indicators 276 .\n\nIn addition to the measures described above, the Commission could be empowered to define a minimum ESG performance for certain sustainability objectives. In order to set this comparable minimum quantitative criterion on performance, two elements would be needed: (1) widely available data from underlying investments or otherwise estimable datapoints; (2) a politically agreed science-based target (e.g. minimum performance on GHG emissions for climate-related objectives) so that the law can set that minimum threshold unequivocally.\n\nPractical limitations to ensuring safeguards on certain sustainability topics: Second, the data availability issues described in the problem definition impact the amount of sustainability topics for which robust safeguards against greenwashing can be applied (for now). Even though the current DNSH covers 12 sustainability topics 277 , data availability issues have impacted the implementation of the current DNSH test and prevented the implementation of safeguards on issues for which no data was available. This has created the false perception that ESG products consider all possible ESG negative impacts despite the lack of requirements linked to the consideration of such impacts and the lack of available data to do so. Many stakeholders reported that they typically do not select PAIs that have less than 40% coverage (i.e. where they have underlying data for less than 40% of the portfolio). The PAIs for which the coverage is the lowest (as shown in box 12 of Annex 11) include biodiversity, water and waste. Therefore, the suggested safeguards, in the form of exclusions, only focus on sustainability topics for which reliable and comparable information can be derived (based on findings in Annex 11). While this approach would indeed lead to a reduction of mandatory sustainability aspects to be analysed, it is a necessary trade-off to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the criteria.\n\nTable 1: Key impacts of the proposed criteria (compared to current situation)\n\nCurrent situation\n\n\n\n\nIdentified legal limitations\n\n\t\n\nPractical impact\n\n\n\n\nNo minimum expectation regarding the positive contribution of the product.\n\n\t\n\nThe levels of sustainable investment can vary significantly.\n\nExample shown in Annex 11 (box 10): Products with very similar sustainability objectives report a portion of sustainable investment varying from 1% to 80%. Their levels of contribution are therefore not harmonised.\n\n\n\n\nNo harmonised approach on how to ensure no significant harm. In other words, FMPs are free to choose the way they consider their adverse impacts on the indicators provided in the SFDR delegated acts.\n\n\t\n\nThere is no guarantee that these products will not include harmful investment, despite having applied the \u2018do no significant harm\u2019 principle and appearing to be compliant with EU rules.\n\nNew situation under the proposed criteria\n\n\n\n\nProposed criteria\n\n\t\n\nPractical impact\n\n\n\n\nMandatory minimum proportion of the product to contribute to the sustainability objective\n\n\t\n\nThe levels of sustainable investment would be harmonised across all categorised products.\n\nThe specific thresholds are indicated below in section 1.2.\n\n\n\n\nMandatory common exclusions of harmful activities\n\n\t\n\nThere would be a list of industries or activities that products cannot invest in. This will guarantee no harmful investments (on topics for which binary exclusions are feasible and implementable).\n\n1.1.\nCRITERIA BUILT ON TWO PILLARS: POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION/AMBITION AND EXCLUSIONS\n\nPillar 1: positive contribution ensuring minimum levels of ESG ambition\n\nThis criterion relates to the current SFDR concepts of \u2018contribution\u2019 and \u2018environmental and social characteristics\u2019 - present in Articles 9 and 8 respectively - and aims at addressing the lack of legal clarity and greenwashing risks related to these concepts.\n\nFMPs would be free to choose their own sustainability objective(s) and how they plan to contribute to it/them, subject to proper transparency. However, a minimum threshold of the product\u2019s portfolio to be covered by the ESG strategy would be required:\n\n\uf0fcFMPs must clearly disclose their binding sustainability-related objective(s) and the strategy to achieve it/them\n\n\uf0fcThe binding objective(s) should consist of having a minimum level of investment above a certain threshold (i.e. portion of portfolio covered by the objective strategy)\n\n\uf0fcThe assessment of performance against this objective should be based on credible and where possible science-based indicators. Such measurement could leverage on existing PAI indicators (subject to improvements), and other ESG performance indicators which could be developed at level 2, and should be clearly disclosed in contractual documentation. .\n\n Pillar 2: exclusions ensuring minimum safeguards on certain ESG issues\n\nThis criterion relates to the current DNSH and good governance principles of the SFDR. It aims at moving away from the high-level concept of \u201cconsideration of principal adverse impact\u201d and setting clear binary exclusion criteria.\n\nThe negative criterion would take the form of a clear list of industries or activities that products cannot invest in. Such list would build on what is already applied under the ESMA guidelines on funds\u2019 names and would reflect a wide consensus of harmful industries and industries with high carbon footprints. 278\n\nSuch exclusions would make rules more consistent across the EU, harmonise the NCAs\u2019 supervisory expectations about what categorised products cannot invest in, and therefore enhance the comparability between such products, in line with investors\u2019 broadly signalled preferences regarding which sectors should be excluded (Annex 10).\n\nAlso, by focussing on fewer sustainability topics than the current DNSH, this approach would reduce the amount of data that FMPs need to collect 279 . The new minimum safeguards would focus on elements where data is available, making it more realistic to apply the principle in practice. Inevitably, the exclusions can and will not cover all the ESG aspects previously covered by the PAIs (e.g. biodiversity and water). FMPs could continue to identify and consider material negative outcomes on these topics on a best-effort basis.\n\n1.2.\nSUGGESTED DETAILED CRITERIA FOR EACH CATEGORY\n\nThe below largely builds on the criteria already introduced by the ESMA Guidelines on funds\u2019 names and reflects the current state of the market (see section 1.4 below). The suggested criteria also take account of the findings on data availability in the evaluation annex (more specifically the findings on box 12) and rely, as much as possible, on ESG concepts for which reliable and comparable sustainability information is available.\n\nSustainable category\n\n Positive contribution:\n\n\uf0fc FMPs must clearly identify and disclose the sustainability objective(s) (which could be climate, environmental or social related).\n\n\uf0fc FMPs must implement a binding investment strategy linked to this objective which needs to cover 70/80% of the product\u2019s portfolio 280 . FMP remain free to set their own strategy. The strategy would need to be substantiated and monitored by ESG key performance indicators (KPIs) defined by FMPs. The SFDR could provide a non-exhaustive list of ESG indicators (to be defined at level 2) on certain sustainability topics (e.g. GHG emissions, renewable energy, water, waste) which FMPs can use depending on their sustainability objective(s) 281 to monitor and disclose their ESG performance linked to their strategy. FMPs will remain free to use other indicators if these do not fit their sustainable objective(s) (e.g. qualitative objective linked to social issues) or their strategy (e.g. impact strategies needing tailored KPIs). A minimum alignment with the EU Taxonomy could for example be one of the ways FMPs can demonstrate their contribution to a climate or environmental objective (safe harbour).\n\nThe assessment of the performance against the chosen sustainability indicator(s) must be clearly disclosed in contractual documentation.\n\n Exclusions:\n\nThe product must apply exclusions based on those of the EU Paris-Aligned Benchmark (PAB)\n\nSocial safe-guards\n\n\uf0fd Activities related to controversial weapons\n\n\uf0fd Activities related to the cultivation and production of tobacco\n\n\uf0fd Companies in violation of the UN Global Compact (UN GC) principles or the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (also covering the existing good governance leg)\n\nClimate safe-guards\n\n\uf0fd Companies that derive 1% or more of their revenues from exploration, extraction, distribution or refining of hard coal and lignite\n\n\uf0fd Companies that derive 10 % or more of their revenues from the exploration, extraction, distribution or refining of oil fuels\n\n\uf0fd Companies that derive 50 % or more of their revenues from the exploration, extraction, manufacturing or distribution of gaseous fuels\n\n\uf0fd Companies that derive 50 % or more of their revenues from electricity generation with a GHG intensity of more than 100 g CO2 e/kWh\n\nIn addition, the exclusions would specify that investees cannot be engaged in activities involving fossil fuel expansion and should, where relevant, have a coal phase out plan.\n\nFMPs could continue to identify and consider material negative outcomes on other sustainability factors on a best-effort basis.\n\nTransition category\n\n Positive contribution:\n\n\uf0fc FMPs must clearly identify and disclose the transition objective(s) (which could be climate, environmental or social related).\n\n\uf0fc FMP must implement a binding transition strategy linked to this objective which needs to cover 70/80% of the product\u2019s portfolio. FMPs remain free to set their own strategy. For example, 70/80% of the portfolio could be invested in transitioning assets or could be covered by a transition strategy at the level of the portfolio (e.g. GHG emission reduction of the portfolio per year). The strategy would need to be monitored by ESG key performance indicators. The SFDR will provide a non-exhaustive list of indicators which FMPs can use to demonstrate how the strategy pursues this objective. These would build on existing market practices and the existing sustainable finance framework. For example, possible metrics to meet the transition objective could be: (a) a clear and measurable transition strategy at the level of the portfolio (e.g. a GHG emission reduction of x% per annum for products with climate transition objective); (b) investments in undertakings or economic activities with a credible transition plan, including science-based targets aligned with any sector-specific pathways and supported by other conditions (decarbonisation actions, financing etc.); (c) investments in Taxonomy-eligible activities with CapEx plan or partially aligned with the EU Taxonomy; (d) investment in portfolios tracking EU climate transition benchmarks (PAB/CTB); (e) investments in companies or economic activities without transition plan, provided that the FMP has put in place a credible, active and continued engagement strategy and that the investee companies demonstrate pre-defined credible measurable positive change in relation to the specified KPI.\n\n Exclusions:\n\nThe product must apply exclusions based on those of the EU Climate Transition Benchmarks (CTB):\n\nSocial safe-guards\n\n\uf0fd Activities related to controversial weapons\n\n\uf0fd Activities related to the cultivation and production of tobacco\n\n\uf0fd Companies in violation of the UN Global Compact (UN GC) principles or the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (also covering the existing good governance leg)\n\nIn addition, the exclusions would specify that investees cannot be engaged in activities involving fossil fuel expansion and should, where relevant, have a coal phase out plan. FMPs could continue to identify and consider material negative outcomes on other sustainability factors on a best-effort basis.\n\n\u2018Other ESG\u2019 category\n\n Positive contribution:\n\n\uf0fc FMP must implement a binding investment strategy (e.g. ESG process-based strategy) linked to the ESG claim made which needs to cover 70/80% of the product\u2019s portfolio. If needed, to support FMPs, examples of robust sustainable strategies could be provided via guidance. These examples could be the use of ESG ratings, a best-in-class strategy on a given ESG indicator, or outperforming the investment universe on a specific ESG indicator.\n\n Exclusions:\n\nThe product must apply exclusions based on those of the EU Climate Transition Benchmarks (CTB):\n\nSocial safe-guards\n\n\uf0fd Activities related to controversial weapons\n\n\uf0fd Activities related to the cultivation and production of tobacco\n\n\uf0fd Companies in violation of the UN Global Compact (UN GC) principles or the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (also covering the existing good governance principle)\n\nFMPs could continue to identify and consider material negative outcomes on other sustainability factors on a best-effort basis.\n\n1.3.\nEXAMPLES OF HOW THESE CRITERIA COULD BE IMPLEMENTED\n\nExamples of what products categorised under the sustainable category could look like based on the suggested criteria (for illustrative purposes):\n\nExample of a financial product with a climate-related objective:\n\n\u00b7\nPositive contribution on climate by investing in sustainable companies, projects or other assets supporting the development of solutions to tackle climate change issues.

This data is usually collected as part of FMPs\u2019 due diligence assessment.\n\no\nData needed for the articulation of the KPI chosen and defined by the FMP to substantiate and monitor the strategy (e.g. X% of revenues by portfolio companies to align with strategy and demonstrate progress toward achieving the objective of the product in terms of performance) can be found either: (1) in companies\u2019 disclosures under the CSRD (ESRS E1 \u2013 climate change) including disclosures for their Taxonomy-aligned activities (e.g. renewable energies, activities \u2018enabling\u2019 climate change mitigation etc) 282 ; (2) in companies\u2019 disclosures under the ISSB (IFRS S2 \u2013 climate-related disclosures) or other international standards 283 ; (3) can be derived from an external data provider (see section 3 part 1 below); or (4) estimated by the FMP using proprietary or open-source tools, appropriately explained (see section 3 part 2 below).\n\n\u00b7\nThe products commit not to invest in companies engaged in activities involving fossil fuel expansion as well as any economic activities/companies in violations of the PAB exclusions (described above).\n\no\nData needed for the assessment of the exclusions can be found (1) in companies\u2019 disclosures under the CSRD (ESRS mirror the PAB exclusions under ESRS E1-1/E1-6/E1-9; ESRS S1-1/S1-14/S1-16/S1-17/S2-1/S3-1/S4-1.

Based on their target market in terms of prospective investors, they can focus on sustainability issues on which companies disclose information or that they can derive or estimate as per above. In addition to the illustrative examples in section 1.3 above, for example, an FMP that choses to contribute to biodiversity would invest largely in companies that disclose information regarding their biodiversity performance or in companies that develop solutions to biodiversity issues (this information can be found in the general information and other disclosures of the company).\n\nFEASIBILITY OF THE EXCLUSION CRITERIA\n\nFirst, market analysis shows that the implementation of sectoral exclusions are the main elements of comparability today in funds with ESG characteristics or objectives.\n\nAccording to the Morningstar study, a key common trend among these funds is their low exposure to some controversial activities such as controversial weapons, tobacco, companies with severe controversies and with thermal coal\u00a0activities (see box 6). Similarly, the Frank Bold study 290 shows a high degree of harmonisation in core exclusions (and their related disclosures) linked to controversial weapons, thermal coal, tobacco and violations of UNGP and OECD Guidelines\u00a0for Multinational Enterprises. Studies show that these also tend to broadly align with investors\u2019 declared preferences (Annex 10).\u00a0\n\nBox 6: popular exclusions implemented by funds disclosing under Art.6, 8 and 9 291 \u00a0\n\nGraph 1: Article 6, 8, and 9 Funds' Involvement in Controversial Weapons\n\nGraph 2: Article 6, 8, and 9 funds\u2019 involvement in tobacco\n\nGraph 3: Article 6, 8, and 9 funds\u2019 involvement in severe controversies\n\nGraph 4: Article 6, 8, 9 funds involvement in thermal coal\n\nSecond, market analysis also shows that the PAB and CTB exclusions are generally reachable by a majority of funds that are likely to aim for a category.\n\nThe PSF report gives a first analysis of the potential impact of applying the PAB/CTB exclusions to funds that would likely aim at being categorised. It is to be noted that this study does not cover all products in scope of the SFDR (e.g. insurance and pension products are not assessed) and that there is some variability when comparing how many companies are to be excluded, mainly due to the lack of underlying data from funds and from varying implementation methods among FMPs and data providers.\n\nThe PSF initial findings show that out of 4,300 open-end funds and ETFs with ESG or sustainability-related terms in their names, 1,600 funds might potentially breach the PAB/CTB exclusions. Graph 1 of Box 7 shows the potential breaches of these 1,600 funds. It shows that the majority of these funds hold fewer than 5 stocks potentially in breach of the exclusion criteria.\n\nA similar study from Bloomberg gives an initial view of the average AUM that might be in breach of the PAB/CTB exclusions and indicates the main driver of exclusion. Graph 2 and 3 of Box 7 is based on a sample of 9,147 Article-8 and 814 Article-9 funds. It shows that the average AUM that would potentially need to be excluded are around 4% for the PAB exclusions and between 6 and 7% for the CTB exclusions. For the latter, the main driver of exclusions is the UNGC violations (which would be improved in any case to address the implementation challenges identified in the problem definition and evaluation annex).\n\nFinally, the PSF report analyses the specific impact of the PAB environmental exclusions on companies in certain industries. Box 8 shows that the energy sector would potentially be most affected by stock divestment if PAB exclusions are applied. This is mainly due to the exclusion criteria linked to energy generation above a certain GHG intensity 292 (to be noted that the industry would still be able to issue use of proceeds instruments that could be invested in by categorised products \u2013 see proposal below).\n\nBox 7: potential impact of the PAB/CTB exclusions on existing EU funds\n\nGraph 1: distribution of number of companies to be excluded from around 1,600 funds when applying PAB/CTB exclusion criteria\u00a0\n\nGraph 2: Impact of PAB exclusions on funds using sustainability, environmental and impact related terms\n\nSource: Bloomberg as of November 2024\n\nGraph 3: Impact of CTB exclusions on funds using social, transition or governance related terms\n\nSource: Bloomberg as of November 2024\n\nBox 8: impact of PAB exclusions on different industry\n\nSource: Morningstar Sustainalytics and Morningstar Direct, data as of May 2024, for industries only the top 10 are shown\n\nFinally, the PAB and CTB exclusions have already been implemented under the ESMA Guidelines on funds names by all funds using ESG-related terms in their name and the results of the implementation are positive.\n\nFund managers had until 21 May 2025 to either align with the requirements or change funds names to ensure compliance.\n\nThe scope of impacted funds varies from the different studies. In 2024, ESMA estimated the number of funds with ESG-related terms in their name at 6,490 while Morningstar estimated 4,570. The below relies on Morningstar findings using data from early May 2025 and March 2025 293 .\n\nAsset managers have taken various approaches to comply with the guidelines. Some have rebranded funds by replacing or removing ESG-related terms, with or without corresponding portfolio changes. Others have made minor adjustments, such as divesting from companies that don\u2019t meet the requirements.\n\n\u00d8\nImpact on the funds\u2019 name\n\nA year after the release of the final ESMA fund naming guidelines, the universe of EU open-end funds and ETFs with ESG-related terms in their names has dropped by only about 8% to an estimated 4,220.\n\nThe paper estimates that at least 880 funds, or 19% of in-scope funds, have rebranded so far, including 508 that have dropped ESG terms, 304 that have replaced one ESG-related term with another, and 68 that have added an ESG term. Passive funds have been disproportionally affected. Among those that dropped ESG-related terms, about 200, or 40%, adopted non-ESG alternatives such as \u201cscreened\u201d, \u201cselect\u201d, or \u201ccommitted\u201d, suggesting that managers remain keen to signal ESG characteristics through fund names.\n\nThe most frequently removed terms are \u201cESG\u201d and \u201csustainable,\u201d while terms such as \u201ctransition,\u201d \u201cclimate,\u201d and \u201cscreened\u201d have gained in popularity.\n\n\u00d8\nImpact on the funds\u2019 portfolio\n\nLooking at March 2025 portfolios, the impact of the guidelines' exclusion rules on in-scope funds is already evident. The number of funds holding \u201ccontentious\u201d stocks has declined compared with a year ago 294 .\n\nThe exhibits below highlight 25 of the most commonly held \u201ccontentious\u201d companies in the sample\u2019 portfolio in 2024 and in 2025 (see method in footnote), showing the number of funds holding each stock, their average portfolio weight, the aggregate holding value and the main reasons for exclusions. Overall, the number of funds holding these stocks declined from May 2024 to March 2025, accompanied in many cases by a decrease in both average portfolio weight and aggregate holding value. It is fair to assume that part of the decline can be attributed to stock divestments made to comply with the ESMA guidelines.\n\nThe paper also conducts the same analysis focussing on funds that have retained ESG-related terms in their names. This reduced universe of approximately 2,590 funds is required to completely divest from stocks in breach of the ESMA guidelines. As expected, there are more divestments (in relative terms). For example, the number of funds holding TotalEnergies shares dropped by 34% between May 2024 and March 2025 (to 139 from 210), compared with the 24% decrease seen earlier among the full sample of funds with complete portfolio holdings over the observation period. Similar divestment outcomes were found in other energy stocks including Neste (47% versus 41%, previously), Repsol (30% versus 23%), Galp Energia (30% versus 18%), and Eni (45% versus 28%).\n\nWhile we can expect some of the stocks listed below to no longer feature in these portfolios going forward, others may remain due to differing interpretations of the rules and variations in data sources.\n\n\u00d8\nPreliminary conclusions\n\nIt can be concluded that the ESMA guidelines on funds names had a significant impact in the claims made by FMPs both in the names and portfolio constructions. The fact that the universe of funds using ESG-related terms only decreased by 8% shows that most of funds in scope managed to implement the ESMA criteria.\n\nIf the criteria for the categories build on the ESMA criteria, most of the one-off implementation cost would have already been borne by funds in scope of the ESMA guidelines.\n\nSECTION 2: UNDERLYING DISCLOSURES FOR THE CATEGORIES PROPOSED UNDER OPTION 2.2\n\nThere is considerable evidence from the consultations that the vast majority of end-investors would be better served by shorter and more focused information. This is also confirmed by the findings of Annex 10.\n\nOption 2.2 therefore moves away from relying on standardised questions for all ESG financial products and suggests refocussing the templates on fewer indicators and sustainability topics which are relevant for investors\u2019 decision. Consumer-facing disclosures should provide consumers with information on the key sustainability characteristics of products in a simple, accessible, consumer-friendly way. This would also allow for an easier comparability of products with an easy-to-use source of information. Together with the categories, this would help them assess whether products meet their needs and preferences.\n\nOption 2.2 is therefore coherent with the creation of categories, with disclosures tailored to the categories under which products fall (i.e. specific disclosures would depend on whether a product is largely composed of sustainable assets, or transitioning assets, or if the product implements other ESG processes). The disclosures would rely on clear, measurable and usable concepts (i.e. the suggested criteria described above) and on ESG concepts for which information is either available from investee companies or possible to estimate.\n\nThe below suggests to focus the specific disclosures on the underlying criteria of each category. This would allow investors to clearly understand (1) the ambition to be expected from categorised products; (2) the specific sustainability objective and its accompanying strategy; (3) what the product does not invest in for sustainability-related reasons. On top of that, a short set of ESG KPIs (e.g. 3 KPIs) would allow consumers to compare products based on topics that are deemed relevant depending on the category. These KPIs would need to rely on sustainability topics for which information is either available from investee companies or possible to reliably estimate by FMPs/data providers when the information is missing.\n\nThe below provides mock templates for illustrative purposes only. The detailed elements and final design of the template should be developed at a later stage at level 2 to allow for additional consumer studies to be conducted.\u00a0\n\nProduct Name 295\n\n\n\n\nSustainable Category\n\n\u201cTo qualify for the sustainable category, a financial product must contribute to a sustainability objective and meet EU minimum standards on climate and social issues.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the sustainability objective(s)?\n\nShort description.

Due to data shortages the use of estimates will be inevitable and is already part of current market practices\u00a0 298 . In fact, the investable universe for financial products always extended beyond listed and larger EU companies, including non-EU companies and assets that are not covered by EU reporting rules. No EU legislation such as the CSRD would have ever closed this data gap.\n\nWhile estimations always carry some levels of greenwashing risks, these risks can be reduced by the following possible measures:\n\n1.\nFocussing the criteria and the disclosures on ESG concepts which are possible to estimate.\n\nA key issue linked with estimations under the current SFDR is the nature of certain datapoints which cannot be estimated when the information is not available. Examples include the principal adverse impact on \u2018board gender diversity\u2019, defined as the average ratio of female to male board members in investee companies, expressed as a percentage of all board members. If the company does not disclose/communicate its board composition, FMPs/external providers cannot reasonably estimate such data.\n\nTo lower the risk of incorrect/weak estimation, the SFDR criteria and disclosures should focus on sustainability data points for which estimation is possible (e.g. which are binary or where using sectoral and geographical averages is possible) and where market practices are well established.\n\nMain findings on the positive state of play of estimations on exclusions:\n\nThe Platform for Sustainable Finance ran a survey 299 with data vendors to assess the comparability of data that an institutional investor would receive when retrieving the best available relevant data from a range of vendors to report on a global portfolio. The survey was carried out via an open call to capture the current state of affairs for data availability and quality as offered by different data vendors. A random sample of EU and non-EU securities were chosen that was large enough for statistically relevant analysis (N=300).\n\nThe survey concluded that\u00a0high levels of consistency were found in the estimations of exclusion across vendors, with 80% of issuers showing 0% divergence in their estimations of PAB exclusions.\n\nCommon market practices on the estimations of the PAB exclusions include the use of sector average, or modelling using business activity and exposure (e.g. looking at the average emissions per revenue or per employee of companies in the same NAICS sector, similar production size and same energy mix). Most market practices include the implementation of the precautionary principle 300 , see chart below.\n\n2.\nAdditional disclosures around estimation practices from FMPs\n\nWhen FMPs generate their own estimations, the SFDR could introduce similar obligations to the transparency requirements for estimations under the Benchmark Delegated Regulation\u00a0 301 . These include disclosures on the research and calculation methodology, on assumptions underlying estimates and precautionary principles, on the use of external data providers. The elements to be disclosed by the FMPs would be part of the products\u2019 legal documentations and will therefore be supervised by NCAs (as it is the case for SFDR disclosures today) who, in contrast to today, would thus be provided with clearer information to judge whether the estimates are robust enough.\n\nFor cases when FMPs use an external provider, FMPs could instead be asked to disclose the proportion of information estimated vs information not estimated. This is because estimation methodologies are normally not disclosed by data providers for competition reasons.\n\nOther possible measures to limit greenwashing risks linked to estimations, such as regulating third-party providers or ESG data products, do not emerge as major shortcomings from the evaluation carried out for the review, would be at odds with the objectives of the targeted review of the SFDR as a simplification initiative by extending its regulatory scope, and were thus deemed as incompatible with the simplification and burden reduction agenda or already discarded in past impact assessment\u00a0 302 . Beyond the steps to formalise the practice of reliance on estimates, and to base this practice on datapoints which are most available and of interest to investors, there is little evidence to suggest that extending the regulatory perimeter of the SFDR to ESG data providers would help bring down costs further. Rather it can be expected that any costs of additional regulatory would be passed on through data users across the investment chain, adding to overall costs of ESG investing. It could thus be ineffective, incoherent and counterproductive to undertake piecemeal regulatory steps to any address issues in data providers\u2019 business models, solely involving their ESG data.\n\nChart on the implementation of the precautionary principle to estimate GHG emissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnex 9: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Examples of existing ESG labelling regimes and ESG rules by NCAs or label providers\n\nA.\nExamples of NCAs practices\n\nNCA\n\n\t\n\nScope\n\n\t\n\nCriteria\n\n\n\n\nAMF (France) Doctrine 303\n\n\t\n\nMandatory for retail funds established in France.\n\nNon-French funds have to include a disclaimer in their marketing material if they do not comply\n\n\t\n\nThree types of funds, depend on how active product provider can communicate around ESG:\n\nType 3: funds which do not take into account (or lightly) non-financial criteria required to limit the communication around extra-financial criteria to their prospectus;\n\nType 2: funds which take extra-financial criteria into account without taking a significant commitment require -measurable objectives for consideration of non-financial criteria (a discretionary rate of exclusion for the selectivity approach) - higher rating indicator or extra-financial analysis than investment universe -minimum of 90% of the assets must be provided with extra-financial ratings and analysis or 75% for emerging markets.\n\nType 1: funds which significantly commit to take into account extra-financial criteria requires specific binding measurable objectives for consideration of non-financial criteria (20% exclusion of the worst assets for the selectivity approach for instance) and a minimum of 90% of the assets must be provided with extra-financial ratings and analysis.\n\n\n\n\nBaFin (Germany) Guidance (no published final version; administrative practice similar to consultation paper) 304\n\n\t\n\nGerman retail funds which use an ESG related term in the name or are marketed explicitly as sustainable\n\n\t\n\nAlternative 1\n\n1.\nCompliance with a minimum investment ratio in sustainable assets (75 %)\n\n2.\nDNSH including specified exclusions (e.g. < 10% fossil fuels (ex gas); < 5% coal, oil; 0% oil sand / shale)\n\n3.\nGood governance\n\nAlternative 2\n\n1.\nAdherence to a sustainable investment strategy, e.g. best in class (75%)\n\n2.\nDNSH including specified exclusions (e.g. < 10% fossil fuels (ex gas); < 5% coal, oil; 0% oil sand / shale)\n\n\n\n\nFinansinspektionen (Sweden) and FSA (Denmark)\n\n\t\n\nAll products within the ESMA guidelines on funds name\n\n\t\n\nAlthough the ESMA clarified 305 in December 2024 that a \u2018meaningful\u2019 allocation to sustainable investments should be at least 50%, regulators in in Sweden and Denmark impose higher thresholds of 80% and 85% respectively.\n\nB.\nExamples of existing labels in the EU 306 \u00a0\n\nName and region\n\n\t\n\nProducts\n\n\t\n\nCriteria\n\n\n\n\nCDP Climatrics 307\n\n\t\n\nFunds\n\n\t\n\n- Rating based on the environmental impact, transparency, and performance of their portfolio companies.\n- Score components relate to climate, water, and forest.\n- A fund\u2019s portfolio score is the portfolio weighted average of the underlying holdings\u2019 company scores.\n\n\n\n\nEcolabel UZ 49 (Austria) 308\n\n\t\n\nFunds, IBIPs, Green Bonds, savings products\n\n\t\n\n- Exclusion relating to nuclear, armaments, fossil fuels, genetic engineering, human rights violations, lack of minimum commitment to labour standards.

This covers anti-greenwashing rules for all authorised firms, requirements for sustainability-related claims to be fair, clear and not misleading, naming and marketing rules for investment funds making ESG claims, as well as four labels to help investors navigate the investment product landscape: (i) sustainability focus (products mainly investing in assets that are already sustainable); (ii) sustainability improvers (products mainly investing in transitioning assets); (iii) sustainability impact (products mainly aiming at a very targeted contribution); and (iv) a mixed category.\u00a0\n\nResearch published by the Investment Association in early 2025 316 \u00a0compared responses from 50 UK firms regarding implementation of the new rules.\n\nKey findings:\n\n\u00b7\nOver a third (39%) of firms have adopted an SDR label\u00a0for at least one of their funds, although the figure is less than anticipated in a prior survey (106 labelled funds in the market compared to the anticipated 216).\n\n\u00b7\nSustainability Focus is the most popular label, with 63 funds approved, followed by Sustainability Impact (22), Sustainability Improvers (17) and Sustainability Mixed Goals (4).\n\n\u00b7\nFund labelling process has improved transparency. Almost all (91%) surveyed firms adopting an SDR label have updated the labelled fund\u2019s investment policy or strategy to be more transparent on the fund\u2019s sustainability approach, and 83% have added a sustainability investment objective for at least one fund.\u00a039% of firms agree that the SDR regime will make it easier for investors to find and compare non-labelled funds with sustainability characteristics. In addition, 35% of firms agree that the SDR framework gives sufficient flexibility to accommodate different types of sustainable investment approaches. Further research from the Investment Association and The Wisdom Council found that almost all (94%) retail investors with a propensity for sustainable investing agreed that they would find the labelling regime helpful.\n\n\u00b7\nSome challenges are however also noted. Almost half (49%) of firms have at least one fund that they considered adopting a label for but later decided against it, with a third (32%) making this decision after going through the authorisation process (firms who successfully applied for a label are said to have had to resubmit applications on average three times for their first labelled fund).\u00a0Firms are also unsure if SDR will lead to more money invested into these products. Just 14% of firms agreed that the SDR regime will result in more capital flows into sustainable funds over the next three years.\n\n\u00b7\nBeyond the labels, naming and marketing rules are said to have had a broader impact, as non-labelled funds with sustainability characteristics cover a larger market share than labelled funds. 80% of survey respondents have non-labelled funds that are subject to additional disclosure requirements under the naming and marketing rules. At least 340 funds fall into this bucket, more than three times as many funds as those which have a label.\u00a0The most common approaches taken by these funds are negative/exclusionary screening (83%), ESG integration (75%) and positive tilt (55%).\u00a0Over half (55%) of firms had to make changes to their funds as a result of the naming and marketing rules, with almost a third (28%) replacing a restricted term with a non-restricted term in the fund name, and a quarter (26%) removing a restricted term from a fund name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnex 10: Findings from consumer testing studies\n\nExecutive summary\n\nIn the context of the ongoing SFDR assessment, we have analysed existing studies/surveys on retail investors\u2019 sustainability objectives and understanding. This finding should support our impact assessment when considering potential changes to ESG disclosures and the potential set up of sustainability-related categories for financial products. This analysis focuses on high level elements; more granular aspects of retail investors\u2019 preferences should be analysed in preparation of potential level 2 rules which are difficult to predict at this stage.\n\nKey findings include: (1) strong appetite for sustainable products; (2) main drivers for such appetite are financial returns/economic outlook, personal values and wanting to have a positive impact; (3) there are a wide range of sustainability objectives/themes that retail investors want to see reflected in sustainable products, covering both environmental and social issues; (4) main barriers to ESG investing today are the fear of greenwashing due to inadequate ESG disclosures (length, complexity, technical jargon).\n\nWhile the existing studies present some limitations (e.g. global samples rather than EU only, small samples, targeted populations that might not reflect the average retail investors\u2026), they already give us an idea of what EU retail investors might be interested in and their expectations. The below summarises all existing studies that we have found.\n\n1.\nInvestors\u2019 interest in sustainable investing is high\n\nPreliminary conclusion: recent data confirms that consumers\u2019 interest in sustainable investment products remains strong.\n\nGlobal/EU statistics:\n\n\u00b7\nGlobally, more than three quarters (77%) of global investors are interested in sustainable investing. 57% say their interest increased in the last two years and 54% anticipate increasing their sustainable investments in the next year 317 .\n\n\u00b7\nIn Europe (UK, France, Germany, Switzerland), 85% individual investors declared being interested in sustainable investing 318 .\n\n\u00b7\n55% of EU investors surveyed\u00a0are interested in sustainable finance solutions 319 .\n\n\u00b7\nMore than 60% of Europeans find it important that their savings and investments do not fund economic activities that have a negative impact on the planet. However, only 34% knew whether their private savings and investments were invested into sustainable economic activities, and 29% received information on the sustainability impact of financial products or services 320 .\n\nNational statistics\n\n\u00b7\n59% of Belgian investors would include sustainable investments in a mixed portfolio, while 28% would prefer a fully sustainable portfolio. 13% would invest only in traditional/non-sustainable investments. 321\n\n\u00b7\n66% of French investors say that sustainable development issues are important for them. 75% of respondents say that the impact of investments on the environment is an important issue 322 .\n\n\u00b7\n58% of German investors would prefer funds that take some ESG criteria into account, while 8% prefer conventional (no ESG) fund. 33% of respondents prefer savings account over any investment fund. 323 \u00a0\n\n\u00b7\nEU investors 324 in the survey were asked: \u201cCompared to five years ago, how important has sustainable investing become to you?\u201d.\n\nOn average, EU investors responded: 77% more important, 20% no change, 3% less important.\n\nParticipants from different countries responded:\n\n-\nAustria: 77% more important, 21% no change, 3% less important\n\n-\nBelgium: 69% more important, 27% no change, 4% less important\n\n-\nDenmark: 74% more important, 21% no change, 6% less important\n\n-\nFrance: 79% more important, 19% no change, 3% less important\n\n-\nGermany: 78% more important, 19% no change, 2% less important\n\n-\nItaly: 72% more important, 26% no change, 2% less important\n\n-\nNetherlands: 72% more important, 25% no change, 3% less important\n\n-\nPoland: 81% more important, 17% no change, 2% less important\n\n-\nPortugal: 85% more important, 14% no change, 2% less important\n\n-\nSpain: 81% more important, 18% no change, 1% less important\n\n-\nSweden: 80% more important, 17% no change, 3% less important\n\n\u00b7\nFurthermore, they were asked: \u201cCompared to five years ago, how have your investments in sustainable investment funds changed?\u201d. Responds follow:\n\n-\nAustria: 55% Increase, 32% no change, 6% decrease\n\n-\nBelgium: 54% Increase, 32% no change, 8% decrease\n\n-\nDenmark: 54% Increase, 29% no change, 10% decrease\n\n-\nFrance: 63% Increase, 26% no change, 7% decrease\n\n-\nGermany: 61% Increase, 31% no change, 5% decrease\n\n-\nItaly: 55% Increase, 32% no change, 7% decrease\n\n-\nNetherlands: 56% Increase, 33% no change, 6% decrease\n\n-\nPoland: 59% Increase, 32% no change, 7% decrease\n\n-\nPortugal: 63% Increase, 27% no change, 6% decrease\n\n-\nSpain: 61% Increase, 32% no change, 4% decrease\n\n-\nSweden: 70% Increase, 21% no change, 5% decrease\n\n\u00b7\nAnother survey 325 explored the interest in sustainable finance solutions among European investors:\n\n-\n55% of Belgian investors are interested in sustainable finance solutions, 18% are not interested, and 27% are indifferent.\n\n-\n55% of Spanish investors are interested in sustainable finance solutions, 16% are not interested, and 29% are indifferent.\n\n-\n55% of Italian investors are interested in sustainable finance solutions, 18% are not interested, and 26% are indifferent.\n\n-\n49% of Dutch investors are interested in sustainable finance solutions, 23% are not interested, and 29% are indifferent.\n\n-\n65% of Polish investors are interested in sustainable finance solutions, 14% are not interested, and 22% are indifferent.\n\n-\n65% of Swedish investors are interested in sustainable finance solutions, 10% are not interested, and 25% are indifferent.\n\n2.\nDrivers of the demand\n\nPreliminary conclusion: while financial returns remain the bigger driver for investing, retail investors do not necessarily associate sustainable investing with lower return/compromise on return. Main drivers\u00a0for investing include financial performance, risk management, supporting green objectives and creating a positive impact. Investors\u2019 willingness-to-pay for sustainable investments depends on the impact of such investments. 326\n\nGlobal/EU statistics:\n\n\u00b7\nGlobally, investors believe strong ESG practices can lead to higher returns. Financial returns are the main priority for global individual investors, and 70% believe strong ESG practices deliver them 327 .\n\n\u00b7\nWhen asked about reasons for interest in sustainable investing, European investors (UK, France, Germany, Switzerland), mentioned, in order of preferences: (1) financial performance of sustainable investment (57%), (2) inflation (56%), (3) market dynamics and broader economic performance (54%) and new climate science findings (53%) 328 .\n\nNational statistics:\n\n\u00b7\nWhen asked why to consider sustainability in the portfolio, Belgian investors highlighted different drivers: 37% cited personal values as their primary motivation, 30% were driven by the desire to create a positive impact, 29% focused on risk management, and 22% would not include sustainability 329 .\n\n\u00b7\nWhen Austrian investors were asked about their reasons for investing in sustainable investment funds, 31% cited potential profit as their primary motivation, 36% pointed to the positive social, societal, or environmental impact, and 33% expressed that both factors were equally important.\n\n\u00b7\nWhen Belgian investors were asked about their reasons for investing in sustainable investment funds, 33% cited potential profit as their primary motivation, 31% pointed to the positive social, societal, or environmental impact, and 36% expressed that both factors were equally important.\n\n\u00b7\nWhen Danish investors were asked about their reasons for investing in sustainable investment funds, 34% cited potential profit as their primary motivation, 33% pointed to the positive social, societal, or environmental impact, and 33% expressed that both factors were equally important.\n\n\u00b7\nWhen French investors were asked about their reasons for investing in sustainable investment funds, 29% cited potential profit as their primary motivation, 40% pointed to the positive social, societal, or environmental impact, and 31% expressed that both factors were equally important.\n\n\u00b7\nWhen German investors were asked about their reasons for investing in sustainable investment funds, 31% cited potential profit as their primary motivation, 32% pointed to the positive social, societal, or environmental impact, and 38% expressed that both factors were equally important.\n\n\u00b7\nWhen Italian investors were asked about their reasons for investing in sustainable investment funds, 27% cited potential profit as their primary motivation, 38% pointed to the positive social, societal, or environmental impact, and 35% expressed that both factors were equally important.\n\n\u00b7\nWhen Dutch investors were asked about their reasons for investing in sustainable investment funds, 33% cited potential profit as their primary motivation, 33% pointed to the positive social, societal, or environmental impact, and 33% expressed that both factors were equally important.\n\n\u00b7\nWhen Polish investors were asked about their reasons for investing in sustainable investment funds, 31% cited potential profit as their primary motivation, 35% pointed to the positive social, societal, or environmental impact, and 34% expressed that both factors were equally important.\n\n\u00b7\nWhen Portuguese investors were asked about their reasons for investing in sustainable investment funds, 32% cited potential profit as their primary motivation, 38% pointed to the positive social, societal, or environmental impact, and 31% expressed that both factors were equally important.\n\n\u00b7\nWhen Spanish investors were asked about their reasons for investing in sustainable investment funds, 31% cited potential profit as their primary motivation, 35% pointed to the positive social, societal, or environmental impact, and 34% expressed that both factors were equally important.\n\n\u00b7\nWhen Swedish investors were asked about their reasons for investing in sustainable investment funds, 36% cited potential profit as their primary motivation, 32% pointed to the positive social, societal, or environmental impact, and 32% expressed that both factors were equally important. 330\n\n\u00b7\nEven among those who do expect a reduction in financial returns from sustainable investments (30%), the majority (69%) wants to put their pension money to promote sustainability. 331\n\n3.\nSpecific sustainability objectives/themes\n\nPreliminary conclusion: Data confirms an interest for both environmental and social issues. Commitment to transition efforts seems to be important for retail investors. Overall, data shows a wide range of sustainability-related interests amongst retail investors. Data shows support for both exclusion-based criteria and positive contribution based criteria.\n\nGlobal/EU statistics:\n\n\u00b7\nWhen asked about specific themes, global investors favor environmental solutions for current and planned investments, while interest in social themes is tempered by uncertainty on how to invest. Water solutions, healthcare and climate action are top themes for investors, but there\u2019s broad interest across many environmental and social areas 332 .\n\n\u00b7\n82% of global investors believe companies should address environmental issues, 77% of them believe companies should address social issues. 333\n\n\u00b7\nThe top themes for sustainable investing among surveyed European investors (UK, France, Germany, Switzerland) are: Climate action (17%), Healthcare (12%), Water solutions (11%), Circular economy (9%), Nature & biodiversity (9%), Education (8%), Financial Inclusion (7%), UN SDGs (5%), Multicultural Diversity (5%), Just Transition (5%), Gender Diversity (4%), Community Development (4%), Faith-Based Values (3%). 334 \u00a0\n\n\u00b7\nAnother survey on the popularity of sustainable topics among European investors (Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, and Romania) shows that most popular remain: Clean water (64%), Health and safety (62%), Education (53%), Climate change (51%), Renewable energy and energy efficiency (50%), Human rights (45%). 335 \u00a0\n\n\u00b7\nEuropean respondents (UK, France, Germany, Switzerland) are the most likely to consider climate change when investing in traditional energy companies, at 77% (vs 71% for the US and 69% for Japan). 336 \u00a0\n\n\u00b7\nGlobal retail investors have certain preferences regarding ESG investing strategy: 47% of them prefer exclusionary screening or values-based exclusions, 37% best-in-class selection, while 16% prefers impact investing. 337\n\n\u00b7\n72% of European value-oriented retail investors are found to prefer both exclusion (negative) and contribution (positive) screening criteria for investments, 20% were only interested in exclusion and a minority of 9% were only interested in positive screening. Human rights and other governance violations were found as the most important exclusion-based criteria, with various social and environmental metrics as the preferred positive criteria 338 .\n\n\u00b7\nEU investors have been asked \u201cWhich of these phrases describe what you think a \u201csustainable investment fund\u201d is?\u201d\n\na.\nFund that invests in companies that are likely to be more profitable because they are proactive in preparing for environmental and social changes\n\nb.\nFund that invests in companies that are best-in-class when it comes to environmental or social issues or how the company is managed\n\nc.\nFund that specifically avoids controversial companies\n\nd.\nAll three descriptors\n\ne.\nDon\u2019t know 339 \u00a0\n\nOn average, EU investors predominantly responded:\n\n-\na) Fund that invests in companies that are likely to be more profitable because they are proactive in preparing for environmental and social changes. (47%)\n\n-\nb) Fund that invests in companies that are best-in-class when it comes to environmental or social issues or how the company is managed.

Three overarching objectives were considered: impact, values, and return.

The Delegated Regulation specifies\u00a0notably the details of the information to be disclosed to investors in pre-contractual documents, on websites and in periodic reports regarding key parameters and indicators set out in the level 1 Regulation\u00a0both for financial market participants as entities as well as for the financial products which they make available. This includes notably regarding how products may be considered to promote environmental or social characteristics under Article 8, to pursue sustainable investment as an objective under Article 9, and to consider principal adverse impacts to sustainability, including adherence to the principle of \u2018do no significant harm\u2019.\n\nWhile the level 1 Regulation is applicable since March 2021, the detailed level 2 Delegated Regulation applies only since early 2023. Overall, the rules both across the level 1 and the level 2 are closely linked with other parts of the EU sustainable finance framework, notably the Taxonomy Regulation 371 and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive 372 , including their respective implementing measures which have entered into application in various steps between 2022 and 2025 373 .\u00a0\n\nThe comprehensive assessment of the SFDR was announced in December 2022 374 as per Article 19 of the regulation to assess potential shortcomings with the framework, focusing on legal certainty, the usability of the regulation and its ability to play its part in tackling greenwashing. The assessment was carried forward notably via two public consultations in autumn 2023 375 as well as the other steps outlined in Annex 1.\n\nThe assessment has been predicated on gathering feedback on the functioning of the framework and assessing any shortcomings with regard to how well it is achieving its ultimate objectives. Notably this concerns how the rules are working in terms of helping to attract private funding to facilitate the transition of the European economy towards greater sustainability by setting out a common framework for disclosures by financial market participants regarding their investment activities and the sustainability-features of various financial products and empowering investors to better understand and compare the products on offer.\n\nThis annex summarises the assessment of the extent to which the existing SFDR rules have met their main objectives and in particular whether they have worked in a way that is efficient, effective, coherent, relevant and have provided EU added value. The assessment has largely been conducted prior to the impact assessment work, and its results have been incorporated in the problem definition of the impact assessment.\n\n1.2.\nScope of the evaluation\n\nThis annex does not constitute a full evaluation of the SFDR. The detailed rules in the Delegated Regulation date from 2023, which together with their interplay with the detailed concurrent implementing measures under the Taxonomy and CSRD noted above (dating from 2022 to 2025), make a full evaluation of their effect in accordance with better regulation principles premature. As such, this annex provides an assessment of the functioning of the SFDR, to the extent possible in accordance with the five evaluation criteria set out in Better regulation guidelines, and informing also the problem definition in section 2 of this impact assessment.\n\n1.3.\nBackground to the initiative\n\nThe Commission proposal for the SFDR was adopted in May 2018 376 . It set out to overcome \u201ca lack of transparency on how institutional investors, asset\u00a0managers and financial advisors consider sustainability risks in their investment decision-making or advisory processes (as a result of which) their clients do not get the full information they need to inform their investment decisions or recommendations.\u201d Together with the other measures in the EU sustainable finance framework, the SFDR was part of the steps to help reorient capital towards sustainable investments and mainstream sustainability into financial risk management 377 .\n\nThe expected impacts of the SFDR were that end-investors would be provided with more clear and coherent information, with lower information asymmetries and search costs, on how financial market participants and financial advisors integrate sustainability risks in their investment decision-making or advisory processes. This was also foreseen to help incentivise innovation, competition and ultimately market efficiency due to a better integration of ESG risks and consideration of higher sustainability standards in the decision-making processes of investors and financial market participants and advisers alike. It was anticipated that additional costs under the framework for financial market participants and financial advisers would largely be incurred\u00a0as part of existing and emerging organisational and operating procedures, which were already tending towards a better consideration of sustainability risks. Costs were also anticipated to be offset by gains from higher volumes of client business interested in sustainable investments. While the final SFDR adopted by co-legislators and published in December 2019 amended the Commission proposal in several respects and key details 378 , the fundamental objectives of the framework remained the same.\n\n1.4.\nState of play\n\nAs noted above, the SFDR Level 1 began applying in March 2021 but the detailed rules in the Level 2 regulation only began applying in early 2023. Together with subsequent Level 3 guidance from the Commission and ESAs, this meant that the early implementation of the SFDR entailed periodic adjustments for FMPs notably regarding the appropriate treatment and disclosures of certain products (outlined in sections 1 and 2 of the impact assessment and further in section 3.1.2 below).\n\nNonetheless, the feedback on the SFDR shows continued widespread support for both its objectives and the added value of a common sustainability disclosure framework at EU level. Some stakeholders consider that it has been effective in increasing transparency and giving investors access to detailed ESG information.\n\nNevertheless, a large majority of stakeholders note that there are limitations in the SFDR which have prevented the objectives of the framework from being fully achieved. These limitations include a lack of legal clarity on key concepts, the limited relevance of certain disclosure requirements, overlaps and inconsistencies with other parts of the sustainable finance framework, and challenges linked to data availability.\n\nOverall, these limitations have led to various implementation challenges and undue operational costs for financial market participants. They have also led to a lack of clarity and comparability regarding the sustainability of different financial products offered to investors in the EU. This in turn has given rise to both a risk of greenwashing and the unwarranted exclusion of some sectors because of how some rules are applied in practice. This has made the rules less effective in helping to mobilise private investment into the transition toward sustainable business practices and the EU\u2019s strategic objectives.\n\n2.\nMethodology\n\nThis evaluation annex summarises the input and analysis which have gone into informing the assessment of the functioning of the SFDR recapped above, to the extent possible through the lens of the five evaluation criteria set out in Better regulation guidelines. It is based on the feedback to the consultations and outreach activities outlined in Annexes 1 and 2, as well as other publicly available studies and inputs received by Commission services. An analysis of the costs arising from the current regime is presented separately in Annex 3.\n\n3.\nEvaluation questions\n\nThe first part (section 3.1) below \u2013 looking at effectiveness, efficiency and coherence \u2013 explores the extent to which the SFDR has been successful. The second and third explore its continued relevance (section 3.2) and added value (section 3.3).\n\n3.1.\nTo what degree has the SFDR been successful, in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and coherence?\n\n3.1.1.\nEffectiveness and efficiency\n\nHas the SFDR been overall effective in delivering on its objectives and if not, what factors have rendered it less effective than intended?\n\nHas the SFDR been cost-efficient? Is there scope to increase efficiency e.g. via further simplification or making the rules more proportionate?\n\nThe feedback to the consultations shows continued support for the objectives of the SFDR but mixed views on how the implementation of the regulation has delivered against its specific objectives 379 . A majority considered that the SFDR has not effectively strengthened protection for end-investors or made it easier for them to compare financial products with sustainability claims nor that it has successfully directed capital towards investments deemed sustainable, including transitional investments. In detail, in terms of the effectiveness and efficiency of the SFDR in delivering on its objectives, the entity level disclosure requirements for FMPs and financial advisers (jointly referred to as \u2018FMPs\u2019 below) and product level disclosure requirements\u00a0for financial products in scope 380 \u00a0on how they consider sustainability risks, are widely perceived as complex, unduly long and lacking in clarity.\u00a0The requirements are also said to require a level of ESG data which is not fully and effectively available, with inadequate guidance on how to treat resulting ESG data gaps. The disclosure regime is also being used by the market as a de facto labelling system despite the lack of common criteria that could underpin such labels and be fit for this purpose.\n\nTogether, these pose difficulties both for FMPs in preparing the required disclosures and navigating the uncertainty surrounding key sustainability-related obligations and concepts, as well as for investors and distributors in understanding and comparing ESG claims made as part of financial products. While not fully cancelling out the ability of the SFDR to deliver on some of its objectives, these challenges hamper its overall effectiveness and efficiency in ensuring a more integrated single market for credible ESG-linked products helping to mobilise private investment into the transition toward sustainability and for the EU\u2019s other strategic objectives.\n\n\u00d8\nThe SFDR is considered to rely on ambiguous terminologies and un-defined concepts which have led to unclear requirements.\n\n82% (247 out of 301) of respondents to the public consultations flagged that the legal requirements and concepts in the SFDR, especially the ones linked to the definition of \u2018sustainable investment\u2019, are not sufficiently clear 381 . The sustainable investment definition leaves a lot of room for interpretation, especially when it comes to the \u2018do no significant harm\u2019 (DNSH) concept 382 . The regulation has not specified what the requirements linked to the \u2018consideration\u2019 of \u2018principal adverse impacts\u2019 (PAIs) means, which is left to the discretion of asset managers (e.g. setting specific thresholds for each PAI, engaging with investee companies to reduce PAIs, screening the companies based on the best performers against each PAI, etc). In addition, 77% of respondents to the public consultation find it unclear when FMPs should consider that the PAIs are to be considered as material in the context of the product disclosures for DNSH 383 . The concept of \u2018good governance\u2019 is also noted not to be sufficiently defined, leaving room for interpreting the related requirements (e.g. exclusion policies and standards, setting due diligence processes and policies for the detection and remediation of potential violations, etc.). See section 3 of Annex 2 for further details and breakdowns per types of respondents and stakeholders.\n\nAnother aspect left to the discretion of managers relates to the way sustainable companies are counted in portfolios. Firms are free to choose whether they count the entirety of a sustainable company (beyond a certain level of revenue derived from sustainable activities), or whether they count only the proportion of revenue attributed to those activities 384 . Box 9 illustrates this point how FMPs are responsible for conducting their individual assessments for each investment and disclosing the underlying assumptions and methodologies they rely on. Depending on the method, considerable differences can be noted in the share of sustainable investment disclosed for a product, i.e. with the right-hand approach signalling a far higher proportion, yet based on a similar investment in an equivalent company.\n\n Box 9: Explanation of the two main approaches to calculating \u2018sustainable investment proportion\u2019, Morningstar 385 \u00a0\n\nThis contributes to the effect that the disclosures made under the SFDR often lack comparability. Different interpretations of the regulation have led FMPs to adopt different approaches when applying key SFDR concepts, especially the calculation of sustainable investment exposure (see box 10).\n\nAs a result, products with similar mandates and portfolios will report divergent exposures to sustainable investments depending on the methodology chosen. The lack of transparency regarding the approach taken and the underlying methodologies is making it impossible for end-investors to compare competing products. The discretion in reporting on PAIs also does not ensure comparability, while reporting on products\u2019 Taxonomy-alignment is limited and only gives a partial account of their overall footprint.\n\nBox 10\u00a0below illustrates the wide range of numbers that investors are facing. It builds on an analysis conducted by Morningstar 386 looking at the differences in the reported sustainable investment exposure between 11 global large-cap ETFs that track a Paris-aligned benchmark and have similar portfolios.\n\nBox 10: minimum % of sustainable investments for 11 funds tracking large-cap Paris-Aligned Benchmarks 387 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nOther concepts which are considered to be unclear include the term \u2018promotion of ESG characteristics\u2019 (on which the Article 8 disclosures are based), which is very broad and lacks minimum conditions 388 , and specific indicators such as the ones linked to the violations of UN Guiding Principles (UNGP) and the OECD Multinational Enterprises (OECD MNEs) (where FMPs note that they lack the clarity needed on what is a relevant divestment signal) 389 .\n\nIn addition, some of the interactions between the different SFDR requirements and concepts also are considered to lack clarity.\u00a0This is particularly the case in the way the entity-level disclosures obligations and the product level disclosures should interact. 61% of FMPs 390 who responded to the public consultation flagged that the legal implications of disclosing PAI indicators at the product level on the related disclosure obligations at the entity level is not clear (i.e. whether disclosing certain indicators at product level triggers a legal obligation to disclose at the level of entity). 66% of FMPs and financial advisers 391 who responded to the public consultation also flagged that the interactions between the product level disclosure requirements under Article 7 and the ones under the Article 8 are not clear. As a result, it is not clear which obligations apply at which stage of the product disclosures 392 .\n\n\u00d8\nDisclosures are seen as very lengthy and to rely on complex, unintuitive and technical terms regarding FMPs\u2019 consideration of sustainability risks at both entity and product level\n\nThe SFDR aims to enhance transparency on ESG characteristics of financial products and ESG processes implemented by FMPs through its entity and product level disclosures. However, several limitations are seen to undermine their usefulness in fighting greenwashing and providing relevant information to end-investors.\n\nFMPs need to gather and report a significant amount of data both at the entity level and the product levels. At the entity level, FMPs need to provide information on their integration of sustainability risks into their investment decision-making processes and remuneration policies, and on how they consider the principal adverse impacts of their investment decisions on sustainability factors (requirement for large firms, small firms follow a comply or explain approach). However, there is considerable evidence that much of this information is not really used by investors, therefore reducing its effectiveness and efficiency in achieving the objectives of the framework 393 . At the level of their investment products, FMPs need to disclose whether and how they consider sustainability risks as well as additional ESG disclosures for products promoting environmental or social characteristics (Article 8) and for products pursing a sustainable objective (Article 9). The length of the disclosure requirements was compounded by some regulatory duplication of transparency obligations, notably between the SFDR and the CSRD. Based on the current scope of the CSRD, some FMPs are facing duplicative entity level disclosure requirements, i.e. having to report on their principal adverse impact indicators under the SFDR and to disclose sustainability information according to the European sustainability reporting standards (ESRS) under the CSRD, which can both refer to the same information, but using different terminology 394 .\n\nThe legal concepts used in investors-facing disclosures are also seen as too complex\u00a0and not retail friendly 395 . The references to terms such as \u2018sustainable investment objective\u2019, \u2018environmental or social characteristics\u2019, \u2018principal adverse impacts\u2019, \u2018taxonomy-aligned investment\u2019, and \u2018do no significant harm\u2019 are argued by many to demand an excessively high level of familiarity with environmental and social metrics, performance data and the regulatory framework 396 . Further, the SFDR disclosures are, given their different locations (pre-contractual documents, periodic reports, websites), challenging to navigate 397 .\n\n\u00d8\nDisclosures are considered to lack comparability and to fail in providing transparency on the methodology used\n\nAs noted above,\u00a0there is no uniform methodology to date for calculating the proportion of sustainable investment of a product, or for taking into consideration principal adverse impact. This allows for a variety of methodologies.\n\nGiving FMPs a certain level of flexibility is necessary to allow the market to implement a wide variety of ESG strategies and innovate in their approach to sustainability. However, such flexibility must be accompanied by transparency on the approach and underlying methodology to inform end-investors.\n\nHowever, current product disclosures are regarded as failing to offer sufficient transparency on proprietary methods or even to evaluate the effectiveness of products\u2019 performance against the sustainability characteristics or objectives established. In particular, there is little transparency on how the DNSH principle is applied. Box 8 below provides some example of product disclosures lacking sufficient transparency on methodology, impeding scrutiny and evaluation of the effectiveness of the sustainability-related approaches.\n\nBox 11: Examples of missing data on methodology from recent study 398\n\n-\nAmong 43 analysed products, 32 stated that they address the DNSH principle in their methodology. Out of these, 15 claim to assess the DNSH principle using PAIs. Only 6 products disclose that thresholds are applied to determine harm, but none disclosed specific thresholds for identifying harmful activities.\n\n-\nNo product provides transparent qualitative or quantitative criteria or threshold to define when an activity harms environmental or social objectives or targets high-risks activities.\n\n-\nSimilarly, 15 products claim to address good governance (12 being products disclosing under Article 8 and 3 under Article 9), but only 5 provide detailed processes or policies, usually referencing FMPs\u2019 responsible governance principles or international standards.\n\n-\nDedicated KPIs or targets are largely absent (mainly due to lack of clarity in disclosure requirements)\n\n-\nThe Platform for Sustainable Finance (PSF) also highlighted in its report 399 that most product disclosures lack information about tolerance levels (the tolerated level of exposures to the mandatory principal adverse impact indicators) set by FMPs.\n\n\u00d8\nLack of data compared to what is required by the SFDR and inadequate guidance on estimates\n\nThe mismatch in some of the datapoints expected under the SFDR and those provided under other parts of the EU framework is assessed under the question on coherence below. Besides this, FMPs notably lack granular data for investments in entities and assets that fall outside of the CSRD scope (a challenge set to increase with the changes pursuant to the omnibus). This is particularly the case for certain types of assets (e.g. infrastructure, sovereigns, certain private assets etc) and for international investments.\n\nDue to the lack of publicly available data from underlying investments, FMPs have to rely on additional sources to complement company reported data, mainly estimates generated either in-house or by third party providers.\n\nThe SFDR permits their use when the information needed is not readily available, but does not provide for any rules, guidance or minimum safeguards on how to generate such ESG estimates. The level 2 and 3 rules only provide for some transparency expectations. The ESAs clarified that it would be good practice for FMPs to disclose for each PAI indicator the proportion of investments for which data was obtained directly from investee companies and the proportion of investments for which data was obtained by carrying out additional research, cooperating with third party data providers or external experts or making reasonable assumptions 400 .\n\nHowever, no further guidance has been provided so far on how such estimates should be produced and whether they should follow minimum requirements. In addition, FMPs largely rely on non-EU third party providers for such estimates. These actors are not subject to any EU rules regarding the way they conduct their businesses, how they set their fees, on prevention on conflict of interest etc.\n\nFindings from Sustainalytics 401 (analysing approximately 12,000 issuers) confirm the lack of available data on principal adverse impacts (see box 12). The analysis shows that companies in the sample were largely able to report data for over half of the mandatory PAIs but no single issuer reported data across all. (see Graph 1).\u00a0Further, less than 10% of issuers have reported data on, for example, gender pay gap and emissions to water (see Graph 2).\n\nFirst reporting by companies in 2025 under the (pre-Omnibus) CSRD/ESRS signals some change but largely appears to confirm the trend. An analysis by EFRAG of the first reporting in 2025 for a sample of 656 companies notes that, while topics such as climate change mitigation and social topics such as business conduct and own workforce are considered material and reported on in accordance with ESRS by over 80-90% of companies, topics such as biodiversity and water are considered material and reported on by 30-40% of companies 402 .\n\nA recent Bloomberg study 403 (see box 13) describes the extent of the data gaps per types of entities and highlight the very low coverage for small companies. Also, while the coverage for large EU and large EU PIE 404 companies is currently estimated at 40%, this is set to be reduced in the future by the upcoming changes to the reporting landscape announced by the simplification omnibus. In addition, the lack of regulatory obligations for benchmark providers creates additional data challenges for FMPs relying on indices.\n\nAs a result, FMP struggle to collect, measure or quantify certain indicators, which are often sourced either internally or commercially from third party providers 405 . The over-reliance on the use of estimates, coupled with the lack of guidance on how to produce such estimates and the lack of regulatory framework on third-party providers of such estimates, results in additional operational, regulatory and reputational risk for managers. When asked about the cost of disclosures, 58% (167 out of 287) of total respondents answered that they do not consider it to be proportionate to the benefits generated. This figure increases to 71% (133 out of 186) among FMPs and financial advisers. FMPs and financial advisers indicated that the main components of the costs of disclosures are the costs of personnel and of external advisory services.\n\nBox 12: Availabilities of PAI-related information from investee companies (Sustainalytics 406 )\n\nGraph 1 \u2013 Number of companies covering the mandatory PAI indicators\n\n Graph 2 - Issuers\u2019 data for mandatory PAI reporting\n\nBox 13: SFDR mandatory environmental PAI coverage by type of company (against 16,000 companies)\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\n\u00d8\nObserved misuse of the framework as a labelling regime\n\nThe trend that the three sets of products\u2019 disclosures under the SFDR have been used as \u2018de facto\u2019 categories/labels has been widely observed: (i) Article 6 for all managed funds 407 ; (ii) Article 8 for products which promote environmental or social characteristics; and (iii) Article 9 for funds which have a sustainable investment objective 408 . These articles have been effectively used in the market in line with distribution and client appetite as if they were investor facing labels, yet with none of the criteria or procedural steps which normally underpin widely used and accepted categories and market labels (e.g. compliance with externally drawn up criteria, independent certification, validation by a third party etc.) 409 .\n\nThe responses to the public consultations confirmed this trend, with 83% of respondents (245 out of 296) agreed that the SFDR is currently not being used solely as a disclosure framework as intended but is also being used as a labelling and marketing tool.\n\nThis was partly due to implied differences in the ambition level of products where Article 8 and Article 9 products have been commonly referred to as \u2018light green\u2019 and \u2018dark green\u2019 products, respectively. Collectively, Article 8 and Article 9 constitute nearly 60% of the universe of EU funds in scope of the SFDR by assets, which have totalled around EUR6 trillion, and 50.1% by number of funds. 410 Another explanation for the misuse of the disclosure articles is the demand and market pressure to classify products into different sustainability-related categories 411 .\n\n3.1.2.\nCoherence\n\nIs the framework coherent with other parts of the sustainable finance framework? Are existing provisions coherent with each other?\n\nIn terms of coherence, the SFDR has introduced multiple layers of sustainability-related requirements that are considered complex to apply, including in tandem with other parts of the sustainable finance framework. The bulk of the complexities mainly comes from the three steps underlying the definition of \u2018sustainable investment\u2019 (as described at the beginning of section 3.1.1 above, i.e. contribution, DNSH and good governance) that need to be conducted as part of the sustainability assessment for funds disclosing under Article 9. Certain legal misalignments between these concepts and other obligations required from other pieces of the sustainable finance framework have been signalled as increasing the complexity of the SFDR implementation.\n\nThe SFDR and the other sustainable finance rules are closely interlinked and are intended to complement each other to form a coherent set of disclosures, criteria and investment tools. The frameworks were conceived to work well together to ensure that the different pieces and criteria provide legal certainty to users, including to help FMPs define their approach to sustainability and to ensure they have access to the necessary data from underlying investments to comply with their reporting obligations and conduct their sustainability assessments.\n\nHowever, despite the need to work well together, some unintended legal misalignments have led to some inconsistencies and mismatches in the definition of sustainability-related concepts and disclosures.\n\n\u00d8\nMisalignments between \u2018environmentally sustainable economic activities\u2019 under the EU Taxonomy and \u2018sustainable investment\u2019 under the SFDR\n\nThe coexistence between the SFDR definition of \u2018sustainable investment\u2019 and what constitutes an \u2018environmentally sustainable\u2019 activity under the EU Taxonomy is considered problematic due to the absence of a clear legal link between these two concepts and technical differences.\n\nThe SFDR definition is entirely based on disclosure requirements and offers flexibility to FMPs to calibrate their approach. It is designed to be broader than the approach of the EU Taxonomy, which establishes a robust and science-based classification system by providing a set of criteria to identify economic activities substantially contributing to the EU\u2019s six environmentally objectives. The Taxonomy was therefore meant to act as an efficient measuring tool for investors for certain types of assets while the sustainable investment definition was meant to enable FMPs to disclose other methodologies and approaches to define sustainability.\n\nThis has the effect that investments in Taxonomy aligned economic activity are not automatically deemed as sustainable investments under the SFDR. This is mainly due to technical differences between the DNSH test under the SFDR and the DNSH test under the Taxonomy Regulation 412 (e.g. a taxonomy-aligned investment could fail the DNSH test under the SFDR if it is not aligned with the approach taken by the FPMs regarding the consideration of social principal adverse impacts). This lack of clarity hindered the objective of the EU Taxonomy, i.e. setting a common language to define sustainability throughout the whole regulatory framework. It also further rendered more complex in the implementation of these concepts, especially in cases where FMPs are applying both concepts simultaneously.\n\nIn addition, the fact that different sustainability-related concepts and processes under the SFDR and the EU Taxonomy are using the same or similar terms has led to further confusion and complexities for investors (i.e. two different DNSH tests under the two pieces of regulation, two approaches to \u2018(substantial) contribution\u2019, \u2018minimum safeguards\u2019 under the Taxonomy vs \u2018good governance\u2019 under the SFDR) regarding what are, in fact, sustainable economic activities and investments 413 .\n\nDespite the clarification provided by the Commission in June 2023 regarding the assessment of Taxonomy-aligned investments under the SFDR framework 414 , many respondents to the public consultation suggested that more effort should be made to simplify the interactions between the SFDR and the Taxonomy 415 .\n\n\u00d8\nMisalignments between \u2018sustainable investment\u2019 under the SFDR and the Benchmarks Regulation\u00a0\n\nDespite the legal link between the SFDR and the EU climate benchmarks under SFDR Article 9(3), there are a few technical differences between the requirements for PAB and CTBs and the definition of \u2018sustainable investment\u2019 under the SFDR which have caused confusion among market participants regarding the status of passive financial products tracking a PAB/CTB under the SFDR and make their use more complex.\n\nOnly 7% of respondents (19 out of 261) of the public consultation agreed that the SFDR approach to DNSH and good governance are consistent with the ESG exclusions under the PAB and CTB, against 34% (88 out of 261) who totally or mostly disagreed\u00a0while the rest of the respondents \u2018partially disagreed and partially agreed\u2019 (24%, 62 out of 261) or indicated \u2018don\u2019t know/no opinion/not applicable\u2019 (35%, 92 out of 261). 416 . This refers to the few misalignments between the principal adverse impacts under the SFDR (as defined in the Annex 1 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288) and the exclusions under the EU Climate Benchmarks (as defined under the Article 12 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818).\n\nThese unintended misalignments between the two frameworks have been noted to hinder the objectives of the EU climate benchmarks within financial markets, i.e. to provide comfort and certainty to their users 417 . Moreover, the disclosures under the Benchmark Regulation for ESG benchmarks and the SFDR are not fully aligned. As a result, many stakeholders have referred to the difficulties that this entails for passive fund managers, who fully rely on the design of the benchmarks they track and therefore would benefit from benchmark-level disclosures to perform their own fund-level disclosures.\n\n\u00d8\nMismatch in data expected under the SFDR and provided under\u00a0other parts of the EU framework\u00a0\n\nFMPs and FAs are expected to report sustainability-related information of financial products based on information disclosed or communicated by the issuers of the underlying investments of the product. However, such data is often lacking (a challenge set to increase with the changes pursuant to the omnibus), with substantial data gaps in the information needed for FMPs to meet the reporting requirements outlined in the SFDR 418 .\n\nFor example, respondents to the consultation regarding whether the SFDR disclosures are consistent with the CSRD requirements, more respondents disagreed (47%, 134 out of 285) than agreed (15%, 42 out of 285) 419 . In their written responses, many FMPs and financial advisers welcomed the alignment between the PAI indicators of the SFDR and ESRS but referred to technical misalignment in the definitions and terminologies used.\n\nIn addition, the approach to materiality has created a gap between the reporting obligations between the two regimes. Under the CSRD, reporting entities are allowed not to report against certain sustainability indicators if deemed \u2018not material\u2019 in the entities\u2019 own materiality assessment. However, unlike investee companies, FMPs are required to consider all mandatory principal adverse impacts (PAIs) under the SFDR, regardless of whether these indicators are material to the FMPs\u2019 investments 420 .\n\nTo alleviate the data gap created with this difference in materiality approach, the European Commission published in November 2024 an FAQ 421 clarifying that where an investee undertaking sets out that an indicator is non-material under CSRD reporting, a fund manager can rely on this to determine that the investee undertaking is also not contributing to the corresponding PAI under SFDR. However, the issues linked to materiality continue to be flagged as an impediment for FMPs to access necessary data.\n\nFurther, FMPs often rely on sustainability indices to measure the sustainability performance of a specific portfolio. This is especially the case for ETFs and other index-tracking products. The Benchmark Regulation introduced ESG disclosures for all benchmarks with ESG factors, mandating administrators to disclose whether they integrate ESG in their benchmark design, and if so how. The Benchmark Regulation also requires administrators of EU Climate Benchmarks to regularly report against a set of ESG KPIs.\n\nHowever, the ESG information provided by benchmark administrators has not been sufficient for FMPs to comply with the information required from financial products by the SFDR, mainly due to a misalignment between the ESG KPIs required from benchmark administrators under the BMR and the ones required from FMPs under the SFDR. Only 9% of respondents (24 out of 260) totally or mostly agreed that the ESG information provided by benchmark administrators aligns sufficiently with the information required by the SFDR for products referencing these benchmarks, compared to 33% who totally or mostly disagreed (87 out of 260) 422 .\n\nEFAMA also argued that \u2018benchmark administrators lack any regulatory incentive to provide the data to support asset managers to meet their disclosure and product governance requirements without the potential for significantly increased costs and where managers have no direct agency over the consistency, validity or quality of such data\u2019 423 .\n\nThis issue is particularly impactful on the universe of SFDR products, as reliance on index providers is prevalent. For example, the Frank Bold\u2019s study 424 revealed that 26 of the 43 analysed products are using indices for portfolio construction or performance assessment (including 5 of the 6 products disclosures under Article 9). Notably, 22 products depend on a single provider, highlighting a monopolistic trend in the sector.\n\nFinally, the proposed omnibus 425 on sustainability reporting\u00a0foresees considerable changes to the landscape of sustainable finance rules. The omnibus proposed to reduce the scope of entities that will be reporting ESG information under the CSRD and the EU Taxonomy. Depending also on the uptake of the future voluntary sustainability-related information standard for those outside the CSRD scope, this is set to widen the existing ESG data gaps as fewer entities will provide FMPs with the necessary data for their reporting obligations under the SFDR.\n\n\u00d8\nThe SFDR rules are seen as not catering\u00a0sufficiently for certain ESG strategies and assets and to be out of step with more recent guidance\n\nThe underlying concepts of the definition of sustainable investment also does not adequately capture the concept of\u00a0transition finance or cater for transition finance strategies, hindering the possibility for financial products (especially the ones disclosing under Article 9) to focus sufficiently in investing in transitional assets 426 (e.g. decarbonisation objective or social transition). This is in part due to the DNSH test which can be seen at odds with the strategy of transition finance as it does not allow for the inclusion of assets that cannot be considered as sustainable at the time of the investment. Some technical misalignments between the sustainable investment definition and the underlying criteria of the EU Climate Transition Benchmark (defined under the Benchmark Regulation) further hindered the possibility to conduct and disclose transition-related investment strategies under the SFDR. The issue is linked more broadly to the absence of a clear definition of \u201ctransition finance\u201d in EU legislation 427 and the limited use of the EU Taxonomy for this purpose 428 .\n\nFinally, the current SFDR rules coexist with the ESMA guidelines on funds\u2019 names, which aimed to partially (they only apply to investment funds) fill the perceived SFDR regulatory gaps. These guidelines have recently introduced minimum criteria for funds using ESG terms in their names (on top of SFDR disclosures that also apply to these funds). The guidelines were largely an attempt to bring clarity for investors amid FMPs\u2019 myriad sustainability-linked claims through the introduction of minimum criteria. They constitute the latest regulatory guidance, after notably a prior reclassification of Article 9 funds in Q4 2022, having resulted in some relabelling and renaming of EU sustainable finance funds.\n\nThey became applicable in November 2024 for new funds. For funds existing before this date, there is a transition period extending until 21 May 2025. Funds using terms related to \u2018environmental\u2019, \u2018impact\u2019 (additional impact disclosures) and \u2018sustainable\u2019 must apply the exclusions in the EU Paris-aligned benchmark (PAB) implementing rules (among other things), and funds using terms related to \u2018transition\u2019 (additional transition disclosures) \u2018social\u2019 or \u2018governance\u2019 must apply the exclusions in the implementing rules for Climate transition benchmarks (CTB). For CTB, these exclusions concern companies involved in controversial weapons, tobacco, or in violation of defined social safeguards, while for PAB they also include those involved in fossil fuels above certain thresholds. Funds should also allocate at least 80% of investments to meeting the targeted ESG objectives.\n\n3.2.\nHow relevant is the SFDR?\n\nIs the SFDR still relevant? (in terms of evolving objectives and needs)? How relevant is it in light of market developments and given political priorities?\n\nThe overwhelming majority (89%) of consultation-respondents consider that the objective to strengthen transparency through sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector is still fully relevant with over 90% considering that a disclosure framework at EU level is more effective and efficient than measures at Member State level. While the consultation predates some of the latest policy realignments and geopolitical shifts, as well as the implementation of the ESMA guidelines for fund names, broad support for a common regime in this area continues to be demonstrated in all recent stakeholder engagement and outreach, outlined in Annex 1. The feedback signals support for both the broad objectives of the SFDR in contributing toward the greater consideration of sustainability in investment practices, and to this end, the added value of a common sustainability disclosure framework at EU level.\n\nThe Commission President\u2019s mission letter for Commissioner Albuquerque thus asks to facilitate implementation of the sustainable finance framework,\u00a0to scale up its impact and to \u2018promote the development and transparent categorisation of financial products and services with sustainability features\u2019 429 . The\u00a0revision of the SFDR has been planned in the Commission work programme for Q4 2025, to ensure an appropriate simplification of the rules, commensurate with the objectives of the Commission\u2019s proposals to simplify sustainability reporting for companies.\n\nAfter some initial pushback to the ESMA fund name guidelines 430 , anecdotal stakeholder feedback increasingly suggests that there is growing acceptance among FMPs for the changes which they have introduced. Nonetheless, the guidelines do not apply to all products under the scope of the SFDR, do not constitute strict legal requirements 431 , and govern only the use of ESG terms in fund names and leave SFDR-related requirements and disclosures intact.\n\nWithout effective EU-level action to remedy the shortcomings noted above, the challenges explained earlier would persist, and the necessary simplification to boost the effectiveness and efficiency of the single market for sustainable finance products would not be ensured. Conversely, a repeal of the SFDR would mean depriving financial market participants, distributors and investors of a common framework for sustainability-linked claims involving financial products, meaning the policy field would become unregulated again, contrary to the expressed preference of the large majority of stakeholders.\n\nFinally, in terms of coherence of the overall sustainable finance framework, without commensurate changes in other linked parts of the framework, repealing the SFDR would render some provisions in these other areas meaningless (e.g. links to SFDR-specific terms in sustainability preferences under MiFID/IDD). Without a defined use-case for financial products, the purpose of other parts of the sustainable finance framework, e.g. sustainability information required under CSRD and Taxonomy, would also be partially undermined. The Omnibus proposals also opted not to repeal the CSRD and Taxonomy, rather to pare back specific requirements.\n\n3.3.\nWhat is the EU added value of the SFDR?\n\nHas the SFDR been justified, and does it continue to be justified? What has been the value-added compared to national rules?\n\nNotwithstanding the shortcomings enumerated in section 3.1, the continued relevance of the principles and objectives of the SFDR are not in question, as assessed in section 3.2. However, there is a need to address the detailed shortcomings, which can only be done at EU level. While Member State level action could partially address some of the shortcomings (e.g. through national sustainable investment labels), the likely result would be further fragmentation of the single market, in a way which would not deliver a comprehensive, simplified, effective and efficient outcome for EU markets and investors, in line with the objectives of the regulation.\n\nConversely, remedying the shortcomings at EU level would ensure that they are addressed in a harmonised, effective, efficient and coherent manner across the single market, and in support of the broader strategic objectives of the Union, including consistency with the climate-neutrality objective of the climate law 432 . Requirements and disclosures could be simplified across the board, both for the benefit of FMPs and investors, in a harmonised way throughout the Union. Common solutions to transparency-related challenges regarding access to ESG datapoints could be designed in a way which facilitates the business of financial market participants in an even way across the EU and protects investors, and tackles information asymmetries, equally regardless of which Member State they are located in. This could in turn better serve the objective of mobilising funds toward the competitive opportunities in the green transition and other evolving strategic priorities in line with Union objectives, including contributing to empowering the greater participation of investors in EU capital markets, in line with the objectives of the Savings and Investments Union 433 .\n\n4.\nConclusions and lessons learned\n\nThe conclusion drawn from the above is that, despite some success in setting up a common framework for sustainability-related disclosures for investments, the SFDR falls short of realising its full potential in terms of effectiveness and efficiency in achieving the objectives set, and in terms of coherence with the rest of the sustainable finance framework. The anticipated benefits in terms of levelling information asymmetries, tackling greenwashing and helping to boost investment toward more sustainable economic practices have not been fully met, given undue complexity, uncertainty and excessive costs.\n\nThe underlying reasons why this has turned out to be the case, for a framework which has only applied in full for a few years, can be summarised as follows. First, the SFDR began to apply in March 2021, before its detailed Level 2 implementing rules which specified its novel concepts were finalised and began to apply in 2023. Thus, financial market participants had to apply the new regime under considerable initial uncertainty in the first phase and make adjustments once the Level 2 rules entered into force 434 . Challenges linked to the unclarity and complexity of several concepts and requirements emerged from the outset 435 ,\u00a0together with some misalignments with the rest of the sustainable finance framework.\n\nSecond, the lack of clarity and complexity of the concepts and requirements has necessitated successive additional pieces of guidance, provided by the Commission and European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), in response to numerous interpretation and implementation questions raised by market actors. These have not always been sufficient to help overcome the underlying complexity and to facilitate implementation for FMPs, and have entailed further adjustments in the composition, naming and disclosures of various financial products, adding to the perceived implementation burden.\n\nThird, data gaps also became apparent in terms of the requirements of the SFDR on the one hand, and scarce available market data on the other. Given that the SFDR entered into application before other key pieces of the EU sustainable finance framework, namely detailed sustainability disclosures from companies under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive/European Sustainability Reporting Standards and the EU Taxonomy, which were intended to increasingly inform product disclosures under the SFDR, a data challenge for products to be able to demonstrate their sustainability credentials was present from the beginning 436 . That said, comprehensive, reliable and comparable sustainability information from investees was never going to be delivered fully (and cheaply) through these disclosures alone, even before the changes under the Omnibus proposals. For one, a large part of the investments by financial products is made in companies not subject to these rules (e.g. non-EU companies or other assets outside the scope of the EU rules).\n\nFinally, throughout the early implementation phase, it became evident that most of the concepts for the new disclosures for investors, in particular retail investors, were not easily understandable or readily usable by them. Thus Article 8 and 9 became used as a way to convey a high-level message of products\u2019 key features, but without the technical elements designed for this purpose. Considerable evidence also emerged from the consultations that the vast majority of end-investors would be better served by shorter and more focused information than the lengthy SFDR disclosures.\n\nConsequently, the following problem drivers are key starting points for the SFDR review to tackle:\n\n1.\nSustainability-related concepts and disclosure requirements which are unclear, complex, and difficult to implement, and which necessitate disclosures which are lengthy and difficult to compare for investors.\n\n2.\nMisalignment and duplication between specific concepts and requirements in the SFDR and other EU sustainable finance legislation.\n\n3.\nData gaps in available ESG data, lack of harmonised guidance for the use of estimates.\n\n4.\nUnintended use of the SFDR\u2019s disclosure categories as de facto labels, but without common criteria or other requirements fit for this purpose.\n\nThe lessons learned for the review of the SFDR from the problem drivers and their root causes can be summarised as the need to (i) ensure a coherent implementation timeline for the future changes, (ii) introduce clearer, simpler and more proportionate rules and concepts for FMPs\u2019 and investors\u2019 benefit, (iii) explore the case for formalising and embedding these in a framework of product categories, in accordance with the revealed preference of markets to cluster products in this way, and (iv) ensure that the revised concepts, rules and possible categories rely on ESG data that is available and/or possible to reliably estimate.\n\nAnnex 12: SME check\n\nOverview of impacts on SMEs\n\nRelevance for SMEs\n\n\n\n\nThe initiative is directly relevant for FMPs which are SMEs, but less so for SMEs as investees.\n\n(1) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Identification of affected businesses and assessment of relevance\n\n\n\n\nAre SMEs directly affected?\u00a0In which sectors?\n\n\n\n\nYes, namely in the financial sector\n\n\n\n\nEstimated number of directly affected SMEs\n\n\n\n\nThe vast majority of FMPs are SMEs, which can e.g. be concluded from the number of entities disclosing on a mandatory basis because of exceeding an employee threshold of 500 that was estimated based on a sample by ESMA to at least 400 FMPs, whereas in the same sample about 3400 FMPs were not subject to mandatory disclosures (i.e. <500 employees). 437\n\n\n\n\nEstimated number of employees in directly affected SMEs\n\n\n\n\nNot available.\n\n\n\n\nAre SMEs indirectly affected? In which sectors? What is the estimated number of indirectly affected SMEs and employees?\n\n\n\n\nSMEs as investees can, together with the safeguards of the omnibus (as explained in the competitiveness check, Annex 5), benefit from the flow of funds and be included in products under a simple categorisation system, as well as from lower reporting and compliance costs incumbent on FMPs.\n\n(2)\nConsultation of SME stakeholders\n\n\n\n\nHow has the input from the SME community been taken into consideration?\n\n\n\n\nThe public consultation asked whether respondents were SMEs, which was the case for 128 out of 324 replies.\n\n\n\n\nAre SMEs\u2019 views different from those of large businesses?\n\n\n\n\nNo, in the sense that SMEs as well as large companies pointed out that the costs are significant for them. One stakeholder pointed out that smaller firms may not have the resources, in particular financial, to accommodate the increasing reporting demands, which can put them at risk and at a great disadvantage compared to larger firms.\n\n(3)\nAssessment of impacts on SMEs\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the estimated direct costs for SMEs of the preferred policy option?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nQualitative assessment\n\n\n\n\nFMPs which are SMEs are expected to be the main beneficiaries of the overall cost savings detailed in Annex 3.\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative assessment\n\n\n\n\nIn Annex 3, we summarise our estimations of the one-off and recurring costs for businesses in the baseline scenario, decomposed to large and SME in the baseline scenario as well as the changes for the preferred combination of policy options. For the removal of entity level disclosures, we do not expect additional costs and for the simplification of product level disclosures we expect limited implementation costs as the one-off costs have been incurred in the past and the proposed simplified structure will remove burdensome disclosures. The costs for the product categorisation system are also expected to be limited as it builds to a maximum extent on existing structures such as the minimum safeguards from the ESMA guidelines on funds names that have already been implemented.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the estimated direct benefits/cost savings for SMEs of the preferred policy option?\n\n\n\n\nQualitative assessment\n\n\n\n\nFMPs which are SMEs are expected to be the main beneficiaries of the overall cost savings detailed in Annex 3.\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative assessment\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, we estimate SME to incur about EUR 163 million of annual recurring costs, of which about EUR 43 million are for entity-level disclosures and EUR 120 million for product level disclosures. While the reduction of entity-level costs in the preferred combination of options is certain with only minimal one-off costs, and we estimate that more than 50% of product-level costs can be saved thanks to the significant reduction of product-level disclosures, we were not able to collect sufficient evidence for the one-off impacts of the introduction of a product categorisation system.\n\nIn addition, SMEs would benefit more than proportionally from simplification as we can observe pronounced cost digression effects, i.e. in relative terms SMEs incur much higher costs relative to their AUM than larger firms due to certain minimum efforts that are necessary to build and maintain sustainability related disclosures.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the indirect impacts of this initiative on SMEs?\n\n\n\n\nSMEs as investees can benefit from the flow of funds and be included in products under a simple categorisation system, as well as from lower reporting and compliance costs incumbent on FMPs.\n\n(4)\nMinimising negative impacts on SMEs\n\n\n\n\nAre SMEs disproportionately affected compared to large companies?\n\nIf yes, are there any specific subgroups\u00a0of SMEs more exposed than others?\n\n\n\n\nYes, notably FMPs which are SMEs, see section 3 above.\n\n\n\n\nHave mitigating measures been included in the preferred option/proposal? \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\nContribution to the 35% burden reduction target for SMEs\n\n\n\n\nAre there any administrative cost savings relevant for the 35% burden reduction target for SMEs?\n\n\n\n\nThe reduced administrative requirements linked to the removal of entity-level disclosures (option 1.2) would eliminate burdens estimated to account for 25% of the costs under the current rules, largely incumbent on FMPs which are SMEs. In addition, the simplification of product-level disclosures (option 2.2) and introduction of product categories (option 3.1) in line with market practices, which overall are estimated to allow cost savings as outlined in Annex 3, are estimated to facilitate further overall burden reduction for SMEs toward the 35% target.\n\n(1)\n\n\u00a0 Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on sustainability\u2010related disclosures in the financial services sector.\n\n(2)\n\nThese ambitions were laid out in the Communications on the European Green Deal (COM(2019) 640 final) and on A Strong Social Europe for Just Transition (COM(2020) 14 final).\n\n(3)\n\n\u00a0 Strategic Foresight Report 2023 See also the impact assessment accompanying the 2040 climate target Communication\n\n(4)\n\n\u00a0 Savings and investments union - European Commission\n\n(5)\n\n\u00a0 Overview of sustainable finance - European Commission\n\n(6)\n\n\u00a0 Platform on Sustainable Finance - European Commission\n\n(7)\n\n\u00a0 Categorisation of products under the SFDR: Proposal of the Platform on Sustainable Finance According to Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, cumulative flows into ESG equity funds have been 2.7 times higher compared to non-ESG counterparts from 2019 to 2023.

While Q1 2025 saw the first net outflows from EU sustainable funds, these represented only 0.04% of total fund assets. Equity funds continue to dominate the sector, but with recent growth into sustainable bond funds as the green bond market continues to expand. In terms of performance, sustainable funds lost 0.7% of their value in Q1 2025, faring better than the wider market (1.4% decline for the Morningstar Global Market index).

Two public consultations (targeted and open) ensued, running from September to December 2023. The European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) published a joint opinion on the assessment of the SFDR in June 2024, addressing recommendations to the Commission. The Platform for Sustainable Finance provided two opinions in December 2023 and December 2024 on key issues to address and recommending setting up categories for financial products. Full details are provided in Annex II.\n\n(12)\n\n\u00a0This includes calls expressed by Member States e.g. in the 11 March 2024 Statement of the Eurogroup on the future of the capital markets union to improve usability, enhance clarity and reduce burdens in the EU sustainable finance framework, as well as the July 2024 study prepared for the ECON committee of the European Parliament.\n\n(13)\n\n\u00a0 ac06a896-2645-4857-9958-467d2ce6f221_en\n\n(14)\n\n\u00a0 Commission work programme 2025 - European Commission\n\n(15)\n\n\u00a0 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288\n\n(16)\n\n\u00a0 ESMA34-1592494965-657 Guidelines on funds names using ESG or sustainability related terms .

In the consultation, while many FMPs and financial advisers welcomed the alignment between the PAI indicators of the SFDR and ESRS, when asked if the SFDR disclosures are consistent with the CSRD requirements, more respondents disagreed (47%, 134 out of 285) than agreed (15%, 42 out of 285).

They constitute the latest regulatory guidance, after notably a prior reclassification of Art. 9 funds in Q4 2022, having resulted in some relabelling and renaming of EU sustainable finance funds.\n\n(71)\n\nNamely, changes introduced by Directive (EU) 2024/825 amending Directives 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU as regards empowering consumers for the green transition through better protection against unfair practices and through better information (see also Annex 6, section 3).\n\n(72)\n\nEFAMA, Market Insights, April 2025\n\n(73)\n\nAt the time of writing (until Q4 2025),\u00a0while aspects of the Commission\u2019s proposals on the Omnibus had been adopted (namely the \u2018 stop-the-clock \u2019 amendments to delay phasing-in the application of the CSRD and CSDDD for a range of entities), the remaining negotiations on the Omnibus between the co-legislators were still underway, but looked set to confirm the Commission\u2019s proposal for simplifications of the current framework, and even to\u00a0go beyond in certain respects (see namely Council of the EU, Draft directive on certain corporate sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements, Council\u2019s negotiating mandate , June 2025, which puts forth a revenue threshold of EUR 450mn to descope more companies). While not yet fully finalised and agreed, it was thus assumed highly unlikely that co-legislators would reverse course toward a pre-Omnibus scenario.\n\n(74)\n\nDated 25 July 2024, the consolidated Q&As on the SFDR exceed 70 pages JC 2023 18 - Consolidated JC SFDR QAs\n\n(75)\n\nThe current ESRS includes over 50 datapoints to support the corresponding information provisions of financial market participants related to principal adverse impacts set out in the SFDR Level 2 (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288)\n\n(76)\n\nNamely, changes introduced by Directive (EU) 2024/825 amending Directives 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU as regards empowering consumers for the green transition through better protection against unfair practices and through better information (see also Annex 6, section 3).\n\n(77)\n\nPAI disclosures as per Article 4 constitute the bulk of entity-level disclosure requirements detailed in the Level 2 regulation and a major factor in the problems identified in section 2, whereas there are no further Level 2 specifications concerning Articles 3 and 5.\n\n(78)\n\n\u00a0Of which\u00a071% are banks, 20% insurance companies, 8% are asset management firms and the rest pension funds and investment firms.

Data from ESAs report on PAI disclosures 2024 .\n\n(80)\n\nWhile aggregated numbers on what this means in terms of the adverse impacts of investments by covered entities\u00a0are not available, the ESAs provided information on their average adverse impact on key indicators: 26.59m tons for total GHG emissions (highest 540m), 18 000 tons for average GHG intensity of investee companies, and 7000 tons for carbon footprint.\n\n(81)\n\n\u00a0A comprehensive EU consumer testing exercise should be conducted to ensure the indicators that are to be retained can be understood and are deemed important by end-investors.\n\n(82)\n\nData from past disclosures by FMPs should be used to determine which KPIs are currently being disclosed, which can inform on their level of usability and ease of production. For example, the ESAs annual report on PAI disclosures under the SFDR shows that the KPI on total GHG emissions is being widely disclosed across FMPs.\n\n(83)\n\nTo reduce the data gaps and bring coherence between the disclosures from non-financial companies and financial companies.\n\n(84)\n\nFor example, the PSF acknowledges that certain indicators are only material for companies involved in specific economic activities, such as PAI 9 (hazardous and radioactive waste ratio), PAI 5 (non-renewable energy consumption and production, specifically for energy production), and PAI 8 (emissions to water), and might not be material and comparable across all companies\n\n(85)\n\nThe information needed might also be available under the annual joint ESAs reports on disclosures of principal adverse impacts under the SFDR. See here the 2024 version for a state of play of the reporting based on FY 2023. If the information available in these reports are not enough, a market study should be conducted to take stock of disclosures made under Article 4 SFDR.\n\n(86)\n\nTogether with the provisions of Chapter Ib of Directive 2007/36/EC (shareholder rights), as amended\n\n(87)\n\nOmnibus proposal COM (2025)81 final; Commission presents voluntary sustainability reporting standard to ease burden on SMEs - European Commission\n\n(88)\n\n\u00a0For example, the Morgan Stanley study (2024) finds that 85% individual investors are interested in sustainable investing and the Schroders Study (2019) shows that the interest for sustainable investing has grown for 77% of respondents between 2015 and 2019.\n\n(89)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Retail Financial Services and Products - October 2022 - - Eurobarometer survey\n\n(90)\n\nSuch as the sustainable investment objective and the proportion of sustainable investment, the environmental and/or social characteristics, the investments in Taxonomy-aligned economic activities, the do no significant harm test, the consideration of principal adverse impacts on sustainability factors, the asset allocation, the use of derivatives in attaining the ESG characteristics/objectives, the use of a specific index as reference benchmark\n\n(91)\n\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288, reporting templates from Annex II to V.\n\n(92)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Data from past disclosures by FMPs should be used to determine which KPIs are currently being disclosed, which can inform on their level of usability and ease of production. For example, the ESAs\u2019 annual report on PAI disclosures under the SFDR shows that the KPI on total GHG emissions is being widely disclosed across FMPs.\n\n(93)\n\nFor example, the PSF report already highlights which sustainability indicators lack publicly available or estimated data, such as biodiversity and water. The ESAs annual report mentioned above also gives a useful state of play of the reporting based on FY 2023. In addition, box 12 of annex 11 shows that ESG data is widely available on topics such as GHG emissions, exposure to fossil fuel sectors and exposure to controversial weapons. If the information available in these reports are not enough, a market study should be conducted to take stock of disclosures made under Article 4 SFDR.\n\n(94)\n\nSee Annex 2, Section 3, sub-section 3 \u2018Categorisation for financial products\u2019.

The names of the categories will need to ensure coherence with other EU related measures and avoid replicating existing terms if the meaning is different.\n\n(108)\n\nFor reference, ESMA guidelines refer to 80%, while the UK FCA labelling rules refer to 70%.\n\n(109)\n\n\u2018Specific considerations for the formulation of policy options arising from the Omnibus proposals, the ESMA fund names guidelines and the principle of proportionality\u2019\n\n(110)\n\n\u00a0Omnibus proposal COM (2025)81 final; Commission presents voluntary sustainability reporting standard to ease burden on SMEs - European Commission\n\n(111)\n\nThere are currently 4,220 open-ended funds and exchange-traded funds with ESG-or sustainability related terms in their names, i.e. in scope of the ESMA guidelines.

These indicators would be voluntary and aim at supporting FMPs in the implementation and boosting comparability. However, FMPs would be free to use other indicators if the ones provided in the level 2 rules do not fit their objectives, assets or strategies (e.g. impact strategies which call for more specific and targeted KPIs).\n\n(115)\n\nThe ESMA guidelines require funds to exclude certain companies referred to in the EU climate benchmark exclusions.\n\n(116)\n\nCompanies involved in (1) any activities related to controversial weapons; (2) the cultivation and production of tobacco; (3) in violation of the UN Global Compact (UN GC) principles or the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises; (4) companies that derive 1 % or more of their revenues from exploration, mining, extraction, distribution or refining of hard coal and lignite; (5) 10 % or more of their revenues from the exploration, extraction, distribution or refining of oil fuels; (6) 50 % or more of their revenues from the exploration, extraction, manufacturing or distribution of gaseous fuels; (7) 50 % or more of their revenues from electricity generation with a GHG intensity of more than 100 g CO2 e/kWh. In addition, the exclusion would specify that investees could not be engaged in activities involving fossil fuel expansion.\n\n(117)\n\nCompanies involved in (1) any activities related to controversial weapons; (2) the cultivation and production of tobacco; (3) in violation of the UN Global Compact (UN GC) principles or the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. In addition, the exclusion would specify that investees could not be engaged in activities involving fossil fuel expansion.\n\n(118)\n\nIn accordance with Article 1(2) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 over a period of maximum 5 (exceptionally 10) years, in other words where investee companies have related CapEx plans.\u00a0\n\n(119)\n\nBased on the concept proposed and to be developed under the Omnibus \u2013 namely new provisions in Articles 19a(5) and 29aa(5) of Directive 2013/34/EU\n\n(120)\n\nAs well as the details mentioned above under \u2018Elements to be defined at level 1 vs elements to be defined at level 2\u2019 on e.g. how the contribution of various assets/investees is calculated for meeting the positive criteria, rules for indicators\u2019 coverage of portfolios, and any permitted deviations from the exclusions at portfolio level e.g. for hedging.\n\n(121)\n\nStudies include Frank Bold, SFDR review\u00a0: analysis of current practices and future directions for investors , December 2024, and Morningstar: SFDR_Article_8_and_Article_9_Funds_Q4_2022.pdf\n\n(122)\n\nSee section 1.4 Annex 8. EU Platform on Sustainable Finance, Data Vendor Survey 2024 , March 2025. The survey concluded that\u00a0high levels of consistency were found in the estimations of exclusion across vendors, with 80% of issuers showing 0% divergence in their estimations of PAB exclusions\n\n(123)\n\nFor example, the different approaches to contribution described in Frank Bold, SFDR review\u00a0: analysis of current practices and future directions for investors , December 2024\n\n(124)\n\nE.g. to illustrate the point, limiting ESG products to those for which granular publicly available data is available under the (post-omnibus) CSRD, would represent a considerable change and challenge for FMPs in terms of administrative requirements and continuity (vs. specific objective 1), give investors a very narrow ESG product range for any meaningful comparison to serve their demonstrated interest in ESG investing (vs. specific objective 2; Annexes 2 and 10), and would rather diminish the scope of the EU single market for sustainable finance rather than boost its integrity (vs. general objective 1) and potential to efficiently allocate capital for Europe\u2019s competitiveness and sustainable prosperity (vs. general objective 2).\n\n(125)\n\nBetween 30% and 50% of the average holdings of EU asset managers consist of entities not subject to CSRD reporting requirements (and therefore do not publish Taxonomy or CSRD sustainability data). As a result, FMPs are already forced to source the missing data either internally or commercially from third-party providers. See ESMA report on Trends, Risks and Vulnerabilities (TRV), 2023\n\n(126)\n\nSee box 12, Annex 11\n\n(127)\n\nSee Annex 8, section 3\n\n(128)\n\nFor example, the PSF report already highlights which sustainability indicators lack publicly available or estimated data, such as biodiversity and water. The ESAs annual report mentioned above also gives a useful state of play of the reporting based on FY 2023. In addition, box 12 of annex 11 shows that ESG data is widely available on topics such as GHG emissions, exposure to fossil fuel sectors and exposure to controversial weapons. An analysis by EFRAG of the first reporting in 2025 under CSRD/ESRS for a sample of 656 companies also confirms that, while topics such as climate change mitigation and social topics such as business conduct and own workforce are considered material and reported on by over 80-90% of companies, topics such as biodiversity and water are considered material and reported on by 30-40% of companies.

This is anecdotally also confirmed by the experience of the UK in testing their voluntary labelling system for funds (see Annex 6 section C), where investors were found to prefer a limited number of clear and discrete labels that convey the main sustainability outcomes of a fund rather than more extensive categorisations based e.g. on complex gradations or ratings based on numerical systems, or reliance on unintuitive concepts.\n\n(134)\n\nThis option is recapped in the comparative tables below under sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 against the options to adjust entity and product level disclosures in the current framework, which is what would be repealed by this option. It is not repeated in the comparative table in section 6.3 against the options for product categories, which are not part of the current framework, and a comparison against which would therefore be less meaningful and informative.\n\n(135)\n\nThe obligations in the ESMA fund name guidelines are relevant to all fund documentation and marketing communications addressed to investors or potential investors for UCITS and AIFs, including when they are set up as EuVECAs, EuSEFs, ELTIFs and MMF.\n\n(136)\n\nNamely, changes introduced by Directive (EU) 2024/825 amending Directives 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU as regards empowering consumers for the green transition through better protection against unfair practices and through better information (see also Annex 6, section 3).\n\n(137)\n\n\u00a0 Commission Notice \u2013 Guidance on the interpretation and application of Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market\n\n(138)\n\nNegotiations on the proposed Green Claims Directive, still underway in Q4 2025, would likewise defer to EU financial services rules including in the areas governed by the SFDR and not apply additional requirements to mandatory or voluntary sustainability information required thereunder.\n\n(139)\n\nTechnically, as the ESMA guidelines also hinge on some SFDR concepts and templates for their effect (definition of \u201csustainable investment\u201d, disclosures of compliance with the guidelines to be done in SFDR level 2 templates), these elements in the guidelines would also be rendered moot/weakened by a repeal.\n\n(140)\n\nSee Section 3.2 of Annex 11\n\n(141)\n\nFinancial market participants are required to \u201cmake every effort to comply\u201d with the guidelines as per Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 establishing ESMA.

The ESAs annual report mentioned above also gives a useful state of play of the reporting based on FY 2023. In addition, box 12 of annex 11 shows that ESG data is widely available on topics such as GHG emissions, exposure to fossil fuel sectors and exposure to controversial weapons.\n\n(270)\n\nFor example, for the transition category, in 2024, 37% of polled investors in a Robeco study (300 FMPs) said they already invest in companies with high emissions if they have credible transition plans, and an extra 26% are planning to do so in following 1-2 years. Similar figures are reflected in a 2024 Morgan Stanley survey showing that globally, of the asset owners and asset managers surveyed that have a net-zero target, 32% and 25% respectively are expecting to meet their target by mostly shifting capital toward high emitters that are decarbonising and a further 28% of both groups is expecting to do so by a combination of this and tilting toward low emitters. Lastly, a 2025 survey commissioned by E3G in the UK found that 86% of investors surveyed consider transition plans as a valuable tool to inform their investment decisions.\n\n(271)\n\nFor example, the different approaches to contribution described in Frank Bold, SFDR review\u00a0: analysis of current practices and future directions for investors , December 2024\n\n(272)\n\nE.g. to illustrate the point, limiting ESG products to those for which granular publicly available data is available under the (post-omnibus) CSRD, would represent a considerable change and challenge for FMPs in terms of administrative requirements and continuity (vs. specific objective 1), give investors a very narrow ESG product range for any meaningful comparison to serve their demonstrated interest in ESG investing (vs. specific objective 2; Annexes 2 and 10), and would rather diminish the scope of the EU single market for sustainable finance rather than boost its integrity (vs. general objective 1) and potential to efficiently allocate capital for Europe\u2019s competitiveness and sustainable prosperity (vs. general objective 2).\n\n(273)\n\nThe SFDR level 2 could also provide a non-exhaustive list of ESG indicators on certain sustainability topics for FMPs\u2019 use (see further under section 1.2 below)\n\n(274)\n\nThese topics are set by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288, through the principal adverse impacts (PAIs) listed in table 1 of Annex I: GHG emissions, carbon footprint, GHG intensity, exposure to the fossil fuel sector, non-renewable energy consumption and production, energy consumption intensity, biodiversity, water, waste, human right due diligence processes, gender pay gap, gender diversity and controversial weapons.\n\n(275)\n\nThe ESMA guidelines require funds to exclude certain companies referred to in the EU climate benchmark exclusions.\n\n(276)\n\nThese topics are set by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288, through the principal adverse impacts (PAIs) listed in table 1 of Annex I: GHG emissions, carbon footprint, GHG intensity, exposure to the fossil fuel sector, non-renewable energy consumption and production, energy consumption intensity, biodiversity, water, waste, human right due diligence processes, gender pay gap, gender diversity and controversial weapons.\n\n(277)\n\nFurther analysis to be done ahead of the adoption of the level 2 measures. ESMA guidelines refer to 80%, the FCA labelling rules refer to 70%.\n\n(278)\n\nThis list would build on the current principal adverse indicators of the annex 1 of the SFDR Delegated Act and would take into account EU corporate reporting rules, market practices and available data.\n\n(279)\n\nCSRD public reporting in place since 2025; Taxonomy public reporting since 2022\n\n(280)\n\nE.g. the Global Reporting Initiative - GRI - Home\n\n(281)\n\nE.g. those published by a network of NGOs, namely GCEL 2024 | Global Coal Exit List ; \u00a0 Global Oil and Gas Exit List \u00a0\n\n(282)\n\n\u00a0EFRAG\u2019s 2025 State of Play study highlighted the 55% of ESRS preparers have already reported on transition plans. Furthermore, the Platform on Sustainable Finance\u2019s report on monitoring of capital flows demonstrates that it is possible to implement criteria for credible transition plans. They analysed 1063 companies operating within the European Economic Area, with 764 of them reporting under the NFRD and covering approximately 40% of NFRD universe. 12% of companies in scope fulfilled the minimum characteristics with elements of credible transition plans as defined by the PSF in its report on transition plans.\n\n(283)\n\nAs of August 2024, more than 6,000 companies have defined science-based pathways validated by the Science based target initiative (SBTi). The Recommendation on voluntary sustainability reporting for small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) adopted by the Commission in July 2025 also provides a basis for assessing transition (see C3 \u2013 GHG reduction targets and climate transition).\n\n(284)\n\n\u00a0 250730-recommendation-vsme-annex-1_en.pdf \u00a0\n\n(285)\n\nE.g.

Such reporting on partial alignment would provide more flexibility and foster a gradual environmental transition of activities over time, in line with the aim to scale up transition finance.

The SFDR was adopted on 27 November 2019 and has been in application since March 2021. It represents one of the first pieces of the EU Sustainable Finance framework and is part of a broader package of sustainability disclosure rules, tools and standards for non-financial and financial companies adopted pursuant to the Commission\u2019s 2018 Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth[2](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote3).\n\nThe SFDR is a disclosure framework which sets detailed sustainability disclosures for financial intermediaries and financial products regarding how they consider various environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. Its objective is to increase transparency, combat greenwashing and protect investors by ensuring that information in this respect is disclosed to investors by financial market participants such as asset managers and pension providers, and by financial advisers. More broadly, the SFDR thus contributes to the aims of: (i) helping to attract private funding to facilitate the transition towards greater sustainability; and (ii) helping European companies to seize competitive opportunities in this area.\n\nThe SFDR is complemented by a Commission Delegated Regulation[3](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote4) which lays down detailed disclosure rules for how financial market participants and financial advisers should disclose sustainability information towards investors about their investment activities and their financial products in order to help the latter make informed choices. The Delegated Regulation specifies notably the details of the information to be disclosed to investors in pre-contractual documents, on websites and in periodic reports both for financial market participants as entities and for the financial products which they make available.\n\nFor entity-level disclosures, financial market participants and financial advisers are required to explain how they integrate ESG considerations into their internal procedures, including their due diligence processes and consideration of responsible business practices. For product-level disclosures, including for investment funds, insurance-based investment products and pension products, they are required to disclose sustainability characteristics and objectives. Article 8 of the SFDR establishes that, for products that promote environmental or social characteristics, financial market participants must show how they promote such environmental and social characteristics. Article 9 of the SFDR establishes that, for products that have a sustainable investment as their objective, financial market participants must explain the sustainability objective and show how the objective is attained. Finally, all products in the scope of the SFDR are subject to the disclosures under Article 6 of the SFDR, according to which financial market participants must disclose how sustainability risks are integrated in the investment decision process when relevant, as well as the results of the assessment of the likely impacts of sustainability risks on the returns of the products.\n\nSince its inception, the SFDR has had broad-reaching effects on the market, accompanying a stead il y increasing demand for financial products with ESG characteristics. Products disclosing under Articles 8 and 9 of the SFDR account for almost 50% of EU Assets under Management (AuM), representing more than 60% of EU funds[4](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote5). Europe is by far the largest market for such funds, accounting for up to 84% of global sustainable fund assets[5](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote6).\n\nThe comprehensive assessment of the SFDR undertaken by the Commission under Article 19 of the Regulation since 2023 has however identified several shortcomings that have emerged since its entry into application. The evidence gathered showed that while the objectives of the SFDR remain broadly supported, several aspects of the rules are considered complex, difficult to implement, and ineffective. Problems of misalignment between concepts and definitions in the SFDR and in other EU sustainable finance legislation, coupled with challenges for financial market participants to access reliable and comprehensive ESG data, have contributed to the complexity of the framework. Evidence shows that the objective of investor protection has not been sufficiently well served, compounded by the misuse of Articles 8 and 9 as quasi-labels and the lack of clarity regarding certain concepts and obligations.\n\nThe review of the SFDR is included among the simplification initiatives in the 2025 Commission Work Programme[6](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote7). In line with the Political Guidelines for 2024-2029[7](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote8), the objective is to stay the course on the goals set out in the European Green Deal, but with simpler rules, lower administrative burden and better enforcement. The need for simplification of the sustainable finance framework to lower compliance costs for companies in the EU was also highlighted in the Report on \u2018The future of European competitiveness[8](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote9)\u2019 by Mario Draghi.\n\nAgainst this background, the Commission proposes to review the SFDR to make it more efficient, simple and proportionate. Key in this effort is ensuring the integrity of the EU single market for sustainable finance by focusing on requirements which mitigate risks of greenwashing and better help investors seize and compare opportunities in sustainability-linked financial products. At the same time, the review aims at boosting the competitiveness of Europe\u2019s financial sector by ensuring conditions which make business easier and deepening the single market for sustainability-linked financial products, thus helping to allocate capital for Europe\u2019s sustainable prosperity.\n\nThe proposed changes pursue two objectives. The first is to simplify and reduce the sustainability-related administrative and disclosure requirements for financial market participants and financial advisers, as well as to enhance the coherence of the framework for the operational needs of financial market participants. The second is to improve end-investors\u2019 ability to understand and compare sustainability-linked financial products, and to protect them against potential misleading ESG claims.\n\nThe present proposal therefore puts forward a considerable simplification of reporting requirements, and a three-way categorisation of financial products with ESG features, incorporating wide stakeholder feedback and building on current market practices.The proposal also makes targeted consequential amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 on packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (PRIIPS)[9](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote10) and repeals Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288[10](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote11), implementing the current SFDR, as of the date of application of the new framework.\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\nThe SFDR is closely linked with other pieces of the sustainable finance framework, including the EU Taxonomy[11](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote12), the EU Benchmarks Regulation[12](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote13), the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)[13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote14), the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD)[14](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote15), as well as relevant parts of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II)[15](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote16),, the Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD)[16](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote17) and the Shareholder Rights Directive (SRD)[17](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote18). Together, they support companies and the financial sector in mobilis ing private funding into sustainable projects and technologies. In particular, reporting obligations for financial market participants under the SFDR build on the reporting obligations for companies under the CSRD and the Taxonomy Regulation. The review of the SFDR is thus necessary to reflect the changes introduced by the proposed \u2018Omnibus\u2019[18](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote19) simplifications regarding sustainability information from companies, in particular the future scope of the corporate disclosures from companies under the CSRD.\n\nThe review also builds on the guidelines by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on funds\u2019 names using ESG or sustainability-related terms[19](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote20). For the purposes of ensuring that ESG claims under the revised SFDR are clear, fair and not misleading, financial market participants should also consult supervisory guidance prepared by the European Supervisory Authorities[20](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote21).Moreover, the notion of ESG-related claims made by financial products regarding how and the extent to which categorised products invest in or contribute to either transition or sustainability objectives, or integrate sustainability factors in their investment strategy beyond sustainability risk management considerations, is consistent with the notion of \u2018environmental claims\u2019 under Article 2(1)(o) of Directive 2005/29/EC (Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, as amended by Directive (EU) 2024/825 as regards empowering consumers for the green transition[21](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote22)). Consistent with Article 3(4) of Directive 2005/29/EC, requirements under th at Directive would be met by proper application of the requirements of this Regulation.\n\nFinally, given that this Regulation adapts the information requirements related to the degree to which financial products invest in sustainability-related activities, including activities that contribute to an environmental objective as set out in Article 9 of the Taxonomy Regulation, the requirement for financial market participants to disclose the information under Articles 5 to 7 of the Taxonomy Regulation is henceforth no longer a blanket obligation but flows from whether and the extent to which they choose to use the Taxonomy Regulation in this respect. Further, the references in those Articles of the Taxonomy Regulation would no longer refer to paragraphs involving disclosures under Article 8 and 9 of the SFDR, but to criteria for sustainability-related product categories, and are thus also moot. Likewise, there is no longer an obligation for these disclosures to mention the statements referred to in Articles 6 and 7 of the Taxonomy Regulation regarding the shares of financial products that take and do not take into account EU criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities under that Regulation.\n\n\u2022Consistency with other Union policies\n\nAs mentioned above, the SFDR review is a simplification initiative in the 2025 Commission Work Programme and part of the follow-up to the Draghi report. The proposed changes aim to facilitate the implementation of the sustainable finance framework. Consistent with the broader simplification agenda and the objective of delivering simpler rules through better implementation under the S avings and I nvestments U nion, the Commission has published a list of non-essential level 2 measures which includes the repeal of several level 2 measures stemming from the SFDR.[22](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote23)\n\nThe updated rules will also address current barriers to the cross-border distribution of financial products with sustainability features which impede the potential of the single market in sustainable finance from effectively mobilising savings towards Europe\u2019s sustainable prosperity.The new rules should therefore promote a more effective functioning of the single market for sustainable finance, including by improving transparency and empowering investors across the Union to participate in EU capital markets in line with the objectives of the Savings and Investments Union[23](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote24).\n\nIn the same spirit of the recently published initiatives to advance the S avings and I nvestment s U nion, such as the recommendations on the Savings and Investment Accounts (SIAs)[24](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote25), the SFDR is also aimed at supporting measures to create better financial opportunities and financial outcomes for citizens who wish to invest. It is specifically designed for individuals looking to grow their savings by investing in financial markets in alignment with their sustainability preferences. In addition, the Commission\u2019s strategy on financial literacy, aimed at helping citizens better understand investment principles, opportunities and risks[25](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote26), will allow citizens and investors to get a greater understanding of the economic effects of choosing to finance certain activities, as well as their impacts and implications for employment, sustainability, social outcomes and resilience.\n\nThe review will contribute to the objectives of the European Green Deal in a more efficient way, including climate neutrality under the Climate Law[26](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote27), the environmental transition supported by an innovative and circular economy, and the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nFinally, the SFDR review builds on the guidance from the Commission on the application of the EU sustainable finance framework regarding the defence sector, presented in the Communication on a European Defence Industrial Strategy[27](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote28) and delivered through the June 2025 Defence Readiness Omnibus[28](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote29), which was announced in the March 2025 Joint White Paper for European Defence Readiness 2030[29](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote30).It is therefore fully consistent with the objectives of the Joint White Paper and the Defence Readiness Roadmap 2030[30](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote31)to further bolster access to finance for the defence and space sector.\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\nThe legal basis of the review is the same as the existing Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, meaning Article 114 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which allows the adoption of measures for the approximation of national provisions having as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market. The revised rules help underpin the effective and efficient functioning of the internal market for sustainable finance, safeguard competition between different financial market participants and incentivise behavioural changes toward greater innovation.\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)\n\nThis proposal complies with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). The need for a coherent common framework for sustainability-related disclosures for financial products across the EU was established as part of the original SFDR. The objectives remain fully valid and enjoy broad stakeholder support. Without effective Union-level action, the problems identified since the entry into force of the Regulation would persist and would not be tackled in an effective, efficient and coherent way. Financial market participants and investors would continue to face undue complexity in the application of the rules. Excessively lengthy disclosure rules and templates involving sustainability characteristics in the business practices of financial market participants, as well as in the financial products they offer to investors, would remain in place. Uncertainty and insufficient comparability would continue to mark the availability of ESG financial products, negatively impacting their credibility and uptake.\n\nGiven the problems outlined above, the necessary simplification and adjustment of the existing SFDR framework can only be implemented in a coherent and effective way at EU level. This effective EU-level action would also help scale up private sustainable finance across the Union, boost the proper functioning of the single market for sustainable finance and ultimately contribute to improving transparency for investors to enable their participation in EU capital markets, in line with the objectives of the Savings and Investments Union.\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\nThe proposed amendments respect the principle of proportionality, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). They do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of simplification, transparency and investor protection, while achieving the scaling up of private sustainable finance in support of Europe\u2019s sustainability and competitiveness goals. In addition, based on the proportionality principle, the present proposal builds on market practices.\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\nThis proposal amends Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 via an amending Regulation. A directly applicable regulation, providing full harmonisation, is needed to address market fragmentation and reduce the scope for additional national rules to tackle perceived shortcomings and ensure the desired simplification of requirements and disclosures, for the benefit of both financial market participants and investors, in a harmonised way throughout the Union.\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\nIn December 2022, the Commission announced a comprehensive assessment of the SFDR framework. Two consultations were issued (one public and one targeted) running from September until December 2023.\n\nThe assessment served to gather feedback on the functioning of the framework and assessing any shortcomings with regard to how well it is achieving its ultimate objectives. In particular, this concerned how the rules were working in terms of helping to attract private funding to facilitate the transition of the European economy towards greater sustainability and, as part of this, empowering investors to better understand and compare the products on offer.\n\nThe assessment and its various steps, outlined in the next section, were recapped in an evaluation of the SFDR, carried out as part of the impact assessment accompanying this proposal (see under \u2018Impact assessment\u2019 below). The evaluation results help identify and confirm the key problem drivers, and inform the lessons learned for the review.\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\nThe following section provides an overview of the stakeholder consultations carried out for the review:\n\n\u2013Targeted and open public consultations\n\n\u2013Technical workshops and roundtables\n\n\u2013Commission expert group opinions (Platform for Sustainable Finance \u2013 PSF)\n\n\u2013Input from the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs)\n\n\u2013Engagement with Member States\n\n\u2013Continuous engagement with experts\n\n\u2013Call for Evidence\n\nTargeted and open public consultations\n\nTwo public consultations ran from September to December 2023 (targeted[31](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote32) and open[32](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote33)). A summary report[33](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote34) was published in May 2024.\n\n324 organisations and individuals participated in the targeted consultation. Financial market participants and financial advisers made up the largest group of respondents, followed by NGOs. Respondents were predominantly from EU countries. Respondents from non-EU countries were mostly from the UK and the US.\n\nThe responses showed significant support for the SFDR policy goals but mixed views on how the implementation of the regulation delivered against its specific objectives. The majority of respondents agreed that the SFDR was currently not being used solely as a disclosure framework as intended, but also as a labelling and marketing tool (in particular the disclosures under Article 8 and 9). Many also highlighted that inconsistencies between different parts of the sustainable finance framework pose challenges for both financial market participants and end investors and queried whether the SFDR is the right place to set entity-level disclosure requirements to inform investors. Most respondents called for the disclosures and sustainability-related concepts to be simplified and made more meaningful for investors.\n\nThe majority of respondents supported setting up an EU categorisation system for ESG financial products, focused on retail investors, accounting for the international investments of EU financial products, and leveraging existing market practices.\n\nTechnical workshops and roundtables\n\nTo complement the replies to the targeted and open consultations, the Commission held four technical workshops to gather further technical comments. The workshops took place in October and December 2023, and in January 2024. An additional technical roundtable was conducted with consumers\u2019 associations in December 2024 to analyse the existing EU consumer testing studies on retail investors\u2019 sustainability preferences and understanding.\n\nPSF opinions\n\nThe Platform for Sustainable Finance (PSF), a Commission expert group, submitted input in two opinions. The first, from December 2023[34](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote35)addresses the main questions raised by the Commission in the targeted consultation. In December 2024, the PSF published a second opinion[35](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote36), outlining how a categorisation system for sustainable finance products could be set up and calibrated, with a proposal to set up three categories (called \u2018sustainable\u2019, \u2018transition\u2019 and \u2018ESG collection\u2019). The opinion covered the current state of ESG financial markets and the potential impact that setting certain thresholds could have on current products falling under Articles 8 and 9 of the SFDR.\n\nInput from the ESAs\n\nThe European Supervisory Authorities delivered in June 2024 a joint opinion on the assessment of the SFDR[36](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote37) where they suggested to set up new categories, a \u2018sustainable product\u2019 category and a \u2018transition product\u2019 category. ESMA published its own further opinion \u201cSustainable investments: facilitating the investor journey\u201d in July 2024 where among other things it strongly encouraged the establishment of a categorisation system[37](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote38).\n\nEngagement with Member States\n\nThe European Commission engaged with Member States in the context of the Member State s Expert Group[38](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote39) in two meetings (December 2024[39](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote40) and June 2025[40](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote41)), requesting their feedback and comments. The Commission also received numerous letters and position papers from Member State authorities and National Competent Authorities (NCAs) presenting their views on the review of the SFDR.\n\nContinuous engagement with experts\n\nThe European Commission engaged continuously with experts such as financial market participants, investors, NGOs, consumers\u2019 associations, trade associations, academics and other interested stakeholders, on key challenges with the current SFDR and on how to set up categories.\n\nCall for Evidence\n\nFinally, the Commission gathered feedback during the Call for Evidence which ran from 2 May to 30 May 2025[41](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote42). 195 stakeholders submitted their views. The largest group of respondents were businesses associations and companies, followed by NGOs, and to a lesser extent, national authorities. Respondents were predominantly from EU countries, with France, Germany, Belgium, Italy and Netherlands being the most represented.\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\nIn addition to the feedback collected above, the Commission reviewed several studies and additional data sources, from both stakeholder and academic sources, including the study requested by the ECON Committee of the European Parliament on \u201cthe current implementation of the SFDR\u201d[42](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote43), quoted in the impact assessment accompanying the proposal.\n\nMaterial used to prepare the impact assessment and inform policy choices comes from diverse market participants and stakeholders, as well as other reputable and well-recognised sources. Findings were cross-checked across different information sources to avoid biases caused by outliers or vested interests.\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\nAn impact assessment was carried out to prepare this legislative proposal. On 2 July 2025, the impact assessment report was examined by the Regulatory Scrutiny Board (RSB). Following a first negative opinion, the Board issued a positive opinion with reservations on 8 October 2025.\n\nIn its comments, the RSB notably requested that the policy options should be better specified to allow for an adequate assessment and comparison, that the option of repealing the SFDR should be fully assessed alongside other options, that the coherence with the simplifications under the Omnibus proposals should be better established, and that the feasibility of creating reliable categories should be better evidenced including given challenges with ESG data availability impacted by the Omnibus. A more detailed description of what the policy options would concretely look like was thus added, mainly by providing illustrative details for the future streamlined disclosures, to be further specified in implementing measures, and more detailed criteria for the three proposed categories. A full analysis of the repeal option was added, along with further analysis to demonstrate the steps needed in the review to ensure coherence with the Omnibus. Further evidence was added on the feasibility to set ESG disclosures that would be meaningful and would be based on broadly available, comparable and credible sustainability information which responds to investors\u2019 demand. Finally, the analysis of costs, benefits and savings was further substantiated to support the above, based on data which was available and reliable. The policy options explored in the impact assessment aim at defining the essential features of the disclosures and categories for the revised Regulation, clearly framing the limited areas for supplementary rules needed in future implementing measures. Besides coherence between the SFDR and the rest of the sustainable finance framework, including the changes entailed by the Omnibus in terms of sustainability disclosures applicable to corporates, an important consideration was recognising and building upon current market practices, to ensure a sufficient degree of continuity with appropriate criteria in the categorisation of products that are already being applied by markets, namely building on the ESMA fund name guidelines[43](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote44).\n\nTo achieve the objectives set for the review, the preferred options were assessed to be:\n\n(i) deleting disclosures at entity level regarding principal adverse impacts, largely cancelling out the costs associated with entity-level disclosures (25% of the overall costs linked to the disclosures, saving an annual total of EUR 56 million in recurring costs), and removing any duplication between the SFDR and CSRD;\n\n(ii) significantly reducing product-level disclosures, refocusing on templates for categorised products with fewer sustainability indicators, facilitating comparability and investors\u2019 decisions, and considerably cutting the recurring costs linked to product disclosures;\n\n(iii) setting up 3 categories for \u2018sustainable\u2019, \u2018transition\u2019, and \u2018ESG basic s\u2019 products[44](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote45), covering a significant share of today\u2019s ESG financial products, ensuring a coherent set of EU rules for all ESG-focused products toward which end-investors interested in sustainability could be directed by distributors (under subsequent changes to the delegated acts under MiFID and IDD). While some initial one-off costs from the creation of product categories are anticipated, recurring costs are expected to be lower than those of the current SFDR in the longer term and, overall, are offset by the savings achieved by the other elements of the review.\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\nThe combination of the preferred options has the potential to considerably simplify and improve the efficiency of the legislation. The proposal is directly relevant for SMEs who represent the majority of financial market participants in scope. Well over 25% of the estimated costs for SMEs with the current rules (about EUR 163 million of annual recurring costs, of which about EUR 43 million are for entity-level disclosures and EUR 120 million for product level disclosures) are expected to be reduced. The reduction of entity-level costs in the present proposal is certain with only minimal one-off costs, and while sufficient data could not be gathered on costs associated with the creation of product categories, it can be expected that more than 50% of product-level costs can be saved thanks to the significant reduction of product-level disclosures. In addition, SMEs would benefit more than proportionally from simplification as pronounced cost digression effects are observed, i.e. in relative terms SMEs incur much higher costs than larger firms due to certain minimum efforts that are necessary to build and maintain sustainability-related disclosures.\n\nSMEs are also indirectly affected as investees, as they can, together with the safeguards of the Omnibus (value chain cap), benefit from the flow of funds and be included in products under a simple categorisation system.\n\nIn conclusion, the reduced administrative requirements linked to the removal of entity-level disclosures eliminates burdens estimated to account for 25% of the costs under the current rules, largely incumbent on financial market participants which are SMEs. In addition, the simplification of product-level disclosures and introduction of product categories building on market practices, which overall are expected to allow cost savings, are estimated to facilitate further overall burden reduction for SMEs toward the 35% target.\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\nThe proposal promotes rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (the \u2018Charter\u2019). It integrates due consideration for the respect of human rights, gender equality, fair and just working conditions and prohibition of child labour by companies (Articles 5, 23, 31 and 32 of the Charter), a high level of environmental protection (Article 37 of the Charter) as well as social cohesion (Article 36 of the Charter) and consumer protection (Article 38 of the Charter) since its main objective is to protect the integrity of the EU single market for sustainable finance by ensuring requirements which mitigate risks of greenwashing, and to better help investors seize opportunities in sustainability-linked financial products.\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe proposal does not have a budgetary impact for the Commission.\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\nThe Commission will monitor the implementation of the changes proposed in the Regulation through established processes underway in particular with the European Supervisory Authorities and the Platform for Sustainable Finance (PSF).\n\nThree years after the entry into application of the Regulation, the ESAs and the NCAs would be tasked to survey and assess the implementation costs linked to the new categorisation system. The Commission could also work with the ESAs to conduct regular assessments of occurrences of greenwashing and supervise sustainability-related claims, and with the PSF to conduct a targeted analysis of the regime and assess the degree of uptake of the categorisation system and the implementation of simplified disclosures. Finally, the Commission would work with the ESAs and consumer associations to measure consumer satisfaction a few years after the implementation of the regime.\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\nArticle 1 introduces the following amendments to Regulation (EU) 2019/2088:\n\n(1)Changes to the subject matter (Article 1 SFDR) to reflect the revised scope focused on financial market participants who manufacture, make available or manage financial products (i.e. removing financial advisers who do not carry out this activity from the scope) and including the creation of categories for sustainability-related financial products.\n\n(2)Consequential changes to some definitions, including notably the deletion of financial advisers and the addition of definitions for categorised \u2018sustainability-related\u2019 products as well as those categorised pro ducts claiming to achieve \u2018impact\u2019 as part of their strategy (Article 2 SFDR).\n\n(3)Deletion of Article 2a SFDR on the empowerment for ESAs to develop regulatory technical standards to be adopted by the Commission regarding the principle of do no significant harm, consistent with the list published by the Commission of implementing measures considered non-essential (\u2018de-prioritisation list\u2019)[45](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote46).\n\n(4)Amendment of Article 3 to re flect removal of financial advisers from the scope.\n\n(5)Deletion of entity-level disclosure requirements in Articles 4 and 5 regarding, respectively, principal adverse impact s and remuneration policies, also consistent with the de-prioritisation list.\n\n(6)Amendment of Article 6 to re flect removal of financial advisers from the scope.\n\n(7)Addition of new Article 6a on specific transparency restrictions for non-categorised products, as a result of the creation of categories for \u2018sustainab ility-related financial products\u2019. Notably, to protect investors, non-categorised products, while not prevented from including information in the ir pre-contractual and periodic d isclosures on whether and how th ey consider sustainability factors, are required to ensure that such information is not a central element of those disclosures and do es not constitute sustainability-related claims reserved for categorised products.\n\n(8)Creation of categories for financial products with transition (Article 7), ESG basic s(Article 8), or sustainable features (Article 9), including the main criteria for financial products to qualify in each category, th e exclusions which products in each category should not invest in, and the information to be disclosed to investors. The revised Articles also repeal the previous empowerments, in accordance with the de-prioritisation list.The order of the revised Articles re flect s continuity with the existing usage of, notably, Articles 8 and 9 as shorthand for products with different environmental and social features.\n\n(9)Addition of new Article 9a on financial products investing in or combining categorised products, to clarify when these products are e l i gible to meet the criteria of a given category, and to set out transparency rules for how non-categorised financial products which invest in categorised financial products,but not in the amounts which would qualify those products as categ orised themselves, should disclose information about those investments.N otably, such products should set out what share of their investments are in categorised financial products, relying on the information regarding the latter provided by financial market participants in the investment chain.\n\n(10)Amendment of Article 10 on website disclosures by financial market participants, reflecting the revised sco p e, the creation of categories for \u2018sustainability-related financial products\u2019, and consistent with the de-prioritisation list.\n\n(11)Amendment of Article 11 on periodic disclosures by financial market participants on an annual basis, reflecting the revised scope, the creation of categories for \u2018sustainability-related financial products\u2019, and consistent with the de-prioritisation list.\n\n(12)Change to Article 12, to re flect removal of financial advisers from the scope.\n\n(13)Addition of a new Article 12a setting out principles for financial market participants on the use of data and estimates for the purposes of this Regulation as well as rules on the information to be provided to investors upon request on relevant data source s and assumptions underpinning estimates.\n\n(14)Amendments to Article 13 on marketing communications and naming rules, notably reflecting the revised scope, the creation of categories for \u2018sustainability-related financial products\u2019, and consistent with the de-prioritisation lis t.Namely, sustainability-re lated claims in names and marketing communications would only be allowed for categorised products, w ith the exception of non-categorised products under Article 9a that would be able to make such claims in marketing communications but not their names.In addition, amendments to Article 13 incorporate disclosure requirements from Regulation (EU) 2024/3005 for financial market participants that include ESG rating s in their marketing documentations, ensuring that information on such ratings is available as part of the website disclosures.\n\n(15)Amendment of Article 14 to reflect the revised scope and preclude additional national level requirements in order to avoid that these would go beyond information requirements and criteria for \u2018sustainability-related financial products\u2019 in th e revised Regulation and cause fragmentation in the internal market.\n\n(16)Change to Article 15 to reflect the revised scope.\n\n(17)Addition of o ptional exemptions in Article 17 for specific types of products, notably of the closed-end ed type created before the entry into application of the revised Regulation as well as a clarification that the creation of categories for \u2018sustainability-related financial products\u2019 is without prejudice to labelling schemes with additional features in terms of transparency, governance and other requirements.\n\n(18)Revision to Article 18 (reporting by ESAs) to reflect the revised subject matter and scope of the Regulation.\n\n(19)Consequential targeted changes to Article 18a (European single access point).\n\n(20)Changes to the review clause (Article 19) to reflect the revised subject matter and scope of the Regulation.\n\n(21)Addition of new Articles 19a, 19b and 19c (transitional provisions for insurance and pension products which are n ot affected by the ESMA fund name guidelines, and Commission empowerment s to specify the conditions for investments to contribute to given transition-related or sustainability-related objectives or to integrate sustainability factors for the categorisation of financial products as sustainability-related products, and the  disclosure requirements for these categorised financial products via delegated acts).\n\nArticle 2 amends Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 notably by specifying disclosures to be included in the key information document for sustainability-related products to indicate which category they fall under.\n\nArticle 3 repeals Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288, containing implementing measures adopted under the current SFDR, as from the date of application of the revised Regulation.\n\n2025/0361 (COD)\n\nProposal for a\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\namending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector (SFDR), Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 on key information documents for packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (PRIIPs) and repealing Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[46](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote47),\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\nWhereas:\n\n(1)The March 2018 Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth[47](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote48) set out a series of steps to help mobilise private capital toward s more sustainable economic practices and improved sustainability-related risk management in the financial sector, in the wake of, notably,the Paris Agreement[48](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote49)on climate change and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development[49](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote50). Among the ensuing actions, the Commission proposed, and co-legislators a dopted Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council,[50](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote51) to improve transparency on the consideration of sustainability risks and factors by financial market participants in financial services and financial products offered to investors.\n\n(2)The Communication on the European Green Deal[51](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote52)recalled the importance of ensuring the mobilisation of private finance towards the obj ective of transforming \u201cthe EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use\u201d.The steps taken pursuant to the Green Deal have consistently affirmed the important role of private finance in helping to achiev e climate neutrality by 2050 in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council[52](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote53),specific sectoral sustainability targets in th at context[53](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote54), and the objectives of the REPowerEU plan[54](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote55) to accelerate the development of secure and sustainable energy in the U nion and reduce dependency on imported fossil fuels.Commission analyses ha ve consistently highlighted the magnitude of investments needed to achieve the EU\u2019s climate objectives: over the 2030 \u2013 2050 period, approximately EUR 650 b illio n (in 2023 EUR) will have to be allocated yearly for the transition of the energy system alone across a variety of scenarios. In that context,u nlocking and facilitating sustainability-oriented priv ate f unds is critical for the Union to properly contribute financially to the New Collective Quantified Goal set at COP 29 and the additional climate finance goal to mobilise USD 1,3 t rillio n a year from 2035, to boost its resilience in the face of climate change[55](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote56) and to support the plan for EU competitiveness and decarbonisation (The Clean Industrial Deal)[56](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote57).It is also aligned with efforts to bo ost the defence industry of the Union[57](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote58)by ensuring that the sustainable finance framework does not prevent capital from be ing directed towards defence-related activities, and help contribute to deliver ing a more integrated single market for savings and investments to support economic growth, innovation and competitiveness in the Union[58](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote59).\n\n(3)Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 has been instrumental in improving transparency as regards the opportunities and risks in investments supporting or integrating diverse sustainability-oriented aims and considerations. Financial market participants have a common set of principles and requirements for the provision of sustainability-related information regarding financial products and services they offer. R egulation (EU) 2019/2088 benefitted i nvestors in terms of a more structured framework for how th at information is presented to them, helping competition, choice and comparability between financial products and services with sustainability-related features and aims, even if not to the full of its potential. National competent authorities in charge of monitoring compliance of financial market participants with the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 have set up practices in relation to risks of greenwashing and developed a more common supervisory framework for their oversight.\n\n(4)Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, however, has been marked by implementation challenges both for financial market participants and for investors. A comprehensive assessment under Article 19 of the Regulation has found that, while its objectives remain broadly supported, the Regulation\u2019s implementation is associated with considerable complexity and cost s for financial market participants. In addition, the information provided to end-investors has not, on the whole, been sufficiently clear and effective in helping those end-investors understand and compare diverse sustainability-related financial products and services offered to them. Disclosures to investors under Articles 8 and 9 of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 have also been used by the market in a misleading way to categorise financial products as sustainable despite the lack of criteria that could fit this purpose. D isclosures under th o se Articles have also been marked by varying interpretation s and implementation practices,which led to in sufficient clarity for end-investors. In addi tion, diverging interpretations by national competent authorities also emerged and supervisory practices and expectations have been impacted by the need to adapt to the introduction of new common guidelines for the use of environmental, social and governance terms in the names of investment funds (\u201cESMA guidelines on funds names\u201d)[59](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote60).Th o se implementation challenges have led to undue costs and burdens for the financial sector of the Union compared to international competit ors, to a lack of investor protection and risks of greenwashing, and to differing national requirements and supervisory practices that are at odds with the integrity of the single market. Overall,the challenges are seen to limit the effectiveness of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 in exploit ing the potential of the single market to mobilise and allocate private finance for the sustainable prosperity of the Union.\n\n(5)Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 is part of the wider sustainable finance framework,elements of which are undergoing targeted amendments to simplify, streamline and reduce the burden of sustainability-related disclosures and requirements on U nion undertakings. Th o se amendments should ensure a more cost-effective delivery of the overall ambition of the European Green Deal while not undermining its agreed policy objectives[60](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote61). As part of that wider sustainable finance framework, Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 should also be reviewed commensurately. Th at is why its revi sion has been included among the simplification initiatives of the Commission in the Mission Letter to the Commissioner for Financial Services and the Savings and Investments Union[61](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote62) and in the 2025 Commission Work Programme[62](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote63). The objectives of the revi sion are to overcome the shortcoming s associated with the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, to significantly simplify administrative burdens in a coherent way with the rest of the U nion sustainable finance framework, and to help i nvestors efficiently understand and compare sustainability-related financial products.\n\n(6)Within th at context, it is for the benefit of both end-investors and financial market participants to alleviate specific burdens flowing from Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 on financial market participants,and to formalise a comprehensive categorisation regime for financial products making sustainability-related claims. Th ose categories are to set up a clea r system according to which sustainability-related financial products should be clustered, in accordance with how th ose products claim to end-investors to pursue or achieve specific sustainability-related objectives or to integrate the consideration of specific sustainability-related factors.To harmonise the implementation and supervisory practices and further protect end-investors against greenwashing and misleading claims, t hose categories should rely on a clear set of criteria.\n\n(7)It is necessary to adjust the scope of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 and to adjust certain definitions there in to reflect th o se objectives. Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 should continue to require financial market participants to disclose how they consider sustainability risks affect the financial products they offer to investors. Beyond these elemen t s, Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 should, however,focus exclusively on the specific requirements and associated disclosure s applicable to financial market participants which manufacture, manage or make available sustainability-related financial products, particularly those that reference sustainability-related elements in their names or marketing documentation to end-investors. F inancial advisers providing investment advice do not manufacture or manage sustainability-related financial products, nor do they make such products available to investors. For that reason, financial advisors providing investment advice should be carved out of the scope of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 altogether.Their role is rather as distributors to identify the products made available by financial market participants that match their clients\u2019 sustainability preferences. The rules for distributors should therefore duly reflect the changes introduced by this Regulation, especially the categorisation regime for financial products making sustainability-related claims.The same applies to the service of portfolio management, consisting of managing portfolios of financial instruments in accordance with mandates given by clients on a discretionary client-by-client basis and which are thus not designed and marketed the same way as products identified for certain target markets.\n\n(8)The definition in Article 2, point (17), of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of sustainable investment has generated a considerable number of practical implementation challenges and concerns, queries to supervisors about interpretation and their expectations, and wide divergence in practical application. Practitioners also perceive duplication and coherence issues with comparable concepts laid down elsewhere in th e sustainable finance framework but which have a slightly different meaning, including those laid down in Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council[63](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote64), and undue constraints for investments targeting the transition of undertakings or economic activities toward s sustainability in accordance with the policy outlined in the Commission Recommendation (EU) 2023/1435 in 2023[64](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote65). At the same time, the definition of sustainable investment in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 is used by financial market participants in the design of financial products and the communication with end-investors. The practical application of the term should thus be facilitated by deleting the definition of sustainable investment, thus overcoming the uncertainty in aligning practices with it, and instead embedding the underlying concept s in a simplified form in the concrete requirements for the associated categor y of sustainability-related financial products. That would ensure continuity, simplified application and improved certainty for financial market participants. Therefore, the concepts of contribution to an environmental and social objective, of do not significant harm, and of good governance practices should continue to be reflected in the criteria of the relevant categories.\n\n(9)T o encourage investments contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation, the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, the transition to a circular economy, to pollution prevention and control, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems, e nvironmental objective s of sustainability related financial products should be defined according to Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852.S ocial objective s of sustainability related financial products should be understood as includ ing the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights[65](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote66) and the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n(10)The proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives (EU) 2022/2464 and (EU) 2024/1760[66](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote67) aims at an overall simplification and burden-reduction of sustainability disclosures and, focus their requirements on the largest companies. That same aim justifies focussing the scope of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 on sustainability-related financial products and on the financial market participants which manufacture, manage or make those products available to investors. In addition, Directive (EU) 2022/2464 already sets horizontal entity level disclosures of sustainability information covering all sectors. T herefore, the deletion of the specific requirements for financial market participants to make disclosures on their consideration of adverse impacts in their investment decisions at the level of the entity ensures no  duplicat ion in disclosure requirements for entities also in scope of Directive (EU) 2022/2464.\n\n(11)Financial market participants should not be prohibited from referring to information on sustainability aspects of an ancillary nature in the regulatory disclosures related to financial products even if not categorised as sustainability-related financial products. Such information should be fair, clear and not misleading. However, to protect investors and distinguish clearly between non-categorised and categorised financial products, such information should not constitute a prominent element in those disclosures and should not feature in the name or marketing communications of such financial products. In addition, for financial products that are categorised as sustainability-related financial products, financial market participants should ensure that the claims in the regulatory, marketing documentations and names of their sustainability-related financial products are consistent with the category under which they fall and their strategies.\n\n(12)Building on the feedback received during the targeted and open public consultations, the technical workshops and roundtables, the Commission expert group\u2019 reports and the call for evidence, as well as evidence of investor preferences in diverse consumer studies, there is a need to set up EU categories for products making sustainability-related claims. Such categories are called for to address the current misuse of the Article 8 and 9 disclosures and to harmonise at EU level the implementation and supervisory practices for products making sustainability-related claims. Such categories should rely on clear criteria to combat greenwashing, facilitate end-investors understanding of products\u2019 sustainability-related strategies and objectives, and allow for an efficient distribution system based on investors\u2019 sustainability preferences. Feedback favours the creation of three categories which should be distinguished in terms of their claims. The sustainable category should cover products claiming to invest in companies, assets, activities or projects that are already sustainable or pursue a particular objective related to sustainability factors, including environmental or social objective s. The transition category should cover products claiming to invest in companies, assets, activities or projects that are on a credible path to sustainability or that pursue particular environmental or social transition-related objectives. The ESG basics category should cover products claiming to integrate other sustainability considerations beyond sustainability risks in their investment strategy. This approach would also be consistent with recent regulatory guidance by the European Securities and Markets Authority[67](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote68). These c laims by financial products are consistent with the notion of \u2018environmental claims\u2019 under Directive 2005/29/EC[68](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote69) (Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, as amended by Directive (EU) 2024/825 as regards empowering consumers for the green transition[69](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote70)). Consistent with Article 3(4) of Directive 2005/29/EC, requirements under that Directive are met by proper application of the requirements of this Regulation.\n\n(13)Such categories should help distributors identify the products that match their clients\u2019 sustainability preferences and perform their target market assessment and should therefore be reflected in the rules applicable under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565[70](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote71), C ommission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593[71](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote72),and Commission Delegated Regulations (EU) 2017/2358[72](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote73) and (EU) 2017/2359[73](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote74). This would provide end-investors with a clear understanding of the main features and ambitions of sustainability-related products.\n\n(14)To help comparability and boost integrity, a minimum portion of 70% of investments by financial products in each category should be made in accordance with the sustainability-related claim, i.e. the objective that is pursued or the sustainability-related considerations that are applied. Financial market participants should be allowed to freely allocate t he remaining investments based on diversification, hedging or liquidity needs. The se remaining investments should not contradict the sustainability-related claims of the financial product. The full implementation of an investment strategy for a given financial product can take a certain period of time, especially for alternative or private assets. That period of time is communicated in pre-contractual documents. The percentage of investments necessary to meet the objectives of the product may not be immediately reached during that phase-in period. The percentage should be attained at the latest at the expiry of the phase-in period. The 70% threshold would mean an increase in ambition compared to the 50% minimum portion of \u2018sustainable investment\u2019 required for funds using a sustainability-related term in their names under the ESMA guidelines on funds\u2019 names. It is also considered to allow for continuity with the rule of having 80% of investments made in accord ance with the ESG claim pursued with the fund name under th o se guidelines, considering that the conditions for the 70% threshold would be stricter than the current 80% under the ESMA guidelines (i.e. new conditions for investments to be deemed as contributing to a sustainability or transition related objectives or as integrating sustainability-related considerations). Finally, it allows for sufficient margin for hedging investments, and is aligned with other international investment labels, which would facilitate international convergence. To guide financial market participants and provide them with certainty, specific investment approaches for financial products should be identified per category, but without excluding other possible approaches in each case under the condition that these provide for the same level of sustainability-related ambition.Findings from recent evaluations show that there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 on how to granularly specify what a positive contribution to a sustainability objective or transition should be. Th at is mainly due to the wide variety of assets, strategies, sustainability objectives or factors that exist in the current market. A closed list of granular criteria for contribution would therefore res trict the investment universe too much and risk hinder ing innovati ve practices. Instead, the list of possible approaches should aim at identifying robust existing sustainability standards and encouraging their use.T he 70% threshold should focus on ensuring harmonised levels of contribution rather than granularly specify the nature of the contribution for each category. Specific disclosures on the chosen approach to contribution should be given to end-investors.Financial m arket participants should measure their contribution, the compliance with the strategy and the progress toward s the sustainability objective, through appropriate sustainability-related indicators and disclose th ose indicators. A list of voluntary indicators should be developed for this purpose. Such indicators should build on the indicators referred to in Annex I of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2772, and on information disclosed by companies, ensuring,to the extent appropriate, continuity with current market practices under this Regulation. T his would encourage harmonisation and comparability in the way financial market participants measure and disclose their contribution to an objective.\n\n(15)The criteria for these categories should also simplify the way financial products today using the sustainable investment definition are required to manage principal adverse impacts on environmental or social objective s. The current approach mandates financial market participants to consider the principal adverse impact indicators on sustainability factors, currently set out in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288[74](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote75). Stakeholders\u2019 f eedback highlights that this approach has not led to a robust or comparable mechanism to ensure no harm. Therefore, the current approach should be replaced by mandating financial market participants to apply a common set of clear exclusions covering practices and sectors which are commonly agreed to be most harmful and to identify and disclose the principal adverse impacts of their investments on sustainability factors. These should include, where relevant, adverse impacts on climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation, the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, the transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. Financial market participants should also disclose any actions taken to address the identified principal adverse impacts. In the specific context of this framework, t his would ensure a comparable and clear approach to ensure no harm. Such approach has been considered successful and effective under the implementation of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818. Such exclusions should also ensure, to the extent possible, continuity with the existing regulatory framework, including with the exclusions laid down in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 and in the ESMA guidelines on funds names and also rely on data available from investee companies or data that can be reasonably estimated by financial market participants. Such exclusions should reflect politically agreed environment al and social goals.\n\n(16)The transition category should consist of financial products that aim to support the transition of undertakings, economic activities and other assets towards sustainability, or contribute to such tr ansition. This category aims at providing such products with disclosures and criteria which accurately reflect transition strategies and address t he current implementation challenges arising from the lack of recognition of transition financ e in the definition of sustainable investment in Article 2, point (17), of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088.Such challenges include difficulties for financial market participants wanting to pursue and disclose transition-related stra tegies as well as confusion and lack of appropriate disclosures for end-investors interested in investing in products with transitional objective. This category should therefore bolster the visibility, transparency and integrity of financial products which invest in the transition of undertakings, economic activities, or other assets towards better environmental or social performance, or that contribute to the environmental or social transition. Th is category should therefore capture financial products with a high level of transition ambition, selecting notably investments based on proven standards and tools, including centred on strategies tracking or replicating EU Climate Transition benchmarks (CTB)or EU Paris-aligned benchmarks (PAB) in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council[75](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote76), on investing in transitional economic activities or in undertakings investing their capital expenditures in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852, or o n investing in undertakings or economic activities that commit to future improvements through credible transition plans or science-based targets. This category should also capture financial products with a transition-related performance set at the level of the portfolio, such as reducing portfolio financed emission over time, under the condition that the underlying investments are coherent with the transition-related objective of the products.To ensure a meaningful contribution to the international and European climate goals, financial products which pursue a climate change mitigation objective should align their ambition with th at in the Paris Agreement and in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, in particular for financial market participants relying on transition plans and science-based targets from companies or projects, or when pursuing a sustainability-related engagement strategy with investee companies. This category should also exclude activities which are commonly agreed to be harmful to the environment and society, while giving investors the possibility to invest in companies at different starting points in their transition efforts. These exclusions should ensure sufficient alignment with the ones defined under the EU Climate Benchmarks and introduced by the ESMA guidelines on funds names for all funds using certain ESG terms in their names, including \u2018transition\u2019-related terms. They should cover activities related to prohibited weapons as defined in the upcoming amendment to Regulation (EU) 2020/1818[76](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote77), the cultivation and production of tobacco, violations of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) principles or the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (OECD MNEs), and hard coal and lignite. This category should also exclude companies developing new projects linked to oil or gaseous fuels, and companies developing new projects, or without a plan to phase-out from, hard coal or lignite for power generation.Moreover, like products falling under the sustainable category, products falling under the transition category should identify and disclose the principal adverse impacts of their investments on sustainability factors, and explain any actions taken to address those impacts.\n\n(17)The ESG basics category should consist of financial products the strategy or design of which is based on selected sustainability factors. Feedback received during the targeted and open public consultations, the technical workshops and roundtables, the Commission expert group\u2019 reports and the call for evidence, as well as evidence of investor preferences in diverse consumer studies, highlights the need to cater for such financial products to allow for innovative sustainability approaches and for end-investor preferences which include products avoiding harmful investments. The criteria should cater for investments which do not specifically pursue a sustainability or transition related objective but integra te sustainability factors in their investment strategies through credible sustainability-related approaches. The criteria should list several approaches which could be adopted by financial market participants, such as outperformance of the investment universe of reference benchmarks measured by an ESG rating or a sustainability indicator,a combination of sustainable or transition standards, as well as investments that favour undertakings or economic activities with a proven positive track record on certain sustainability factors.This category should also exclude activities which are commonly agreed to be harmful to the environment and society in alignment with the ones defined under the EU Climate Benchmarks and introduced by the ESMA guidelines on funds names for all funds using ESG terms, but \u2018sustainab ility-related terms or \u2018impact\u2019-related ones. They should cover activities related to prohibited weapons as defined in the upcoming amendment to Regulation (EU) 2020/1818, the cultivation and production of tobacco, violations of the UNGC principles or OECD MNEs, and hard coal and lignite.\n\n(18)The sustainable category should consist of financial products that invest in companies, assets or activities that are sustainable or that pursu e or positive ly contribut e to environmental and / or social objectives. This category should capture financial products with a high level of ambition in th at regard, selecting notably investments based on proven standards and tools, including centred on strategies replicating or managed in reference to an EU Paris-aligned benchmarks in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council[77](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote78),on invest ing in sustainable economic activities in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852, on in vesting in instruments issued in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2023/2631 of the European Parliament and of the Council[78](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote79),and on investments in relation to operations benefiting from a Union budgetary guarantee or financial instruments under Union progr ammes pursuing environmental or social objectives.Accordingly, the exclusions for f inancial products in th is category should extend beyond those for the other two categories and encompass activities where the value chain is associated with fossil fuels, including the expansion of fossil fuels.In particular, t he exclusions should include the ones of the transition and ESG basics category, in addition to activities linked to oil fuels, gaseous fuels, electricity generation with a GHG intensity of more than 100 g CO2 e/kWh. This category should also exclude companies developing new projects linked to oil or gaseous fuels, and companies developing new projects, or without a plan to phase-out from, hard coal or lignite for power generation. Moreover, beyond these exclusions, products falling under the sustainable category should identify and disclose the principal adverse impacts of their investments on sustainability factors, and explain any actions taken to address those impacts. This requirement would complement the common binary exclusions and ensure that any other principal adverse impacts on sustainability factors are identified, disclosed, and potentially addressed. It would bring accurate transparency on adverse impacts, therefore allowing end-investors to understand the potential harm of such products, while bringing more legal clarity on the required obligation to financial market participants than the current principle of \u2018consideration\u2019 of principal adverse impact indicators. I ndicators should be developed that build on the current principal adverse impact indicators referred to in Annex I to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1888 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2772 for voluntary use by financial market participants when complying with the identification and disclosure of principal adverse impacts. However, financial market participants should have the flexibility to disclose these principal adverse impacts using a different approach, such as different indicators or a qualitative explanation of such impacts and actions, if it fits better the nature of the impact identified or addressed. This flexibility on how to identify the impacts should allow them to focus on the impacts which are actually relevant for their products depending on the assets, strategies and objectives pursued. This requirement would align to a certain degree with existing criteria in other international frameworks while ensuring that the EU rules remain more ambitious including through the implementation of common binary exclusions.\n\n(19)To encourage the use of well-established EU standards, the sustainable and transition category should provide for appropriate treatment and legal cert ainty for products relying on the EU Taxonomy and the EU Climate Benchmarks. Products replicating or managed in reference to an EU Paris-aligned benchmark should be considered as products qualifying under the sustainable and transition category. Similarly, products replicating or managed in reference to an EU Climate Transition benchmark should be considered as products qualifying under the transition category. In addition, products with a proportion of T axonomy-aligned investment equal or higher than 15% should be considered product s complying with the contribution criteria of the sustainable and transition category. The latter would still need to apply the exclusions mandated under the category they wish to comply with on the portion of the portfolio that is not aligned with the EU Taxonomy. Based on the opinion of the Platform for Sustainable Finance, the 15% threshold provides for sufficient incentive for products to aim for an ambition portion of investment in Taxonomy-aligned economic activities while being aligned with the current state of the market. More specifically, this threshold should be attainable by about half of the current investment funds disclosing under Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. The threshold should be subject to review 36 months after the date of application to continue to align it with the state of the broader economy and reflect any development under the EU Taxonomy in order to ensure it provides the right incentive.These provisions aim at simplifying the implementation of the categories, enhancing the coherence of the EU sustainable finance framework, and encouraging the use of these EU labels and standards by providing certainty to their users.\n\n(20)Within the categories of products with sustainab ility and transition-related objectives, r ecognition should be given to the practice of impact investing. Acknowledging the specific characteristics of impact investing, including the objective of intentionality and target ing measurable change in s pecific pre-defined environmental or social areas with an upfront theory of change and with reporting on the outcomes, helps to promote the contribution which impact investing can make to addressing various environmental and social need s. Specific disclosures should therefore apply to financial product s that are categorised as sustainability-related financial products with sustainability or transition-related objectives and that pursue specific impact s as understood for these type s of investment practices. T he use of the term \u2018impact\u2019 in the names of financial products should be restricted accordingly.\n\n(21)Pre-contractual and periodic disclosures for financial products that are categorised as sustainability-related product should contain all relevant information about the objective, strategy, and investment approaches to comply with the 70% requirement, chosen indicators for measuring performance, compliance with applicable exclusions, and relevant data sources used to inform the design, compliance and measurement of the criteria applicable to the financial product. Financial products falling under the sustainable and transition category that pursu e an environmental objective should disclose whether and the extent to which they use the EU Taxonomy as one of their investment approaches, to meet the 70% requirement. This disclosure requirement on the use of the EU Taxonomy will enhance comparability across financial products with environmental objectives. In addition, disclosures on any ESG ratings included in market documentations of sustainability-related products should be included in websites disclosures, as per requirements under Regulation (EU) 2024/3005.These disclosures should allow end-investors to understand the specific characteristics of each sustainability-related financial products, compare them and understand whether they fit their sustainability preferences, and facilitate the provision of financial and insurance advice.\n\n(22)There are currently no comprehensive metrics for gauging the sustainability of general-purpose sovereign, sub-sovereign and supranational debt issuances.I nvestments in such debt issuances should therefore be excluded from counting toward s the contribution of financial products to sustainability or transition related objective s. W ithout affecting the treatment or inclusion of those debt issuances among investments by financial products in general, investments in such debt issuances should be excluded from qualifying for the numerator of the portion of investment that needs to be reached by financial products that are categorised under the sustainable and transition categories. However, financial market participants should be allowed to includ e th ose debt issuance s in the numerator of financial products that are categorised under the ESG basics category, using available methodologies that are appropriate to assess the sustainability of those investments for th at purpose.Further, the exclusions regarding investments which financial products that are categorised as sustainability-related financial products cannot make,apply to companies, and not to sovereigns, sub-sovereigns and supra-nationals. Those exclusions therefore do not restrict investments in debt issuances by sovereigns, sub-sovereigns and supra-nationals, which can thus feature in the denominator of those financial products, including notably debt issuances by Union Member States, Union-level bodies and other public sector bodies not subject to any applicable Union-level financial sanctions. In contrast, investments in financial instruments issued by sovereigns, sub-sovereigns and supra-nationals, where the use of proceeds is known, where th o se instruments support specific sustainability aims, and provided that those financial instruments do not directly or indirectly fund activities that are excluded from investments by financial products that are categorised as sustainability-related financial products,can be included in the numerator of all categorised financial products. This balanced approach should allow sustainability-related financial products to continue to fund public projects and activities related to sustainability, while providing safeguards to potential greenwashing risks. Financial market participants should ensure that investments in public sector debt by categorised financial products are consistent with the stated sustainability-related objective or strategy o f those products to avoid greenwashing risks and be aligned with end-investors\u2019 expectations.\n\n(23)T he creation of categories for sustainability-related financial products requires provisions that determine how products that are exposed to categorised products should assess their eligibility to a category and if they do not qualify for a category, how such non-categorised financial products which invest in categorised financial products should disclose information about those investments. In order to assess the eligibility to a category, financial market participants should be able to rely on the information disclosed regarding categorised financial products and combine it with the information on their other investment s. In cases where a financial market participant uses the services of an entity regulated to provide portfolio management services, the financial market participant should be able to rely on the information provided by this entity which can be mandated to invest in accordance wit h the criteria for categorised products by its client. In case where investments of those products in categorised products reach the 70% threshold for their portfolio, and where compliance with other criteria, notably exclusion criteria, is also ensured, these products could be considered to qualify as categorised products themselves. This assessment should build on information on the underlying categorised products (e.g. either the minimum investment required for categorised products under this Regulation, or the actual investment if available) and information disclosed by portfolio managers. Provided the appropriate exclusions are met in each case, only products that meet the 70% threshold by investing solely in sustainable products could be considered sustainable, while those investing across categories would fall either within the transition (if mixing sustainable or transition products) or ESG basics (if mixing products from any of the three).For financial products that do not qualify for a category but invest in categorised financial products, in order t o ensure comparability, disclosure s should include how much th ese financial products have invest ed in financial products that are categorised as sustainability-related financial products,as well as in portfolios managed for clients on a discreti onary basis in accordance with the criteria for categorised products, and how much in non-categorised products.For this purpose, financial market participants should be able to rely on the information disclosed regarding categorised financial products as well as the information disclosed by the authorised entity in change or providing the service of portfolio management.Th at should help financial market participants managing, manufacturing or making available such products inform their clients on the sustainability-related elements of these products in a more harmonised way, while allowing them to rely on the information provided for the underlying categorised products and without requiring them to separately verify th is information.Those non-categorised products should however not be able to use sustainability-related terms in their names, that are reserved for categorised products, but should be able to include sustainability-related claims in the ir marketing communications, provided they are clear, fair and not misleading, and accurately reflect the information they disclose on the relative shares of investments in categorised products and in other assets.\n\n(24)T he wide range of potential investable assets for financial products that can be categorised as sustainability-related financial products means that t here will continue to be certain data gaps in relation to sustainability data from investees and other assets.It is th erefore appropriate to formalise and improve transparency about the use of estimates by financial market participants, without however imposing new requirements on third party sustainability data providers. Notably, proportionate steps should be introduced whereby financial market participants are to document their use of data sources and their use of external and in-house estimates and are to provide their clients with information on such use upon request.\n\n(25)T o help promote the functioning of the single market for sustainability-related financial products, as part of deeper and more integrated financial markets to mobilise savings and investments across the Union in support of competitiveness, environmental and social objectives, Member States and national competent authorities should not set or apply additional requirements as regards the consideration and disclosures of sustainability risks, or as regards the criteria, procedures, and disclosures concerning the categorisation of sustainability-related financial products.\n\n(26)Where existing financial products are closed to new investors and would no longer be offered to investors after the date of application of this Regulation, for reasons of proportionality f inancial market participants should be able opt out of applying this Regulation to those financial products.\n\n(27)T he power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission to allow for the specification of the conditions for investments to contribute to given transition-related or sustainability-related objectives or to integrate sustainability factors for the categorisation of financial products as sustainability-related products, and disclosure templates for such financial products. It is of particular importance that the Commission carr ies out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including with the European Supervisory Authorities established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council[79](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote80), Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council[80](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote81), and Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council[81](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote82),and with the Member States Expert Group on sustainable finance, where appropriate.The European Supervisory Authorities should also support the Commission in conducting appropriate testing of consumers and investors to inform how product distributors best identify the products that match clients\u2019 sustainability preferences under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565, C ommission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593, Commission Delegated Regulations (EU) 2017/2358 and (EU) 2017/2359, based on the categorisation, and ensure that associated investor-facing details are easily understandable in all official languages of the Union.T hose consultations should be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making[82](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote83). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council should receive all documents at the same time as Member States\u2019 experts, and their experts should systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n\n(28)In order to ensure unform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 as amended by this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council[83](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote84)\n\n(29)The amendments to Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 should be reflected in Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council [84](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote85). Notably, the k ey i nformation document accompanying products categorised under Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, as amended, should contain information on the category, a description of its objective, and relevant indicators.\n\n(30)This Regulation adapts i nformation requirements related to the degree to which financial products invest in sustainability-related activities, including activities that contribute to an environmental objective as set out in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, in light of the revised scope and subject matter. Given that the definition of the term \u2018sustainable investment\u2019 should be deleted and given the changes introduced by this Regulation to the disclosure requirements, the detailed disclosure requirements laid down in Articles 5 to 7 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 become moot.\n\n(31)To monitor the implementation of this Regulation and to monitor and possibly cater for market evolution and innovation, the European Supervisory Authorities should take stock of the market for sustainability-related financial products and deliver a report to the Commission on best practices every two years. This would allow for both encouraging best practices and monitor the need for any adjustment for the underlying criteria of the sustainability categories.\n\n(32)Financial market participants shall start applying this Regulation 12 months after the date of application of this Regulation for IBIP s, pension products, pension schemes and PEPP s. These products are not subject to the ESMA guidelines on funds names and therefore will require more time to implement the new underlying criteria, especially to implement the exclusions.\n\n(33)Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to strengthen protection for end investors and improve disclosures to them, including in cases of cross\u2010border purchases by end investors, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the need to lay down uniform disclosure requirements, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n\n(34)Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 and Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 should therefore be amended accordingly,\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\nArticle 1\n\nAmendments to Regulation (EU) 2019/2088\n\nRegulation (EU) 2019/2088 is amended as follows:\n\n(1)Article 1 is replaced by the following:\n\n\u2018Article 1\n\nSubject matter\n\nThis Regulation lays down harmonised rules for financial market participants on:\n\n(a)transparency with regard to the provision of sustainability-related information, including the integration of sustainability risks with respect to the investment decision-making process of those financial market participants and the financial products they offer to investors;\n\n(b)the categorisation of, and transparency with regard to,financial products as sustainability-related financial products.\u2019;\n\n(2)Article 2 is amended as follows:\n\n(a)point (1) is amended as follows:\n\n(i)point (b)is deleted;\n\n(ii)point (j) is deleted;\n\n(b)points (5) and(6) are deleted;\n\n(c)p oint(11) is deleted;\n\n(d)in point (12), point (a) is deleted;\n\n(e)points (16) and(17)are deleted;\n\n(f)points(20) and (21) are deleted;\n\n(g)the following point s(2 5) to(28) are added:\n\n\u2018(25)'sustainability-related financial product\u2019 means a financial product that is categorised in accordance with Article 7, 8 or 9;\n\n(26)\u2018sustainability-related financial product with impact\u2019 means a financial product categorised in accordance with Article 7 or 9 that has as its objective t he generat ion of a pre-defined, positive and measurable social or environmental impact;\n\n(27)'public sector bodies\u2019 means central governments or central banks, regional governments or local authorities, multilateral development banks as referred to in Article 117 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council*1, and international organisations as referred to in Article 118 of that Regulation;

Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector\n\n1.2.Policy area(s) concerned\n\nSavings and Investments Union, European Green Deal, Sustainable Finance Strategy\n\n1.3.Objective(s)\n\n1.3.1.General objective(s)\n\nThe first general objective is to protect the integrity of the EU single market for sustainable finance by ensuring requirements which mitigate risks of greenwashing, and to better help investors seize opportunities in sustainability-linked financial products. The second general objective is to boost the competitiveness of Europe\u2019s financial sector by ensuring conditions which make business easier and help to deepen the single market for sustainability-linked financial products and thus to efficiently allocate capital for Europe\u2019s sustainable prosperity. Overall, this is set to ensure a better use of the potential of the European single market for sustainable finance to contribute to funding the transition towards Europe\u2019s sustainable prosperity and competitiveness.\n\n1.3.2.Specific objective(s)\n\nSpecific objectives\n\nThe first specific objective is to simplify and reduce the sustainability-related administrative requirements of the SFDR for financial market participants, as well as to enhance the coherence of the framework for their operational needs. The second specific objective is to improve end-investors\u2019 ability to understand and compare sustainability-linked financial products. The specific objectives tackle the main problems which have been identified both for financial market participants on the one hand, and for investors on the other, which inhibit their ability to, respectively, design financial products and deploy corresponding investments in an efficient and effective manner toward the EU\u2019s sustainability, competitiveness and other strategic policy goals.\n\n1.3.3.Expected result(s) and impact\n\nSpecify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.\n\nFinancial market participants and investors with an interest in sustainable investing are expected to benefit from a simple categorisation for all products with environmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives and features, with a common set of rules regarding ESG claims in names, marketing communication and in the distribution of such products. The categories would effectively cluster ESG financial products into three groupings depending on their objectives and levels of ambition. End-investors would be better able to grasp whether a financial product is focused on contributing to a sustainability objective/made largely of sustainable assets, focused on helping companies to transition toward more sustainable practices, or integrating broader or lighter ESG strategies. The underlying criteria of the categories would ensure harmonised minimum ESG performance, notably against risks deemed unacceptable by the majority of sustainability-minded investors, thereby increasing investors\u2019 protection against greenwashing risks. The regulation would be clearer and simpler to apply than today, with lower costs and risks of national gold plating. The initial one-off costs would be offset by overall burden reductions expected to reduce recurring costs over the medium to longer term. Overall, the impacts are expected to boost the integrity and scale of the EU single market for sustainable finance and encourage the efficient allocation of capital in line with the objectives of the savings and investments union.\n\n1.3.4.Indicators of performance\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.\n\nTo monitor progress towards meeting the specific and general objectives, the Commission would work together with established processes underway notably with the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) and the Platform for Sustainable Finance (PSF) to analyse:\n\nThe costs incurred by the industry \u2013 Supervisory authorities could survey and assess the implementation costs linked to the new categorisation system at the latest 3 years after its implementation. This assessment could also monitor the cost reductions from the reduced disclosures.\n\nPossible occurrences of greenwashing in EU markets. \u2013 Building on existing processes, supervisory authorities could regularly continue to monitor occurrences of greenwashing, continue to oversee sustainability-related claims by products, and periodically survey investors to help assess the effectiveness of the revised SFDR as a tool against greenwashing and ensuring decision-relevant data for investors.\n\nCapital flows to sustainable investment \u2013 Building on the work of the Platform for Sustainable Finance to monitor capital flows to sustainable investment, a targeted analysis a few years after the implementation of the regime could be carried out to assess the degree to which the categorisation system, together with the simplified disclosures, has helped boost financing toward sustainable economic activities and projects and helped lower the cost of capital linked to these.\n\n1.4.The proposal/initiative relates to:\n\n\uf0a8a new action\n\n\uf0a8a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action[85](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote86)\n\n\uf0a8the extension of an existing action\n\n\uf0fea merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative\n\nOnce agreed by co-legislators, an implementation and preparatory period would precede the entry into application of the revised SFDR framework. The transition to the new rules would be facilitated by the fact that the proposals build on existing market practices and regulatory guidance to a large degree, and allow for a further phasing-in period for financial products which are not subject to this guidance.\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.\n\nThe need for a coherent common framework for sustainability-related disclosures for financial products across the EU was established as part of the original SFDR. The objectives remain fully valid, and enjoy broad stakeholder support. Without Union-level action to review the current regime, the challenges identified with it would persist in the shape of undue complexity and a lack of clarity regarding the sustainability-linked features of available financial products, negatively impacting their credibility and uptake.\n\nTo overcome these problems and boost the effectiveness and efficiency of the single market for sustainable finance products, the necessary simplification and adjustment of the existing SFDR framework can only be done in a coherent and effective way at EU level. Actions by Member States could, in contrast, only address some of the identified issues, but with the risk of fragmentation of the single market (diverging levels of transparency between national markets, growing disparities in investor confidence in ESG products across Member States, risks of more barriers and challenges for cross-border market participants, and further limits to the comparability of products across the single market).\n\nAction at EU level to ensure uniform simplifications and a common set-up for the ESG-features of financial products, together with solutions to ESG data-related challenges, is more conducive to a harmonised, effective, efficient and coherent outcome across the single market, and in support of the broader strategic objectives of the Union. In short, EU level action would boost the proper functioning of the single market for sustainable finance and in addition contribute to improving transparency for investors across the Union to enable their participation in EU capital markets in general, in line with the objectives of the Savings and Investments Union.\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\nThe lessons learned from some of the challenges with the existing rules can be summarised as the need to (i) ensure a coherent implementation timeline for the updated changes, (ii) introduce clearer, simpler and more proportionate rules and concepts for the benefit of financial market participants and investors, (iii) formalise and embedding these in a framework of product categories, to help cluster available products in this way, and (iv) ensure that the revised concepts, rules and possible categories rely on ESG data that is available and/or possible to reliably estimate.\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments\n\nThe review serves the objective of helping to mobilise funds toward the competitive opportunities in the green transition and other evolving strategic priorities in line with Union objectives. As such, it can ease the pressure off public funds, which are increasingly stretched in terms of competing and new emerging priorities, to finance and catalyse funds towards sustainability objectives. Specific co-investments into relevant EU financial programmes are also encouraged under the criteria for the product categories.\n\n1.5.5.Assessment of the different available financing options,

revised SFDR will support the general objectives of the European Data Strategy as it aims to ensure that data collection and reporting requirements regarding the sustainability features of financial products will be significantly simplified compared to the existing framework. In contrast to the wider scope in terms of products, and greater number of datapoints (and services) covered at present, the future rules would hinge on fewer datapoints for products which integrate or embrace ESG features in their design. In order to collect the relevant data, financial market participants\u2019 reliance on digital data collection, processing and vending platforms and their own deployment of in-house digital data management tools would be streamlined. For investors and their own deployment of digital search and comparison tools, disclosures would be more focused on the most meaningful datapoints, facilitating accessibility (and comparability) of key data. Both for financial market participants (preparers of product-data) and investors (users of product-data), the use of artificial intelligence tools, in accordance with the requirements and risk parameters of the AI Act, would be facilitated. To streamline data collection and processing, the changes are commensurate with those introduced under the \u2018Omnibus I\u2019 simplifications for sustainability data from corporates. In addition, the digital tagging of SFDR data at entity-level introduced under Article 18a of the Regulation for the purposes of the creation of a European single access point (ESAP) to help the publication of machine-readable information for investors is adjusted accordingly.\n\nAlignment with the once-only principle\n\nThe data required for defined specific purposes for categorised sustainability-related financial products under the revised SFDR will be largely reusable between them (i.e. pre-contractual and periodic disclosures for financial market participants\u2019 websites). The data required will principally hinge on ensuring: (a) measurable indicators to demonstrate that a sufficient portion of financial products\u2019 investments are aligned with their stated sustainability objectives or attributes and (b) compliance with a set of mostly binary exclusions regarding sectors and activities which the products cannot invest in. The data choices for the first would largely depend on financial market participants\u2019 design of their products, and those for the second would largely constitute a straightforward explanation to demonstrate that they do not invest in excluded activities. The revised rules also formalise and set out transparency requirements for the use of estimates for the purposes of, mostly, the first requirement, as well as reliance on external data providers. The simplified data flows facilitate it to be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, and to meet high-quality standards.\n\nData flows\n\nType of data Reference(s) to the requirement Actor who provides the data Actor who receives the data Trigger for the data exchange Frequency (if applicable)\nData on sustainability risks for entities/products Articles 3 and 6 Financial market participants Investors, general public When updating information/when making available financial products\nData on sustainability factors for non-categorised products Article 6a Financial market participants Investors, general public When making available financial products\nData on compliance with the criteria for categorised sustainability-related financial products Articles 7(3), 8(3) and 9(3); Article 10; Article 11(2)Financial market participants Investors, general public When making available financial products\nData on products combining categorised financial products Article 9a Financial market participants Investors, general public When making available financial products\nData on sources and estimates used for ascertaining compliance with the criteria for categorised products Article 12a Financial market participants Investors Request from investor\nData submitted to European single access point Article 18a Financial market participants Investors, general public Publication by FMP\n\n4.3.Digital solutions\n\nN/A, beyond adjusted requirement to submit relevant data to the European single access point, already established in existing framework.\n\n4.4.Interoperability assessment\n\nN/A, beyond adjusted requirement to submit relevant data to the European single access point, already established in existing framework.\n\n4.5.Measures to support digital implementation\n\nIn general, d ata requirements under the revised SFDR are supported by the measures foreseen to support digital availability of corporate sustainabil ity information under Directive 2103/34/EU and Regulation (EU) 2020/852[86](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0841#footnote87).

These include all chapters under cluster 1 on the fundamentals and under cluster 4 on the green agenda and sustainable connectivity. Two chapters have provisionally been closed. The Commission\u2019s recommendations from previous years remain valid, that Serbia has fulfilled the opening benchmarks for cluster 3 (competitiveness and inclusive growth) and that this cluster is technically ready to open. The overall pace of negotiations will continue to depend on the rule of law reforms and the normalisation of Serbia\u2019s relations with Kosovo*.\n\nThe Serbian government has continued to declare EU membership its strategic goal, and it set a new, more ambitious target date of the end of 2026 to meet technical criteria for membership. Meeting Serbia\u2019s objectives for EU accession negotiations requires strong political will, a whole-of-society approach, effective policy planning and coordination, along with sufficient human and financial resources for EU accession across all institutions involved. There is an anti-EU narrative evident not only in Serbian media outlets but also used by political office holders, including at highest levels. As a matter of priority, the Serbian authorities still need to take much more responsibility for proactive and more objective communication on Serbia\u2019s EU accession process and the EU and for countering disinformation and information manipulation.\n\nOn 1 November 2024, the fall of a canopy at the Novi Sad railway station caused the death of 16 people. This tragic event prompted mass nation-wide student and citizen protests and blockades across the country over corruption and the perceived lack of accountability and transparency at government level with reports of excessive use of force against protesters. The incident and the aftermath has further deepened the polarisation in Serbian society. The protests continue to take place.\n\nIn the reporting period, the EU-facilitated Dialogue on normalisation of relations between Serbia and Kosovo continued. Domestic political preoccupations on both sides have hindered decisive steps towards implementing the 2023 Agreement on the Path to Normalisation and its implementation annex and thereby progressing on normalising their relations. Constructive engagement in the normalisation is also a requirement under the Reform and Growth Facility for the Western Balkans.\n\nSerbia has actively engaged in and started to deliver on the implementation of the new Growth Plan for the Western Balkans across all four pillars of gradual integration with the EU: single market, regional economic integration, fundamental reforms and increased financial support. Under the Reform and Growth Facility, a performance-based EU instrument that supports the EU accession process, the country adopted its Reform Agenda. The Reform Agenda covers reforms in the areas of: (i) business environment and private-sector development; (ii) green and digital transition; (iii) human capital; (iv) fundamental rights and the rule of law.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s 2025 rule of law report[2](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025SC0755#footnote3) covered Serbia for the second time.\n\n1.2 Main findings of the reports\n\nCluster 1: The Fundamentals of the Accession Process\n\nDemocracy\n\nTangible improvements and further reforms are needed in the conduct of elections. It is vital that all outstanding recommendations by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE/ODIHR) and the Council of Europe bodies are fully implemented, in a transparent and inclusive process and well ahead of any new elections.\n\nParliament\u2019s effectiveness and oversight function remain hampered by the low frequency of sessions and the lack of genuine political debate. Public scrutiny and involvement in the legislative process were limited and debates continued to be marked by tensions between the ruling coalition and the opposition. Parliamentary rules of procedure and the Code of Conduct to penalise offences by parliamentarians need to be consistently applied.\n\nThe institutions in charge of the EU integration process are in place. The government has advanced its strategic objective to meet all EU criteria by the end of 2026 but is yet to show genuine political will to deliver on EU-related priorities and speed up the preparations accordingly. The current deep societal polarisation, as well as persistent anti-EU rhetoric, run counter to this objective. The authorities have yet to achieve more proactive and objective communication about the EU and Serbia\u2019s accession process. The increasingly difficult environment for civil society has led to the decision by civil society organisations to suspend cooperation with the authorities. This has in turn affected the inclusiveness of the EU integration process.\n\nThe government was in a caretaker capacity between 19 March (when Parliament took note of the Prime Minister\u2019s resignation) and 16 April 2025, when a new government was appointed. The reform of the local government system continued to advance slowly.\n\nCivil society organisations (CSOs) in Serbia operate in an increasingly difficult environment. Since the start of the protests, CSOs advocating for the rule of law have faced intensified verbal attacks and smear campaigns, including by high-level officials. Complaints were filed against t he use of spyware targeting human rights defenders and journalists. Strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs) increasingly hindered CSOs\u2019 work. Several foreign CSO representatives, including from EU Member States, were expelled from Serbia and some were subsequently banned from entering the country. In February 2025, the police searched the offices of four CSOs at the request of the Special Anti-Corruption Department of the Higher Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office in Belgrade. To date, the searches have not resulted in any judicial proceedings and they have been widely perceived as an act of pressure on civil society. Cooperation between the government and CSOs has been under strain. There is still significant scope to improve the transparency of public funding to civil society.\n\nPublic administration reform\n\nSerbia is moderately prepared in the area of public administration reform and overall there has been no progress during the reporting period.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were not implemented and therefore remain valid. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aereduce the excessive number of acting positions and allocate sufficient resources to run effective, merit-based recruitment processes;\n\n\u00aestrengthen the mechanism for systematically integrating opinions issued by the Public Policy Secretariat into draft laws and policy documents, in line with the Law on the planning system;\n\n\u00aeput in place a unified, comprehensive and transparent system for capital investment planning and management, in line with the Reform Agenda.\n\nChapter 23: Judiciary and fundamental rights\n\nSerbia has reached some level of preparation and has made no progress.\n\nFunctioning of the judiciary\n\nSerbia is between having some and a moderate level of preparation in the area of judiciary. No progress was made overall during the reporting the period. Whilst the case management system for prosecutor offices was finalised, Serbia still lacks a comprehensive court case management system. Several judges and prosecutors were elected in 2024 and 2025, but a considerable number of vacancies remain to be filled. Undue pressure on the judiciary remains a concern, with little or no follow-up from relevant institutions, and there are concerns about prosecutorial autonomy. Four vacant positions at the Constitutional Court still need to be filled. S erbia has yet to show a genuine commitment to investigating and adjudicating war crimes cases, including by appointing a Chief Public Prosecutor for War Crimes.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were implemented to a limited extent and therefore remain largely valid. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aeadopt the Law on the Judicial Academy in line with the Venice Commission recommendations and carry out the appointments of judges and prosecutors in line with the legal framework, in particular to fill the vacant positions in the Constitutional Court;\n\n\u00aereduce political interference in the judiciary and prosecution services and ensure that the High Judicial Council and the High Prosecutorial Council, the government and Parliament defend judicial independence and prosecutorial autonomy effectively and proactively in cases of undue influence;\n\n\u00aemake the uniform and centralised case management systems operational; improve the efficiency of the justice system, in particular by reducing the backlogs and disposition times for the Administrative and Constitutional Courts and fully implement the human resources and ICT strategies.\n\nFight against corruption\n\nSerbia is between having some and a moderate level of preparation in the fight against corruption. Overall, it has made limited progress. In December 2024, Serbia adopted an action plan for the national anti-corruption strategy for 2024-2025. Overall, corruption is prevalent in many areas and remains an issue of concern. The canopy collapse at Novi Sad railway station prompted widespread public protests over corruption and the perceived lack of accountability and transparency in government infrastructure and construction projects. The authorities launched investigations into alleged corruption linked to the tragic incident, which have yet to be completed. There is a need for stronger political will to tackle corruption effectively, establish a robust track record and put in place a robust criminal justice response, including action on high-level corruption. The role and mandate of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office for Organised Crime is insufficiently regulated in the law. Targeted risk assessments and specific measures are also needed to tackle corruption in the most vulnerable sectors.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were implemented only to a limited extent and therefore remain largely valid. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aefurther improve its track record on investigations, prosecutions and final court decisions in high-level corruption cases, in particular the seizure and confiscation of criminal assets and ensuring the systematic use of parallel financial investigations; strengthen the mandate of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office for Organised Crime to increase its effectiveness;\n\n\u00aeaddress all GRECO recommendations, in particular from the fifth evaluation round; establish a constructive relationship with the Anti-Corruption Council and systematically consult the Council on draft legislation;\n\n\u00aeimplement the anti-corruption action plan (2024-2025) accompanying the anti-corruption strategy as well as adopt and start implementing the action plan for 2026-2028, including by establishing an effective monitoring, evaluation and coordination mechanism to track progress and impact, while focusing on all relevant interim benchmarks and GRECO recommendations.\n\nFundamental rights\n\nWhile Serbia\u2019s legislative and institutional framework for upholding fundamental rights is broadly in place, implementation of this framework needs to be improved as a matter of priority. Independent bodies have issued only little, or late, public reaction to human rights violations in the context of the protests. While freedom of assembly was generally ensured and protests allowed to take place, the safety of participants was not always guaranteed, and several violent incidents against demonstrators and journalists occurred, with reported cases of excessive use of force by the police. To date, only some perpetrators have been prosecuted, while several others were pardoned from criminal prosecution by the President. Such incidents intensified over the summer. The European Court of Human Rights issued an interim measure on the alleged use by the authorities of a sonic weapon for crowd control at demonstrations in Belgrade; there was no credible follow-up yet by the authorities which denied such use.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were not implemented and therefore remain valid. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aeensure people can effectively exercise their right to freedom of assembly and strengthen the resources of human rights institutions, ensuring they exercise their mandates to the full and put in place procedures to ensure compliance with the decisions issued by the European Court of Human Rights, including interim measures;\n\n\u00aeadopt and allocate sufficient resources to implement the pending strategies or action plans on violence against women, deinstitutionalisation, anti-discrimination \u2013 including the rights of LGBTIQ persons \u2013 and violence against children; actively counter hate crimes and build up a track record of investigations and convictions;\n\n\u00aeadopt the pending action plan on national minorities and demonstrate, through better data collection, real improvements in the effective exercise of the rights of individuals belonging to national minorities, including reference to the targets set by the Poznan Declaration on Roma[3](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025SC0755#footnote4) inclusion.\n\nFreedom of expression\n\nSerbia has some level of preparation in the area of freedom of expression. Although Serbia amended its media legislation to align further with the EU acquis and European standards, there was backsliding during the reporting period as the environment for journalists, media professionals and outlets seriously worsened. Recurrent statements by high-level officials on the work of journalists have a chilling effect on the freedom of expression. Cases of strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs) increasingly hindered the work of investigative media. The media laws of 2023 have also been inconsistently implemented. In particular, the media regulator, REM, failed to fully exercise its mandate and serious concerns persisted regarding its independence in practice. The Parliament did not elect a new REM Council by the legal deadline of 4 November 2024 and, as a result, Serbia has been without the decision-making body of the media regulator since then. However, the process of selection has recently advanced with international facilitation. Political and economic influence on the media, including on editorial policy, is a source of serious concern.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were implemented to a limited extent and therefore remain valid. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aeimplement the new media laws in a way that respects both their letter and spirit, including on the independence of the media regulator, and amend the laws to align with the European Media Freedom Act and related European standards and in line with its adopted media strategy;\n\n\u00aestrengthen the protection and safety of journalists, notably by ensuring that: (i) high-level officials stop verbal attacks on journalists involving intimidation, stigmatisation and de-legitimisation; and (ii) swiftly follow up any threats or cases of physical and verbal violence and publicly condemn, investigate or prosecute any such cases, as appropriate;\n\n\u00aeensure transparent and equitable co-funding for media content serving the public interest, and full transparency in media ownership and advertising.\n\nChapter 24: Justice, freedom and security\n\nSerbia is between having some and a moderate level of preparation in the field of justice, freedom and security and has made limited progress. Serbia continued to contribute to the management of mixed migration flows to the EU by playing an active and constructive role and by cooperating effectively with its neighbours, EU Member States and EU agencies. The EU-Serbia status agreement entered into force on 1 April 2025. Serbia took steps to align with the EU visa policy by reinstating visa requirements for nationals of Kuwait, Mongolia, Oman and Qatar in December 2024. However, Serbia\u2019s visa policy is still only partially in line with the EU list of visa-required third countries. The acquisition of visa-free travel rights to the EU for nationals of Russia by granting them Serbian citizenship poses potential security risks for the EU.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were partially implemented. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aeamend the Law on internal affairs to make the police fully autonomous from the Ministry of Interior and fully accountable only to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office during pre-investigation and investigation phases;\n\n\u00aefurther align with the EU\u2019s visa policy and ensure a rigorous screening of visa-free arrivals of third-country nationals, particularly from countries presenting security or irregular migration risks; apply rigorous security screening when granting Serbian citizenship to third-country nationals, since Serbian passport holders benefit from visa free travel to the EU; take measures to systematically register and identify migrants, develop swift asylum procedures and increase the capacity to manage effective return operations; ensure that legal pathways developed for third country nationals entering Serbia prevent secondary movements to the EU;\n\n\u00aeadopt new strategies and action plans to combat cybercrime, small arms and light weapons control, and drugs.\n\nFight against serious and organised crime\n\nSerbia has some level of preparation and has made limited progress. Authorities continued to cooperate actively with the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL), Eurojust, Europol and Interpol, notably on drugs trafficking and the fight against organised crime groups.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were not implemented and therefore remain valid. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aeimprove the efficiency of prosecuting serious and organised crime cases, including money laundering cases and the seizure and confiscation of criminal assets by the systematic tracking of money flows, the effective use of financial investigations and special investigative measures, and the systemic use of extended confiscation;\n\n\u00aeamend the Criminal Code to effectively criminalise the trafficking of weapons, adopt the new Law on weapons and ammunition and step up the fight against the storage, sale and ownership of illegal firearms; adopt the Law on trafficking in human beings;\n\n\u00aetake specific steps to ensure a clear separation between mandates and regulations concerning criminal investigations carried out by law enforcement institutions and security measures executed by the Security Information Agency (BIA).\n\nEconomic criteria\n\nThe existence of a functioning market economy\n\nSerbia has a good level of preparation and has made limited progress in developing a functioning market economy.\n\nIn 2024, economic activity was robust, but slowed markedly in the first half of 2025 while external imbalances increased. The budget deficit turned out lower than planned in 2024 and monetary policy remained relatively tight, which helped inflation return to the target band. The banking sector remained stable, and the labour market improved further. Serbia postponed the full application of some fiscal rules and the reform of the public sector wage system faced further delays. State aid rules are not always implemented due to strong political pressure to provide financial assistance to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and large foreign investors. SOEs continue to have an outsized presence in many structurally important sectors. The business environment is hampered by red tape, weaknesses in the rule of law and limited efficiency and transparency of the public administration. The government has interfered significantly in the goods market by instituting on a very short notice a 20% margin cap for a wide variety of goods from 1 September 2025 for the following 6 months. While it is intended to benefit consumers through lower inflation, the measure risks causing market distortions and having a negative impact on investment.\n\nLast year\u2019s recommendations were implemented to a limited extent and therefore remain largely valid. To improve the functioning of the market economy, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aekeep an appropriately tight policy stance to maintain price stability, including by containing current spending;\n\n\u00aeswiftly advance the reform of the public sector wage system;\n\n\u00aeadopt implementing legislation to fully implement the SOE law and strengthen SOE governance to reduce the associated fiscal risks.\n\nThe capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union\n\nSerbia is between a moderate and a good level of preparation and has made some progress in coping with competitive pressure and market forces in the EU. The manufacturing and service sectors are well-developed, benefiting from close economic integration with the EU. Serbia has made some progress in facilitating the school-to-work transition. Educational outcomes are below the OECD average and public spending on education and research remains below the EU average. There are wide infrastructure gaps, especially in certain sectors, despite higher government investment. Digital transformation is well advanced. SMEs still face obstacles, including an uneven playing field compared with large companies and foreign investors.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year have been partially implemented. Over the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aeimprove education outcomes and skills, including by increasing enrolment rates, modernising vocational education and training, and stepping up lifelong learning;\n\n\u00aefurther strengthen public investment management, including by putting in place a single, comprehensive and transparent system for prioritising and selecting all public investments, regardless of the type and source of financing and in line with the best international standards;\n\n\u00aefurther advance green transition reforms, connectivity and diversify sources of energy imports.\n\nChapter 5: Public procurement\n\nSerbia is moderately prepared in the area of public procurement. It made limited progress by increasing the use of green and social procurement, as well as the price and quality criterion for contract award.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were implemented to a limited extent and remain largely valid. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aefurther align its legislation with the 2014 EU directives on public procurement, in particular by amending the Law on public-private partnerships and concessions and by ensuring that projects are subject to public procurement procedures;\n\n\u00aeensure that procurement rules under intergovernmental agreements with third countries comply with the public procurement principles, in line with the EU acquis;\n\n\nChapter 18 - Statistics\n\nSerbia is between a moderate and a good level of preparation in the area of statistics. Some progress was made during the reporting period with continued improvements in the compilation of macroeconomic statistics, in line with the European System of Accounts (ESA 2010).\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were partially implemented. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aeadopt a new statistical law to increase the statistical office\u2019s professional independence, while taking into account the revised Regulation (EC) No 223/2009;\n\n\u00aecontinue to improve the compilation of macroeconomic statistics in line with the European System of Accounts (ESA 2010).\n\nChapter 32: Financial control\n\nSerbia is moderately prepared in the area of financial control. Limited progress was made in the reporting period, notably by adopting the managerial accountability roadmap.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were partially implemented. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aeensure the public internal financial control (PIFC) legal basis is fully consistent with the general legal framework;\n\n\u00aecreate an effective internal audit function in all central budget institutions;\n\n\u00aeimplement the managerial accountability roadmap swiftly and effectively.\n\nCluster 2: Internal market\n\nChapter 1: Free movement of goods\n\nSerbia is moderately prepared in the area of free movement of goods. Limited progress was made during the reporting period with the revision of the strategic documents under this chapter in accordance with Commission\u2019s assessment.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were implemented to a limited extent and remain valid. In the coming year Serbia should, in particular:\n\n\u00aeensure timely implementation of the strategic documents ensuring compliance with Articles 34-36 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and all the EU acquis in this chapter;\n\n\u00aealign with the latest EU acquis on market surveillance and on machinery.\n\nChapter 2 - Freedom of movement for workers\n\nSerbia is moderately prepared in the freedom of movement for workers. Serbia made limited progress by simplifying the issuance of work and residence permits for foreigners and by continuing to improve electronic data exchange with Member States.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were implemented to a limited extent and therefore remain largely valid. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aecontinue to work on concluding additional agreements on social security coordination with EU Member States and develop IT infrastructures for the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) and Electronic Exchange of Social Security Information (EESSI) purposes, as well as administrative capacities in view of joining the future EESSI Network;\n\n\u00aestart preparations to join the European Labour Authority;\n\n\u00aestart preparing for the alignment of national legislation with the EU acquis on free movement of workers \u2013 on access for EU citizens to the labour market and on equal treatment of EU citizens with nationals in the labour market.\n\nChapter 3: Right of establishment and freedom to provide services\n\nSerbia is moderately prepared in these areas. Some progress was made, in particular following the adoption of the horizontal Law on services and the Law on postal services, which achieve further alignment with the EU acquis.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were partially implemented. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aefurther align its horizontal law on services with the EU Services Directive, advance harmonisation of sectoral laws with the horizontal law and the EU acquis, and create a portal for the point of single contact providing online information for service providers, including all relevant administrative procedures;\n\n\u00aefinalise alignment with the EU acquis on postal services and implement the postal market rules;\n\n\u00aecontinue aligning with the EU acquis on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, including the directives on the recognition of professional qualifications and on a proportionality test.\n\nChapter 4: Free movement of capital\n\nSerbia is between a moderate and a good level of preparation on the free movement of capital. Some progress was made during the reporting period, in particular with the adoption of several amendments to the legal framework on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CFT) and implementing legislation on payment services, to align further with the EU acquis.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were partially implemented. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aeliberalise capital movements in line with its obligations under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), including by removing the remaining restrictions on the acquisition of agricultural land by EU nationals and by adopting amendments to the Law on the elements of property law relations to ensure equal treatment on the acquisition of property rights;\n\n\u00aedemonstrate greater effectiveness in monitoring, supervision, financial intelligence, investigation and reporting by building a track record of action in the field of AML/CFT.\n\nChapter 6: Company law\n\nSerbia has a good level of preparation in company law. No progress was made during the reporting period.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were not implemented and therefore remain valid. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aefurther align its legislation with the EU acquis on company law, particularly on takeover bids;\n\n\u00aealign its legislation with the EU acquis on cross-border operations (conversions, mergers and divisions) and on the use of digital tools and processes in company law;\n\n\u00aef urther align its legislation on company reporting and transparency.\n\nChapter 7: Intellectual property law\n\nSerbia has a good level of preparation in intellectual property rights (IPR). No progress was made in the reporting period.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were not implemented and therefore remain valid. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aealign the copyright and related rights legislation with the EU directives on collective rights management, on orphan works and on certain permitted uses of certain works and other subject matter protected by copyright and related rights for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print-disabled;\n\n\u00aestrengthen enforcement by improving capacities to handle IPR cases and improving coordination among different stakeholders.\n\nChapter 8: Competition policy\n\nSerbia is moderately prepared in competition policy. In 2024, Serbia made limited progress by finalising the inventory of State aid schemes.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were implemented to a limited extent, and therefore remain largely valid.

Limited progress was made in implementing consumer protection legislation, notably by adopting the law on the protection of financial service consumers which is aimed to align with the EU acquis.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were implemented to a limited extent, and therefore remain largely valid. In the coming year, Serbia should, in particular:\n\n\u00e0 further align its legislation with the EU acquis on substances of human origin, on patients\u2019 rights in cross-border healthcare, on tobacco control and on medicinal products for human and for veterinary use;\n\n\u00aeamend the Law on health records and documentation to ensure that it fully complies with EU data protection requirements and with the EU acquis;\n\n\u00aefurther align with the EU acquis on consumer protection and general product safety.\n\nCluster 3: Competitiveness and inclusive growth\n\nChapter 10: Digital transformation and media\n\nSerbia is moderately prepared in the field of digital transformation and media. Some progress was made on digitalisation, with the adoption of the media laws and the transposition of the EU 5G Cybersecurity Toolbox.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were partially implemented.

Serbia made no progress during the reporting period. Serbia needs to continue aligning its legislation with the EU acquis in the area of non-discrimination and equality, including also gender equality.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were not implemented and therefore remain valid. In the coming period, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aeaddress the recommendations made in the previous functional reviews of the national employment service to ensure sufficient financial and institutional resources for employment and social policies, to systematically focus on supporting young people, women and the long-term unemployed, and continue implementing the Youth Guarantee pilot;\n\n\u00aelaunch consultations on the new labour law, including rules on foreign seconded workers in line with the EU acquis, and a new law on strike and further capacity building for social partners, and avoid further delays in implementing the action plan for Chapter 19, including aligning further with the EU acquis in the area of non-discrimination and equality in employment and social policy;\n\n\u00aeadopt the delayed social protection strategy and amendments to the social welfare law to improve the coverage and adequacy of social benefits for people below the poverty threshold, including financial social assistance and child allowances, tackle the high caseload of social welfare centres, and address the recommendations made by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) on the decision-making process of the Social Card and its impact on Roma and other vulnerable individuals.\n\nChapter 20: Enterprise and industrial policy\n\nSerbia is moderately prepared on enterprise and industrial policy.

No progress was made in the reporting period. Although the action plan for the Smart Specialisation strategy and the strategy for the development of a start-up ecosystem continued to be implemented, this was overshadowed by negative developments affecting the autonomy of research institutes and universities.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were not implemented and therefore remain valid. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aeensure the autonomy of research institutes and universities and the respect of academic freedom and freedom of scientific research, in line with the principles of the European Research Area;\n\n\u00aeincrease its national funding for research and innovation and continue implementing the Smart Specialisation Strategy;\n\n\u00aealign its legislation with the European Research Infrastructure Consortium Regulation in line with the Reform Agenda.\n\nChapter 26: Education and culture\n\nSerbia has a good level of preparation in education and culture. No progress was made overall in the reporting period. While some positive steps were taken, in particular by further consolidating the national qualifications framework system, the delivery of quality education was impacted by the discontinuity of education throughout the 2024/2025 school year, measures worsening the working conditions of teaching staff and dismissals and non-renewals of contracts of a high number of teaching staff and principals at the start of the new school year.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were partially implemented. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aesupport children and young people, notably the most vulnerable, by bridging learning gaps during the school year 2024/2025, improve the working conditions of teaching staff and ensure respect of academic freedom, in line with the principles of the European Higher Education Area and the Bologna Follow-up Group;\n\n\u00aeincrease the number of children attending early childhood education and care, in particular children from disadvantaged backgrounds;\n\n\u00aeensure that the policy and institutional framework for quality assurance in higher education fully complies with the recommendations of the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education.\n\nChapter 29: Customs union\n\nSerbia has a good level of preparation in the area of the customs union. It made limited progress, in particular with the adoption of amendments to existing legislation, including secondary legislation, with the aim of further alignment with the EU acquis, as well as partial operationalisation of the new risk analysis IT system RMS.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were implemented to a limited extent, and therefore remain largely valid.

No progress was made during the reporting period.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were not implemented and therefore remain valid. In the coming year, Serbia, should in particular:\n\n\u00aeadopt the national transport strategy in line with the new TEN-T Regulation requirements; improve the maintenance system for road and rail infrastructure; continue with alignment and simplification of road and rail border crossing procedures, including in the context of the EU-Western Balkans Green Lanes; and implement measures in the action plan for the national road safety strategy;\n\n\u00aeensure that procurement procedures for transport infrastructure projects follow the principles of transparency, equal treatment and open competition, while also strengthening the legal, technical, administrative, and institutional frameworks associated with those projects, including the establishment of fully independent quality control mechanisms;\n\n\u00aeon rail reform, continue aligning legislation with the Fourth Railway Package and adopt the Law on Railways and the Law on Railway Safety; start addressing bottlenecks hindering the efficiency and quality of preparation and implementation of infrastructure investment projects.\n\nChapter 15: Energy\n\nSerbia is moderately prepared in the area of energy. Some progress was made on last year\u2019s recommendations. Achievements include the certification of the Transportgas company, alignment with and commencement of implementation of the Electricity Integration Package, the issuance of the usage permit for the gas interconnector between Serbia and Bulgaria, and further alignment with the EU\u2019s Renewable Energy Directive.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were partially implemented. In the coming year, Serbia should, in particular:\n\n\u2192accelerate the implementation of the Electricity Integration Package, including determining net transmission capacities and allocating capacity on all cross-border interconnections, including on the bidding zone border between Transmission System Operators (TSOs) EMS and KOSTT;\n\n\u2192complete the unbundling of Srbijagas, ensure effective, non-discriminatory, and transparent third-party access at all gas entry points, and certify the Banatski Dvor underground gas storage facility in accordance with the Gas Storage Regulation; align with and implement the Gas Storage Regulation and Gas Security of Supply regulations, including the development of a risk assessment, preventive action plan and emergency plan;\n\n\u2192finalise and adopt the implementing legislation on the energy performance of buildings and set up the Just Transition governance process in line with the adopted Just Transition action plan.\n\nChapter 21 - Trans-European networks\n\nSerbia is between a moderate and a good level of preparation in the area of trans-European networks. Overall, some progress has been made, including the commissioning and commercial operations of the Serbia-Bulgaria gas interconnector (IBS), as well as the start of works on Section III of the Trans-Balkan Electricity Corridor.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were partially implemented. In the coming year, Serbia should, in particular:\n\n\u2192 continue to improve transport and energy infrastructure connections, ensuring quality and transparency in line with EU standards; Serbia to transpose the revised TEN-E Regulation;\n\n\u2192 continue the implementation of the Section III and project preparation for section IV of the Trans-Balkan Electricity Corridor between Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro; continue project preparation for the Pannonian corridor that includes the line 400 kV Subotica-Sandorfalva;\n\n\u2192 conclude project preparations and launch the procurement process for works to modernise the railway sections on Corridor X from Belgrade to Ni\u0161; accelerate implementation of the Ni\u0161-Dimitrovgrad railway line, including the Ni\u0161 rail bypass; and complete the Ni\u0161-Brestovac railway section.\n\nChapter 27 - Environment and climate change\n\nSerbia has some level of preparation in the area of environment and climate change.

In the coming year, Serbia should, in particular:\n\n\u00aeimplement measures set out in: (i) the action plan for administrative capacity development; (ii) the low carbon development strategy; (iii) the programme on air protection; and (iv) implement extended producers\u2019 responsibility (EPR) system for specific waste streams, in accordance with the polluter pays principle;\n\n\u00aeadopt legislation in line with the Environmental Crime Directive; adopt the environmental protection strategy; introduce a national carbon pricing mechanism and expand alignment with and implementation of MRVA acquis for the purpose of aligning with the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)in its full scope;\n\n\u00aeimprove the policy dialogue with civil society organisations and ensure transparent public participation; ensure that infrastructure investments comply with the EU environmental and climate acquis and national and international nature and water obligations.\n\nCluster 5: Resources, agriculture and cohesion\n\nChapter 11: Agriculture and rural development\n\nSerbia has some level of preparation in agriculture and rural development. Limited progress was made with the rollover of entrusted IPARD measures.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were implemented to a limited extent and therefore remain largely valid. In the coming year, Serbia should, in particular:\n\n\u00aeurgently take measures to start implementation of IPARD III and avoid further losses of EU funds, notably by increasing capacity building, ensuring more efficient contracting and implementation of projects, and preparing new measures for entrustment as soon as possible;\n\n\u00aespeed up the implementation of the action plan to align with the EU acquis in agriculture and rural development and adopt legislation relevant to agricultural markets, quality policy and organic farming;\n\n\u00aeadopt a national strategy for agriculture and rural development.\n\nChapter 12 - Food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy\n\nSerbia is moderately prepared in the area of food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy. Limited progress was made during the reporting period following the adoption of two framework laws which aim to align with the EU acquis.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were implemented to a limited extent and therefore remain largely valid. In the coming year, Serbia should, in particular:\n\n\u00aeadopt the framework legislation on food safety, official controls, animal health, animal welfare, plant health and genetically modified organisms, aligned with the EU acquis; strengthen administrative capacity to ensure correct implementation;\n\n\u00aeadopt and start implementing the national plan to align legislation with EU quality standards for raw milk;\n\n\u00aeprioritise the process of upgrading establishments producing food, feed and animal by-products to meet EU structural standards.\n\nChapter 13 - Fisheries and aquaculture\n\nSerbia is moderately prepared in the area of fisheries and aquaculture. Some progress was made during the reporting period, in particular with the adoption of the action plan for alignment with the EU acquis by the date of accession.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were partially implemented. In the coming year, Serbia should, in particular:\n\n\u00aestart implementing the action plan for alignment with the EU acquis, in particular on the organisation of markets, aquaculture, data collection, control measures and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing;\n\n\u00aeaddress the severe understaffing of the authorities responsible for developing policy and anti-fraud controls for fisheries (including border controls).\n\nChapter 22: Regional policy and coordination of structural instruments\n\nSerbia is moderately prepared in the area of regional policy and the coordination of structural instruments. It made limited progress, notably by increasing its administrative capacity and improving programming.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were implemented to a limited extent, and therefore remain largely valid. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aeput in place a national plan to promote regional development and effectively address regional disparities, and build a resilient ecosystem involving all levels of government and relevant non-state bodies, in line with the partnership principle;\n\n\u00aeadvance the public administration reforms in a coordinated manner, implementing effectively its local-self-government component, through the necessary financial and fiscal decentralisation;\n\n\u00aestrengthen further the financial management and control systems and the capacity for indirect management of EU funds by adopting a comprehensive staff retention policy and tackling the issue of understaffing in critical functions and in the institutions that manage EU funds.\n\nChapter 33: Financial and budgetary provisions\n\nSerbia has some level of preparation in the area of financial and budgetary provisions. No progress was made over the reporting period.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were not implemented and therefore remain valid. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aedevelop organisational and procedural links between the institutions involved in the own resources system;\n\n\u00aecontinue preparations to meet the specific administrative conditions for own resources, as laid down in the EU own resources regulations, including by drafting an action plan with a timeline to meet the administrative conditions.\n\nCluster 6: External relations\n\nChapter 30: External relations\n\nSerbia is moderately prepared in the area of external relations. No progress was made as Serbia temporarily introduced a number of trade restrictive measures that were not in line with the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA).\n\nThe Commission\u2019s recommendations from last year were implemented to a limited extent and therefore remain largely valid. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aerefrain from adopting new trade restrictive measures;\n\n\u00aeadopt a WTO-compliant law on genetically modified organisms to move forward in the remaining negotiations on bilateral market access and finalise its accession to the WTO;\n\n\u00aecontinue to implement the actions set out in the new common regional market action plan for 2025-2028 and implement the nine decisions adopted in the context of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) in October 2024 and the four decisions adopted in February 2025.\n\nChapter 31 - Foreign, security and defence policy\n\nSerbia is moderately prepared in the area of EU common foreign, security and defence policy.Overall, it made limited progress over the reporting period. While alignment patterns remained largely unchanged, Serbia aligned retroactively with several Council decisions and EU statements, including some decisions listing Russian citizens and statements condemning Russia\u2019s actions . Still, some of Serbia\u2019s actions and statements went against key EU foreign policy positions, especially on the Russian Federation. High-level and frequent bilateral contacts with Russia intensified, including attendance at the 9 May Russian military parade, combined with recurrent anti-Western narratives, raising further questions about Serbia\u2019s strategic direction. Serbia\u2019s Free Trade Agreement with China entered into force on 1 July 2024, posing a strategic concern. Serbia has not aligned with the EU sanctions on Russia\u2019s war of aggression on Ukraine, however, Serbia continued cooperating with the EU on countering sanctions circumvention and providing support to Ukraine. Serbia continued to participate in and contribute substantially to EU crisis management missions and operations under the EU\u2019s common security and defence policy.\n\nThe recommendations issued in 2024 were implemented to a limited extent and therefore remain valid. In the coming year, Serbia should in particular:\n\n\u00aeimprove, as a matter of priority, its alignment with EU common foreign and security policy (CFSP), including restrictive measures, and avoid actions and statements that go against EU foreign policy positions;\n\n\u00aemake credible efforts to close the space for foreign information manipulation and interference (FIMI), including disinformation, and take action to build societal resilience against it and other forms of hybrid threats;\n\n\u00aecontinue to take action to prevent any attempt to use the territory of Serbia or legal bodies registered in Serbia to circumvent EU restrictive measures.\n\n1.3 State of play of the accession negotiations\n\nClusters Chapters/areas State of play\n1.

Cluster 1: The fundamentals of the accession process\n\n2.1. Functioning of democratic institutions and public administration reform\n\n2.1.1 Democracy\n\nThere are challenges in Serbia in the functioning of democratic institutions due to an increasingly polarised political situation, both at national and local levels. The tragic fall of a canopy at the Novi Sad railway station on 1 November 2024 that killed 16 people prompted mass nation-wide student and citizen protests and blockades across the country that continue to take place. For the most part, the authorities allowed the protests to take place and police ensured security during the protests. However, several incidents and attacks against students and peaceful protesters have been recorded, including attacks that led to heavy injuries, hit and run cases and other physical attacks. Incidents intensified over the summer, including vandalism and attacks on properties of individuals and businesses seen as supportive of the protests. There were also incidents of attacks against unprotected ruling party premises. As of late June, the authorities have adopted a more repressive approach, including numerous arrests and reports of excessive use of force against protesters. State officials frequently framed the protests as a foreign-backed \u2018colour revolution\u2019 aimed at overthrowing the constitutional order of the country, thereby undermining the legitimacy of the issues raised by students and citizens. At the same time, the President granted pardon to several individuals responsible for attacks on students, and some student protesters, shielding them from criminal prosecution. All key state universities were blocked, and teaching process was suspended for months. Online classes and in-person teaching at some state faculties resumed at the end of June. Several governmental measures on research and education interfered with the institutional autonomy of faculties and eroded academic freedom, notably the temporary reduction of salaries for teaching and academic staff and the limitation of working hours dedicated to research.\n\nElections\n\nThe general framework regarding elections requires comprehensive reform. Priority OSCE/ODIHR recommendations are yet to be implemented. These relate to the separation of state and party, inclusiveness and comprehensiveness of the electoral reform, audit of the voter register and transparency of voter list data, greater oversight of election campaigns and their financing, and measures to enable media freedom and independence.\n\nAn inclusive parliamentary working group on the improvement of election conditions was set up, chaired by a CSO representative, but failed to reach consensus or produce effective results. By February 2025, both opposition representatives and CSOs had withdrawn from it. The working group had focused on changes to the Law on unified voter register, on which alternative proposals were drafted, one by the ruling party SNS and one by a renowned Serbian CSO. Between March and September 2025, the ODIHR provided opinions on various versions of the ruling party\u2019s proposals. The parliamentary Committee for constitutional and legislative issues organised nine public hearings on various draft proposals. Only one was attended by CSOs and some opposition parties sporadically took part. In October, the ruling party and expert CSOs reached an agreement on the draft law which remains to be adopted.\n\nIn December 2024, the Parliament\u2019s secretariat adopted a rulebook on the internal organisation foreseeing the establishment of a new sector of support to the State Electoral Commission.\n\n![Image 2](blob:http://localhost/1a0811d6e8204720497b91c9648bfb62)No national elections were held during the reporting period. The Constitutional Court has not issued rulings on opposition motions challenging the December 2023 snap parliamentary and local elections yet. In June 2025, regular local elections were held in municipalities of Zaje\u010dar and Kosjeri\u0107. According to domestic CSOs observers they were \u2018neither free not fair\u2019 and were held in a \u2018climate of fear and repression, marked by institutional pressure, violence and heavy police presence in front of the polling stations throughout the day\u2019. In the aftermath of the elections in Zaje\u010dar, a legal and political controversy emerged regarding the constitution of the City administration. After the High Court annulled the constitutive session of the City Assembly for being held after the legal deadline, the ruling majority proceeded with the election of the City leadership nevertheless, on the basis of an opinion by the competent Ministry.\n\nDespite some measures to achieve a more balanced representation, including a gender quota of 40% for electoral lists, in practice women remain underrepresented in political life. The widest disparities remain at local level.\n\nParliament\n\nThe effectiveness, autonomy and transparency of the work of Parliament, and the role of the parliamentary opposition, need to be strengthened. The exercise of parliamentary powers is limited by the low frequency of sessions, a lack of genuine political debate, and a lack of an annual work plan for Parliament, with its agenda almost entirely driven by the government. Plenary and committee sessions continue to be marked by tensions and offensive language. Two plenary sessions during the reporting period were marked by incidents, including verbal and physical attacks. At times, parliamentary sessions lacked an impartial reaction from the Speaker, as stipulated by the procedural rules, due to direct exchanges with the opposition.\n\nNearly all laws and bills adopted by Parliament had been proposed by the government. The practice of amalgamating a number of unrelated agenda items continued, and in November 2024, 68 acts, including the State budget, were adopted without any debate. Contrary to constitutional rules, opposition motions for the dismissal of the Speaker were not included in the agenda for debate and vote. Eleven public hearings were held in 2025 and two in 2024. No sessions of MP questions to the government were held in 2025 and only two were held in 2024 (in July and September). The use of the urgency procedure remained low (9.15% from September 2024 until September 2025).\n\nEU integration\n\nThe negotiating structure framework for EU accession was amended in November 2024. The centralised and politically driven coordination structures remain largely unchanged from previous arrangements. The bodies supporting EU accession negotiations now also oversee the implementation of the Reform and Growth Facility. Accordingly, the Minister for European Integration serves simultaneously as Chief Negotiator and as Coordinator of the Reform and Growth Facility for the 2024-2027 period. The Ministry for European Integration continues to be the formal focal point for consultations and engagement with civil society, business community and local self-governments in the negotiating process.\n\nIn November 2024, the government brought forward its strategic objective to meet all technical criteria for EU membership by one year and set the new target date to the end of 2026. To align with this accelerated timeline, the Government adopted, in April 2025, a dedicated Plan for fulfilling the key obligations from the EU accession negotiation process, and subsequently, in August 2025, amended the National Program for the Adoption of the Acquis (NPAA), thereby ensuring consistency between these documents and with its commitments under the Reform and Growth Facility. Despite this more ambitious goal, Serbia has not advanced substantially in terms of alignment with the EU acquis. Nevertheless, certain progress has been made in improving institutional IT planning.\n\nSerbia continues to declare EU membership a strategic goal. To convincingly demonstrate this strategic goal, the Serbian authorities need to prioritise unambiguous, proactive and objective communication about the EU and about Serbia\u2019s accession path. In parallel, they must carry out a determined, consistent and genuine implementation of EU-related reforms.\n\nThe National Convention on the EU (NCEU), an umbrella platform engaging CSOs in the accession process, continues to act as a public watchdog for the accession negotiations. However, in February 2025, the NCEU suspended their participation in processes that entail cooperation with political decision-makers citing deteriorating environment for civil society as well as loss of inclusivity and lack of meaningful participation of civil society in political processes.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe practical exercise of presidential powers is intensively debated in public discourse, amid concerns that the political debate and the decision-making is in practice steered by the President in a way that is not intended under the Constitution.\n\nSeveral changes to the government composition occurred during the reporting period. Following the fall of the canopy at the Novi Sad railway station, two ministers resigned in late 2024. Following a violent physical attack against student protesters, the Prime Minister resigned on 28 January 2025. Parliament formally took note of the resignation, ending the mandate of the entire government on 19 March. A new government was appointed on 16 April. The political composition and the number of ministerial posts have not changed. Out of 31 members, nine are women. Representatives of national minorities continue to hold ministerial posts.\n\nThe autonomy of independent bodies needs to be fully exercised, their roles acknowledged and respected by the authorities, and their recommendations followed up more thoroughly and in a timely manner.\n\nAs regards local self-government, the Law on Vojvodina\u2019s financing resources has not been adopted yet, contrary to constitutional requirement. Local administrative capacity is weak and significant disparities between municipalities persist. Local governments continue to bear responsibilities without a proper analysis of the capacity and human and financial resources required. The implementation of the programme to reform the local government system (2021-2025) continued to make slow progress (50% at the level of measures and 59% at the level of activities in 2024). The Commission for Financing Local Self-Governments did not convene regular meetings and has not met since April 2022.\n\nCivil society\n\nCSOs operate in a difficult environment and face increasing pressure and attacks. Complaints were filed against t he use of spyware targeting human rights defenders and journalists (see also personal data protection under Chapter 23). Cases of strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs) increasingly hindered the work of CSOs. One party from the ruling coalition proposed a draft law on agents of foreign influence, which was not discussed in the plenary in Parliament. Verbal attacks and smear campaigns against CSOs advocating for the rule of law have intensified since the start of the protests (see also freedom of assembly under Chapter 23). Several foreign civil society representatives, including from EU Member States, were detained and expelled from Serbia. In February 2025, the police searched the offices of four CSOs at the request of the Special Anti-Corruption Department of the Higher Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office in Belgrade. This is the second time that CSOs have been publicly accused of money laundering, after the \u2018List\u2019 case of July 2020 which has not yet resulted in an indictment, and the searches have been widely perceived as an act of pressure on civil society. In this context, 29 CSOs announced in February 2025 their withdrawal from the government\u2019s working groups. While implementation of the strategy and the new action plan for civil society has continued, its impact has yet to be demonstrated. CSOs froze their membership in the Council for cooperation and development of civil society in January 2025, due to the Council\u2019s lack of institutional reaction to increasing attacks on human rights defenders. The transparency and fairness of public funding to civil society still needs to be improved. Key challenges include the lack of transparent criteria for approving support to CSOs and for selecting independent experts in evaluation commissions, and in reporting on how the funds are spent.\n\nCivilian oversight of the security and intelligence sector\n\nThe parliamentary Committee for the oversight of security services remains responsible for civilian oversight of the security sector. In March 2025, the Committee discussed allegations of the use of a sonic device during a mass protest on 15 March in Belgrade and dismissed such claims. Representatives of the civilian security agency (BIA) alleged that an \u2018attempt of a colour revolution\u2019 was taking place in Serbia. During mass student and citizens\u2019 protests, there were reports that BIA was detaining and summoning citizens, students and activists for informative talks. In December 2024, the Committee held a regular annual review of the activities of the Military-Security Agency. A Law on access to state security files still needs to be adopted.\n\n2.1.2. Public administration reform\n\nStrategic framework for public administration reform (PAR)\n\nA comprehensive PAR strategy (2021-2030) is being implemented. The quality of the strategy is satisfactory, but the effectiveness of implementation needs to be improved. A new PAR action plan and programmes for 2026-2030, under the PAR umbrella strategy, are under preparation. The 2024 PAR implementation report shows slow progress overall with 57% of measures and activities implemented in 2024. The PAR online monitoring tool still does not provide an up-to-date picture of implementation, either overall or by policy pillar. Monitoring reports are adopted too late to timely provide information to decision makers and to enable the adoption of potentially necessary policy changes. PAR coordination mechanisms at political and administrative levels are formally in place, but their use in practice and their impact are limited due to the lack of clear ownership and strong political commitment. Financial sustainability remains an issue of concern due to reliance on donor funding.\n\nPolicy development and coordination\n\nPolicy development and coordination are regulated but not systematically enforced. A system for sound policymaking is in place with a clear set of regulations embedded primarily in the Law on the planning system. In March 2025, Serbia adopted new pieces of implementing legislation on the methodology for drafting public policy documents and on the analysis of the effects of regulations.Enforcement of the regulatory framework remains behind the legal deadlines. No notable progress was made to ensure that the Public Policy Secretariat\u2019s comments on draft legislation and policy documents were incorporated and that the final versions of these documents were compliant with the legislation. There was no new streamlining of sector strategic frameworks, and only three out of 23 sectors have been optimised so far. The share of published annual reports on implementation of sectoral planning documents is limited (around 30%, despite this being a legislative requirement). The national development plan, due for adoption in 2020, is still not in place. The adoption rate of mid-term plans remains low (61% for the period 2025 - 2027) and seriously lags behind the 2020 deadline set for central level institutions.\n\nPublic consultations were carried out in 2024 on 58% of draft laws and on 30% of draft regulations, which remains insufficient. There is still n o central body in charge of oversight and quality control of public consultations. Use of the e-consultations platform, although mandatory, remains insufficient. Mandatory reports on conducted public consultations are published on the platform in less than 30% of cases (see civil society under 2.1.1 Democracy).\n\nPublic financial management\n\nPublic financial management (PFM) is broadly in place but needs to be improved. The 2021-2025 PFM reform programme is being implemented in line with its action plan, but has limited ambitions and is donor-dependent. The highest-level development planning documents, the development plan and the investment plan, were due in 2020, with the delay creating ambiguities in setting national strategic priorities. The link between the strategic priorities and budget programmes remains weak. Programme budgeting is to be further developed to enable proper performance management. Green tagging methodology was integrated in budget planning procedure for the first time in 2024 and gender-responsive budgeting continues to be implemented.\n\nMacroeconomic and fiscal forecasting is well prepared and Serbia has made some progress in presenting the fiscal risks in the fiscal strategy and in strengthening medium-term budgeting. Stronger binding fiscal rules have yet to be implemented. The optimal number of key spending units needs to be specified to improve spending efficiency. The Ministry of Finance does not currently publish a stand-alone and comprehensive fiscal risk statement. The contingency reserve is used without a clear definition of purpose and transparent and regular reporting, with ad hoc spending measures a recurrent budgetary feature. Serbia continues to award large-scale infrastructure contracts without transparency, often under international agreements or through special laws. The vulnerability of public procurement to corruption needs to be carefully monitored(see Chapter 5 \u2013 Public procurement).\n\nFurther progress is needed to increase the coverage and quality of public internal financial control. The managerial accountability roadmap was adopted in December 2024, but its implementation has been delayed. Analytical units in all ministries and government agencies need to be set up without delay.The country has yet to develop a genuine single pipeline for capital investment management. For the first time, the 2025 budget and fiscal strategy include a number of capital investment projects planned over a three-year horizon.\n\nSerbia has not made progress in improving budget transparency. It has not produced a transparency roadmap or mid-year report. The Ministry of Finance does not publish the budget execution profile at the beginning of the year, preventing an analysis of any divergence from set targets. Budget execution reports still only contain basic elements. Inconsistencies in the accounting and reporting framework need to be resolved. Public participation in the budget process and budget oversight by the legislature need to be significantly improved. The 2024 budget rebalance and the 2025 budget were adopted with no qualitative assessment or debate with stakeholders and the 2024 supplementary budget was adopted using the fast-track procedure.\n\nPublic service and human resources management\n\nThe public service and human resources management (HRM) regulatory framework is satisfactory, but its effectiveness is undermined by the lack of consistent enforcement. The legal framework for HRM is solid. The horizontal and vertical scope of the civil service is adequate, except for several (regulatory) public agencies with a higher degree of autonomy that are excluded from the civil service system with no justified reason. Serbia\u2019s legislation provides for merit-based recruitment and dismissal procedures but leaves too much discretion to the heads of institutions in setting up selection committees. Around 10% of all civil servants are hired on a fixed-term basis and still do not need to pass a competition as the legal provision to that effect was postponed again to January 2026. A mandatory assessment of at least one functional competence for hiring fixed-term staff was brought in as of March 2025. Administrative bodies have limited autonomy to launch new recruitments based on their staffing plans, due to recruitment restrictions under the Law on the budget system. The new HRM management information system is not yet operational. The capacity of HRM units remains weak and they lack a strategic role. The 2016 Law on the public sector salary system was annulled after several years of postponing the application date, delaying further the salary reform. Serbia maintained effective gender balance in the administration, including in top managerial positions, with 48% women and 52% men.\n\nRegarding senior civil servants, the lack of transparency in appointing candidates recommended by the High Civil Service Council and legal compliance remain issues of serious concern. Most managerial posts (62% as of September 2025) are still occupied by acting appointments. Moreover, most acting managers are not civil servants, despite there being a legal provision against such appointments. It is crucial to secure clear political will and sufficient resources to run competitions for managerial positions and to monitor the phasing-out of the high number of acting managers to urgently reduce the excessive number of senior civil servants in acting positions.\n\nThe National Academy for Public Administration continued to improve the scope and quality of training for central and local-level public servants. Almost all (99.8%) institutions that have the obligation to adopt integrity plans have done so. Further efforts are needed to fully implement the current integrity plans for the judiciary and public administration, including at local level.\n\nAccountability of the administration\n\nThe accountability of the administration still needs to be improved. Serbia made no progress in addressing the administration\u2019s systemic organisational problems, such as overlapping roles and unclear reporting lines. In December 2024, it adopted the long overdue managerial accountability roadmap, setting out the key steps in applying this concept. According to the Ombudsman\u2019s 2024 report, nearly 61% of complaints were related to violations of economic, property and social rights, with the highest number in the sector of local government, property and the right to health. On citizens\u2019 right to access public information, the Commissioner for Information of Public Importance and Personal Data Protection resolved 15 282 complaints in 2024 (up from 10 594 in 2023), 50% (2023: 37%) of which were related to requests by people seeking information being ignored. This is a sharp increase, due to legal professionals\u2019 potential abuse of legal remedies. The execution rate of Commissioner decisions was 77.98% (2023: 74.83%). On citizens\u2019 right to administrative justice, no progress was made on structural reforms of the system, except for a slight increase in the number of judges. The establishment of a multi-layer administrative justice has been delayed. In the meantime, Serbia could consider options for expanding the scope to contest decisions by the Administrative Court in the highest court \u2013 including by the public authorities \u2013 in order to establish in practice a more effective two-instance administrative judicial system. Citizens\u2019 rights to seek compensation is regulated, but there is a lack of statistical data to monitor implementation.\n\nService delivery to citizens and businesses\n\nService delivery to citizens and businesses, in particular e-services, is continuously improving. Further developments are hampered by the fragmentation of responsibilities and mandates among institutions and the lack of a dedicated coordination system. Progress on the key enablers, such as a cloud-based e-signature system, user-friendly payment services and digital identity systems, contributed to improved e-services. The interoperability framework is also in place. There are more databases connected to the improved government service bus (an information system linking major databases). The number of municipal one-stop shops also increased but there are still no quality standards for service provision. There has been some progress in increasing user engagement and developing mechanisms for collecting feedback. The legal framework for simplifying administrative procedures is in place, although aligning sector-based legislation with the Law on general administrative procedures is still ongoing. Work continued to simplify and digitalise administrative procedures by implementing the e-paper programme. Serbia continued to improve the portal of the register of administrative procedures, which now includes approximately 3 300 procedures.\n\n2.2. Rule of law and fundamental rights\n\n2.2.1 Chapter 23: Judiciary and fundamental rights\n\nThe EU\u2019s founding values include the rule of law and respect for human rights. An effective (independent, high-quality and efficient) judicial system and an effective fight against corruption are of paramount importance, as is respect of fundamental rights in law and in practice.\n\nFunctioning of the judiciary\n\nStrategic documents\n\nStrategic documents are in place, but implementation needs to be improved. The main strategic documents are the revised action plan for Chapter 23 and the 2020-2025 judicial development strategy. Implementation of the human resources (HR) and information and communications technology (ICT) strategies remains weak, in part due to a lack of coordination and adequate monitoring mechanisms.\n\nManagement bodies\n\nThe management bodies are in place and function in line with the adopted legislation. There is a need to improve the analytical and statistical capacity of the High Judicial Council (HJC) and the High Prosecutorial Council (HPC) in line with the HR strategy.\n\nIndependence and impartiality\n\nThe independence and impartiality of the judiciary needs to be improved, both in the higher-level courts and in the courts of first instance.\n\n![Image 3](blob:http://localhost/393c3b84caec550ccc77b39376594401)Following the adoption of the implementing legislation to the constitutional amendments, Serbia has adopted 36 by-laws out of 37. In January 2025, it adopted the Rulebook on administration of the prosecution office, which is a shared competence between the Ministry of Justice and the HPC. One, on the Rules of Court, remains to be adopted.\n\n![Image 4](blob:http://localhost/ad53b6b070ecc2fef01e53fb74d27afb)Political pressure on the judiciary and the prosecution services remains high, with little or no follow-up by relevant institutions. Government and public officials at the highest level, including the President and members of Parliament, continued to make undue public comments on ongoing investigations and court proceedings, including on the work of individual prosecutors and judges. These comments included criticism of judicial decisions and threats to remove judges and prosecutors. Other comments made by officials containing information not in the public domain raise concerns about leakage of information by institutions involved in criminal proceedings. In the context of the protests, there were instances of attacks on court and prosecution offices, as well as protests held in front of court buildings. There was also an instance of a physical attack on a judge. Although the rules of procedure of the HJC and HPC lay the foundation for a more effective reaction in cases of undue influence, both Councils remained largely passive. Neither Parliament nor the government have so far acted in cases of undue influence. The Serbian institutions have yet to demonstrate a more active role.\n\nThe launch of major initiatives by the prosecution, such as the new anti-corruption campaign and the search of four NGO offices in February 2025, which followed statements by high-level public officials, raises concerns about prosecutorial autonomy. In July the President pardoned five people charged with physically harming protesters, citing the need to correct injustices caused by prosecutors and courts, which raises further concerns about the independence of the justice system.\n\nCases are allocated electronically and at random to judges via specialised software. Software enabling the automatic allocation of cases to prosecutors has yet to be developed. The system of recruiting, transferring and promoting judges and prosecutors should be further revised to ensure that careers are fully based on merit.\n\nAccountability\n\nThe accountability of the judiciary needs to be improved. In particular, there is need for greater accountability and transparency in the prosecution service and courts.\n\nIn 2024, 125 disciplinary complaints were filed to the HPC, and one disciplinary measure was issued in January 2025. In 2024, 386 disciplinary complaints were filed to the HJC at first instance and 10 proposals were forwarded to the disciplinary commission at second instance. The HJC rejected two proposals and issued two sanctions.\n\n![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/619b0303b4fd3f44406aa33fcfc155be)![Image 6](blob:http://localhost/7cf4deddfa295d3a2be7093896437b81)The term of office of the Ethics Committee appointed by the HJC ended in October 2024. In accordance with the Law on the High Judicial Council, a new committee was appointed, and it held its constitutive session on 23 January 2025.\n\nIn May 2025, the HJC began recording and publishing its sessions, thus increasing its transparency and matching the practice of the HPC.\n\nQuality of justice\n\nThe quality of justice needs to be improved.\n\nThe Law on Judicial Academy has not yet been adopted and still needs to be brought in line with the recommendations of the December 2024 Venice Commission opinion. In its opinion the Venice Commission underlined that entrusting the Academy with the exclusive responsibility for entry into the judicial and prosecutorial professions presents several advantages, including ensuring that candidates are adequately trained and prepared via a uniform examination process and eliminating parallel recruitment processes. The Venice Commission further recommended removing the ex-officio membership of the Minister of Justice in the Academy\u2019s management board to greater protect the Academy from any possible undue influence.\n\nFrom January 2024 to April 2025, the Judicial Academy conducted around 230 educational events. It should increase its institutional capacity and expertise to deliver an improved programme with clearly defined objectives. The Academy should also make further use of the expertise of the European Judicial Training Network, including on training on EU law.\n\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/aabb241c15e0e68e46dd3149f616c289)On case law harmonisation, Serbia further expanded the database of court jurisprudence. At the end of 2024, it contained 471 420 integral decisions and 66 196 anonymised court decisions. There is a need for the Supreme Court to more effectively steer jurisprudence by providing systematic guidance on contentious legal issues, particularly on repetitive cases.\n\nSerbia still lacks a comprehensive court case (and document) management system that interlinks cases across Serbian courts and prosecutors\u2019 offices. Development of the IT solution for the new case management system for prosecution offices (SAPO) was finalised and implementation of the new system across all prosecutor\u2019s offices is expected to be completed by the end of 2025. Work on the case management system for courts remains stalled. Further work is still required to ensure that all systems can operate smoothly including legislative changes, along with adequate staffing, financial resources and upgraded communication infrastructure. The judicial system suffers from insufficient human and financial resources and a lack of premises. More efforts are needed to digitalise the justice system, in particular for communication with the courts and the use of videoconferencing for court hearings.\n\n![Image 8](blob:http://localhost/f84a5a8fa9a0550e813b4096f557e35e)As of January 2025, there were 229 notaries active in Serbia. In addition to the existing system to exchange information and document authentication, in December 2024 the Notary Chamber took steps to develop a common information system for automatic exchange of data with the state geodetic authority. The Law on notaries and accompanying laws still need to be amended.\n\nIn 2024, the HJC appointed 241 judges. At the end of 2024, of the 3 102 judicial positions, 383 were vacant and 2 719 judges\u2019 positions were filled (up from 2 636 at the end of 2023). In July 2025, 42 judges were elected following a public competition launched in January.\n\nIn 2024, the HPC organised 11 competitions to fill 269 public prosecutor positions. At the end of 2024, of the 894 positions for prosecutors, 237 were vacant and 657 prosecutors were in active work (678 at the end of 2023). In September 2024, the Constitutional Court annulled for the first time an appointment procedure for prosecutors for the Belgrade Higher Prosecution Office on the finding that the HPC had breached the rules on testing candidates.\n\nThe Constitutional Court continued to work in partial composition, with only 11 of the 15 judges needed. The HJC, the HPC and the President as authorised proponents, have still not made their nominations to the appointment bodies for the four positions that have been vacant since April 2024. Seven of the 11 judges are due to retire at the end of the year, which is a concern as this would lead to the Constitutional Court losing its quorum.No steps were taken to reform the Constitutional Court, specifically to introduce qualified majority with a deadlock mechanism for the election of some of the judges by Parliament, as underlined by the Venice Commission.\n\nEfficiency\n\nThe efficiency of justice needs to be improved.\n\n![Image 9](blob:http://localhost/3c6788469d52c9ab2dd534e8a848709c)![Image 10](blob:http://localhost/98aeb0f57572675a3cdc8dc136255f45)Problems of unequal workload among judges and prosecutors have continued to negatively affect performance and access to justice. In 2024, the courts worked on \n\n2 796 635 cases and solved 1 754 383 cases. There was an increase in solved cases, including old cases, reducing the number of pending cases at the end of 2024 (1 042 252 from 1 095 599 in 2023). While Serbia continued to perform well in first instance civil and commercial cases (with a clearance rate of 119% and a shorter disposition time of 274 days), administrative justice remains a critical bottleneck. In particular, the situation at the Administrative Court remains a concern. Despite the reduction in incoming cases - linked to fewer \u2018silence of the administration\u2019 cases - the clearance rate remains low at 76% (compared to 35% in 2023) and the disposition time stands at 1 933 days (compared to 2 095 in 2023). Consequently, the number of pending administrative cases at the end of 2024 exceeded that of 2023 (163 133 in 2024, compared to 153 214 in 2023). Serbia continued to implement the unified backlog reduction programme for 2021-2025, but without significant reductions.\n\nThe Constitutional Court still had a high backlog of pending cases (43 666 as of July 2025, up from 29 672 in 2023). In 2024, the Constitutional Court received 18 211 new cases, of which 17 972 were constitutional appeals, and solved 16 435 cases. The information system of the Constitutional Court has been operational since February 2025, but action is needed to simplify access to judgments.\n\nDomestic processing of war crime cases\n\nSerbia has yet to show a genuine commitment to investigating and adjudicating war crime cases. In 2024, the War Crimes Prosecutor\u2019s Office filed eight indictments against 10 individuals, including one case involving two individuals that was transferred from Bosnia and Herzegovina. One indictment has not yet been confirmed. Two final decisions and one first instance verdict were rendered against three accused. At the end of 2024, trial proceedings were ongoing in 17 cases.\n\n![Image 11](blob:http://localhost/6ce004eb2962444a4b92a07cdd58569c)Serbia continued to avoid filing indictments against high-level suspects and the time taken to process cases was excessively long. Serbia has yet to take steps to increase the pace of processing war crime cases or to tackle the significant backlog of over 1 800 pre-investigative cases, which remain a very serious concern. Contrary to the intention set out in the revised war crimes prosecutorial strategy of 2022, Serbia has yet to finalise a case categorisation plan.\n\n![Image 12](blob:http://localhost/d2c5f262ae4d7946bde9e3ab49037079)In 2024, the HPC announced a public competition for the election of the Chief Public Prosecutor for War Crimes and two candidates applied. The selection procedure is ongoing but severely delayed. An acting Chief Public Prosecutor was appointed until his mandate ended on 15 May 2025, leaving the position vacant.\n\nCooperation has continued with the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals Prosecution Office and the War Crimes Prosecutor\u2019s Office. Cooperation with Bosnia and Herzegovina also continued, but little progress was made with Croatia and Kosovo. Serbia has yet to enforce the judgments of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the cases of Novak Djuki\u0107, Du\u0161ko Kornja\u010da and Tomislav Kova\u010d, who reside in Serbia.Such individuals are able to evade justice by taking advantage of prohibitions against extradition of nationals for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. They also benefit from neighbouring jurisdictions\u2019 lack of progress in addressing the crimes in question.\n\nA number of Serbian political parties, politicians and media outlets continued to provide support to, and public space for, convicted war criminals and to deny war crimes, including the Srebrenica genocide, without repercussions.\n\nThe sentencing policy in war crime cases has been inconsistent and not systematically aligned with the criminal sanctions applicable to the gravity of the crimes. Serbia\u2019s judiciary has failed to include financial compensation to the victims of war crimes in any criminal proceedings. This approach is yet to be remedied.\n\nThe unresolved fate of missing persons who disappeared during the conflicts in the 1990s remains a key issue to be solved in the Western Balkans. Despite steady progress in identification, 9 62 4 persons are still missing as a result of the conflict. Further efforts are needed at bilateral level and at regional level through the missing persons group, established in 2018 under the Berlin Process to strengthen cooperation. The UN[Committee on Enforced Disappearances](https://www.ohchr.org/en/treaty-bodies/ced) issu ed its findings on Serbia, recommending expanding the victim definition to ensure inclusivity and to cover full reparation for all affected individuals.\n\nFight against corruption\n\nTrack record\n\n![Image 13](blob:http://localhost/d9fe9cbc02143814b5173d4286c29161)The fight against corruption track record should be improved for both high-level and non-high-level cases.\n\n![Image 14](blob:http://localhost/d6b7532cded2187bdf1e9f80599cb61e)Significant challenges persist, particularly in addressing high-level cases. The number of final convictions in high-level corruption cases in 2024 decreased compared to previous years (28 down from 31 in 2023). The Prosecutor\u2019s Office for Organised Crime ordered investigations against fewer individuals (18 in 2024 compared to 50 in 2023) and fewer indictments were issued (45 in 2024 down from 74 in 2023).W eaknesses in the investigation and prosecution of high-level corruption cases have not been adequately addressed, in particular regarding the quality of evidentiary collection and presentation and the risk of politically motivated interference.\n\nFollowing the canopy collapse at Novi Sad railway station, authorities launched investigations into alleged corruption linked to the tragic incident, which are yet to be completed. Criminal proceedings were initiated against 15 persons, including two former ministers, as a result of the work of the task force for the investigation of financial flows related to the project \u2018Modernisation and reconstruction of the Hungarian-Serbian railway line on the route Novi Sad-Subotica-State Border (Kelebija)\u2019. The tragic incident prompted widespread public protests over corruption and the perceived political capture of state institutions, the lack of accountability and transparency in government infrastructure and construction projects.\n\nRegarding non-high-level corruption, special departments for combating corruption in the offices of higher prosecutors and the prosecution offices of general jurisdiction launched more investigations in 2024 than in the previous year (607 up from 515), but the number of indictments and final convictions fell (313 down from 367, and 259 down from 326 respectively). This downward trend raises concerns about the capacity to address mid and lower-level corruption effectively.\n\nSerbia is expected to submit its compliance report to GRECO in December 2025 to address the recommendations of the fifth evaluation round. GRECO previously assessed that of the 24 recommendations, one recommendation has been fully met, and 10 have been partially met. Serbia should fully implement all recommendations, including those only partially completed from the fourth round.\n\nThe perception among the public, experts and businesses is that the level of corruption in the public sector is high. This perception has remained relatively unchanged in recent years.\n\nLegal framework\n\nThe legal framework on the fight against corruption is in place but it needs to be improved in terms of both preventive measures and law enforcement. While the Law on prevention of corruption is generally well-designed, there are shortcomings. In particular, the scope, which among other prescribes the duty to file asset declarations and report conflicts of interest, does not extend to all high-ranking public officials who are particularly vulnerable to corruption. Legal amendments to address GRECO\u2019s fifth-round recommendations and OSCE/ODIHR guidelines on electoral campaign financing have yet to be adopted. Legislation on access to information and lobbying requires further amending to implement the recommendations issued by OSCE/ODIHR, OECD SIGMA (Support for Improvement in Governance and Management), and GRECO.\n\nAmendments to the Law on financing of political activities have yet to be adopted to address outstanding ODIHR recommendations including the effectiveness of the oversight mechanism. The Agency for the Prevention of Corruption\u2019s initiative to amend the law is still pending with the Ministry of Finance. The legal framework on whistle-blower protection has yet to be aligned with the EU acquis.\n\nExemptions from the Law on public procurement, particularly in the context of intergovernmental agreements and special laws, continue to be widely used to circumvent the practical application of the law. Wide use of exemptions undermines the effectiveness of the law and should be phased out. This poses risks of corruption and non-compliance with European standards. It is important that all entities, and in particular those with significant public expenditure, comply with the State Audit Institution\u2019s recommendations. The authorities should encourage the proactive disclosure of contracts, procurement processes and oversight reports, and step up the protection of whistle-blowers to build public trust. Serbia should further reinforce the SAI\u2019s staffing, financial and technical capacities to oversee public spending.\n\nIn terms of repression, the Law on the organisation and jurisdiction of state authorities in suppression of organised crime, terrorism and corruption does not give sufficient competences to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office for Organised Crime (POOC), which has jurisdiction over high-level corruption cases, to coordinate the corruption cases of the special departments of the Higher Public Prosecutors\u2019 offices. In particular, the special departments are not obligated to inform the POOC about the launch of investigations, creating the risk of opening parallel proceedings. Serbia should take further steps to ensure effective coordination.\n\nStrategic documents\n\nA national anti-corruption strategy for 2024-2028 is in place. In December 2024, an action plan for 2024-2025 was adopted but it does not comprehensively address the GRECO recommendations issued in the fourth and fifth evaluation rounds. The pace and level of implementation should be increased, and an effective monitoring, evaluation and coordination mechanism should be put in place.\n\nThe Agency for the Prevention of Corruption is tasked with monitoring implementation, but sufficient coordination mechanisms, budgetary resources and an effective monitoring and evaluation system to track progress and impact is needed for its effective implementation.\n\nSerbia should finalise and adopt the action plan for the period 2026-2028, ensuring it comprehensively addresses the challenges identified in the strategy, as well as the outstanding GRECO recommendations.\n\nInstitutional framework\n\nThe institutional framework governing the fight against corruption is largely in place but needs improvement in terms of preventive measures and law enforcement.\n\nIn February 2025, the special departments for combating corruption of the Higher Prosecutor\u2019s Offices in Belgrade, Novi Sad, Kraljevo and Nis launched initiatives that led to a series of corruption-related arrests of public officials, including in long-standing cases. The fact that these initiatives were launched following the President\u2019s announcement of a major anti-corruption campaign raises concerns about prosecutorial autonomy.\n\nThe Agency for Prevention of Corruption started 202 procedures to determine violations of the Law on prevention of corruption with regard to conflicts of interest (264 in 2023, 483 in 2022) and submitted 131 requests to start misdemeanour proceedings on the failure to promptly submit asset declarations (143 in 2023, 201 in 2022). Overall, these activities to prevent corruption have yielded limited results. The Agency needs more human and technical resources to be able to work in a comprehensive manner. In addition, steps should be taken to increase the independence, impartiality and accountability of the Agency.\n\nThe fact that the authorities have still not established a more constructive relationship with the Anti-Corruption Council, nor addressed the findings of their reports, remains a serious concern. In addition, the Council is still not systematically consulted on draft legislation. No steps have been taken to further increase the Anti-Corruption Council\u2019s budgetary resources or staffing.\n\nThe Prosecutor\u2019s Office for Organised Crime remains understaffed and lacks adequate premises to accommodate new staff, while the specialised organised crime unit within the police lacks sufficient personnel to investigate high-level corruption effectively.\n\nThe special departments in the higher prosecution offices should each have a financial forensic expert. Two experts were hired on a contractual basis in the Higher Public Prosecution Offices in Belgrade and Novi Sad, but the positions have not been filled on a permanent basis.\n\nFundamental rights\n\nWhile Serbia\u2019s legislative and institutional framework for upholding fundamental rights is broadly in place, implementation of the framework needs to be improved as a matter of priority.\n\nInternational human rights instruments\n\nCooperation with international human rights monitoring bodies and the follow-up to their recommendations need to be improved.Serbia has ratified the main international human rights instruments and continued to benefit from its observer status at the Fundamental Rights Agency.\n\nEuropean Court of Human Rights\n\n![Image 15](blob:http://localhost/1f3172e4b46727edd520d2b23b11924f)Cooperation with the European Court of Human Rights and implementation of its judgments need to be improved. During the reporting period, the Court found breaches of the European Convention on Human Rights relating mainly to the right to a fair trial, respect for private and family life, prohibition of torture and protection of property. Currently, there are 12 cases under enhanced supervision by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (23 cases last year). These cases concern mainly ill treatment/torture, failure to comply with interim measures of the Court, excessive length of judicial proceedings, unfair criminal proceedings and peaceful enjoyment of possession. No actions were taken to further regulate the role of Serbia\u2019s government agent before the European Court of Human Rights, to avoid repetition of a previous case when Serbia did not comply with an interim measure of the Court. The government agent needs to be given a coordination role and the authority to fulfil it. Serbia has yet to adopt amendments to the Law on the National DNA Registry to implement the mechanism providing individual redress to parents in cases similar to that of Zorica Jovanovi\u0107 v Serbia. The transfer of the Ka\u010dapor v Serbia group of cases from ordinary courts to the Constitutional Court has contributed to the execution of this judgment, but further action is needed to sustain progress.\n\nPromotion and enforcement of human rights\n\nThe institutional framework for the promotion, protection and enforcement of human rights needs to be improved. There has been little, or delayed, public reaction by the Ombudsperson to human rights violations in the context of the student and citizen protests (see also Freedom of assembly). CSOs submitted an initiative to Parliament calling for the dismissal of the Ombudsperson, in particular due to his actions in the area of women\u2019s ![Image 16](blob:http://localhost/4f50e83f9be56dbda417ddfcabd5a231)rights. The Ombudsperson\u2019s Office is still operating with fewer staff (65 as of August 2025) than the staffing figure set in the action plan for Chapter 23 (106). Staff turnover continues to hamper efficiency. In June 2025, after several years of delay, Parliament adopted conclusions on the Ombudsperson\u2019s reports for 2022, 2023 and 2024.\n\nPrevention of torture and ill treatment\n\n![Image 17](blob:http://localhost/410cec932a636895a1942604f6dfa350)The follow-up to cases of ill treatment needs to be improved.In the context of the student and citizen protests, there were reports of excessive use of force by the police. The Ombudsperson, in capacity as National Preventive Mechanism against Torture (NPM), partnered with additional CSOs. Cooperation with civil society requires further improvement in terms of incorporating their proposals when preparing visit reports and developing recommendations. An agreement on cooperation between the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Health was signed in October 2024, with the aim of preventing ill treatment and torture; this must be followed up with the confidential examination of people in police custody and the proper recording of injuries. Several recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishments (CPT) have yet to be addressed, especially on eradicating police ill treatment and ensuring effective investigations of such cases, to prevent the impunity of perpetrators. Action is still needed to achieve accurate recordings of police interviews with audio and video equipment and to protect the rights of individuals in remand detention and their right of access to a lawyer without undue delay. The Council of Europe\u2019s Committee of Ministers continued to supervise the execution of judgments in cases of investigations of ill treatment under the enhanced procedure. In November and December 2024, the CPT paid two ad hoc visits to Serbia, focusing on treatment and safeguards for children, adolescents and adult patients deprived of their liberty in psychiatric facilities. In its visit to Serbia in June 2025, the UN Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture expressed concerns over persons with disabilities in institutions and over children in extended periods of pre-trial detention under restrictive conditions. Serbia has still not revised the Criminal Code amendments of 2019, which brought in life imprisonment without the possibility of conditional release for a number of crimes, contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights and the case law.\n\n![Image 18](blob:http://localhost/868c6d85b118958931af43deb877ee49)Execution of criminal sanctions\n\nThe system for the execution of criminal sanctions (including probation) needs to be improved.Renovation programmes continued in several facilities, including in the Special Prison Hospital in Belgrade. The number of health staff increased, and the procurement of medicine and medical equipment was centralised.\n\n![Image 19](blob:http://localhost/123ca5137473a67dd159e3f8d5e56fe6) A new treatment programme for people convicted of sexual offences was piloted and treatment staff trained. Individual and group work was prescribed to juvenile perpetrators under specialised programmes. The rise in non-custodial sanctions continued, mainly in the form of house arrest and a low use of community penalties. Despite employing 15 additional commissioners, the probation, social and employment services still lacked sufficient resources.\n\nProtection of personal data\n\nThe legal framework for the protection of personal data (PDP) needs to be further aligned with the EU acquis and the capacities of the PDP authority need to be improved.The PDP law is mostly aligned with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Law Enforcement Directive (LED). However, the law is insufficient with regards e.g. to penalties and it is difficult to implement in practice as it includes provisions from both the GDPR and the LED. The process of harmonising all other laws with the PDP law is significantly delayed. As of June 2025, the Office of the Commissioner for Information of Public Importance and Personal Data Protection had 121 employees, moving closer to the target of 129 set in the action plan for Chapter 23. The Commissioner opened a third regional office. In March 2025, Serbia adopted, with delay, the action plan on the PDP strategy, which plans amendments to the PDP law by mid-2026. The new strategy for development of artificial intelligence was adopted in January 2025 without an analysis of the previous strategy, as legally required. Following the Commissioner\u2019s previous negative opinions on the Ministry of the Interior\u2019s impact assessment on street video surveillance, a legal basis has not yet been developed. The proportionality and necessity of the proposed system of video surveillance in public spaces needs to be assessed. Complaints were filed against t he use of spyware and mobile phone forensic products targeting human rights defenders and journalists. Spyware attacks or attempts of their use were found on phone devices of people who had spent time in detention or police interviews, and an increasing number of cases were reported by those ![Image 20](blob:http://localhost/6fca95584c79e4eacc19e64055ffa59c)arrested during the protests. A case concerning at least seven people is at the pre-investigation stage, with no indication of progress so far. The Ombudsperson and the Commissioner for Personal Data Protection announced the opening of cases on these attacks but have not yet reported on the outcome. Such surveillance produces a chilling effect and may lead to self-censorship. The disclosure to tabloids of the personal data of participants in the student protests and on social networks has remained unpunished. The personal data of judges, including those who ruled in favour of repeating some local elections, were also disclosed in tabloid press campaigns, without eliciting an appropriate reaction.\n\nFreedom of religion or belief\n\nSerbia provides adequate legal guarantees on the freedom of religion or belief. However, the registration process for religious communities remained non-transparent and inconsistent. The Law on churches and religious communities is not yet aligned with European standards. Serbia continued to implement the Law on the restitution of heirless Jewish property.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFreedom of expression\n\nThe environment for media and its free, independent and professional operation is constrained.\n\nIntimidation of journalists\n\nCases of threats, intimidation, hate speech and violence against journalists increased and are not consistently condemned by the authorities. Female journalists and local journalists are particularly vulnerable to such attacks. Recurrent statements by high-level officials on the work of journalists and media workers have a chilling effect on the freedom of expression. Several foreign journalists, including from EU Member States, were denied entry to Serbia before the protests. The personal data of journalists was disclosed, including by some media. The number of attacks and cases of pressure increased in the course of 2025 compared to the same period of the previous year, including physical attacks, some of which were in the presence of police that did not respond.Cases have also been reported of the use of police force against journalists, of preventing media workers from reporting on the protests and of journalists being briefly detained. Cases brought by the prosecution services during the reporting period resulted in only one conviction and one deferred criminal prosecution. No progress was made in the prosecution of the three murders of journalists, one of which reached the statute of limitation. Cases of strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs) increasingly hindered the work of investigative media. Serbia needs to align with the Anti-SLAPP Directive and Recommendation, including by covering the early dismissal of manifestly unfounded claims and remedies against abusive court proceedings.\n\nLegislative environment\n\nSerbia amended the media legislation in June 2025 to align further with the EU acquis and European standards. There were very short consultations of media associations at the end of the process but, overall,the drafting process lacked transparent and inclusive consultations and did not respect the legal obligation to hold a public debate, except for the Law on public broadcasters. Following the amendments of 2023 that allowed state-owned companies to be media owners, additional safeguards to protect media pluralism and editorial independence were brought in; they will need to be monitored in practice. Meanwhile, TV channels seen as critical of the authorities were removed in April 2025 from a TV platform following the purchase of this platform by Telekom Srbija, whose majority stakeholder is the state. Serbia has not adopted a new action plan on the media strategy since the previous plan expired at the end of 2022. Parliament did not elect a new Council of the media regulator, REM, by the legal deadline of 4 November 2024 and, as a result, Serbia has been without the decision-making body of the media regulator since then. The relevant parliamentary committee published the call for nominations only on 25 November 2024. Seven out of 18 candidates withdrew their applications citing irregularities that the committee did not address, and the call was annulled. Several candidates and proposers also initially withdrew at the start of the second call. However, with international facilitation, the process resumed and advanced with the shortlisting of candidates.\n\nImplementation of legislation/institutions\n\nThe media laws of 2023 have been inconsistently implemented. The REM failed to fully exercise its mandate and serious concerns regarding its independence in practice persisted. In 2024, the REM issued only five measures and did not sufficiently impose penalties for frequent violations of the rules, such as media with national frequencies broadcasting content targeting journalists and civil society or reality shows that are prone to violence. In November 2024, the parliamentary committee for culture and information gave consent to the new statute of the REM Council which contains new provisions on the secrecy of certain documents adopted by the Council, thus hindering transparency. The REM published the full report on election media monitoring only 14 months after the December 2023 elections. The competition for the allocation of the fifth frequency for national broadcasting, launched in 2022, has still not been finalised without justified reason for the delay. Serbia did not take any action to counter foreign information manipulation and interference. By contrast, the REM Council awarded RT (Russian TV) with a licence enabling it to launch its programme in Serbian on the majority state-owned Telekom cable operator. 41% of journalist complaints to the Commissioner for Information of Public Importance concerned the \u2018institutional silence\u2019 of public bodies. Access to sensitive information was denied regarding cases of environmental damage, capital projects, the use of public resources or co-financing of media projects.\n\nPublic service broadcaster\n\nSerbia adopted amendments to the Law on Public Broadcasting Services in June 2025 to make the public broadcasters more institutionally and functionally independent. It remains to be seen whether the current public broadcasting service fee is sufficient to cover the needs of the public broadcasters or whether they still need to rely on additional state funding, which would prevent full financial independence. Concerns over issues of editorial autonomy, limited pluralism and biased reporting in favour of the government increased. In 2024, 94% of airtime in central RTS news broadcasts covered the ruling majority, against 6% of airtime for opposition parties. In March and April 2025, students and citizens blocked the main buildings of RTS and RTV, demanding more objective reporting on the protests. The two-week blockade of RTS eventually led to the relaunch of the call for the REM Council election. Permanent positions of RTV editors-in-chief (which have been filled in acting status since 2023) and programme director have not been appointed.\n\nEconomic factors\n\nPolitical and economic influence on the media, including on editorial policy, is a source of serious concern. In August 2025, a leaked phone conversation between the CEOs of a private media group and of majority state-owned Telekom Srbija regarding personnel changes in the former raised concerns about political pressure on media outlets perceived as critical towards the authorities. A high number of registered media outlets combined with a limited advertising market produce economic uncertainty, especially at local level. This means that media often strongly depend on public co-funding. In January 2025, Serbia established a Unified Information System on public co-funding of media. The Ministry of Information and Telecommunication increased the 2025 budget for public co-funding at national level. However, new calls published in 2024 significantly reduced public funding in several municipalities, and the remaining public funding was awarded through less transparent processes, such as the procurement of information services and advertising. Some media outlets that violated the Code of Ethics continued to receive public co-financing, although the Law on Public Information and Media prescribes the extent to which the media outlets meet ethical standards as one of the criteria for receiving co-funding. Media associations also reported irregularities and lack of transparency. Information on other sources of public funding, including advertising, have yet to be made more transparent and comprehensive in the media register. The register does not reveal beneficial ownership for each media, since many owners are listed as subsidiary companies. Supervisory inspections of the register have yet to start.\n\nProfessional organisations and working conditions\n\nThe Press Council continued to effectively monitor print media\u2019s compliance with the Serbian Journalists\u2019 Code of Ethics. In 2024, the Press Council received 88 complaints (125 in 2023) and found in almost all cases that several points of the Code of Ethics had been violated. In February 2025, as part of a larger group of CSOs, a number of media associations announced the suspension of their participation in all government working groups and in the standing working group on the safety of journalists, arguing that the government failed to meet basic democratic standards or the rule of law principles.Journalists and other media professionals have been working in adverse conditions, often without suitable work contracts and unstable financing. Some journalist redundancies, including at the public broadcaster, were reportedly in retaliation for their personal social and political views.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFreedom of assembly and association\n\nWhile the legislation on the freedom of association is adequate, the legal framework governing the freedom of assembly needs to be further aligned with European standards, as Serbia has yet to align further with the joint Venice Commission and OSCE/ODIHR Guidelines on Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and with the Conclusions of the UN Human Rights Committee concerning the notification requirements in the Law on public assembly. Following the tragic incident in Novi Sad, large protests demanding accountability and a more effective fight against corruption took place in various cities, including student blockades of major universities. High-level authorities have attempted to delegitimise the protesters, as well as several media and CSOs, by suggesting, without any evidence, that they are seeking to \u2018destroy Serbia\u2019s constitutional order\u2019 and preparing a foreign-backed and financed \u2018colour revolution\u2019. There were several violent incidents against demonstrators and journalists and, to date, only some perpetrators have been prosecuted, while several others were pardoned from criminal prosecution by the President. Such incidents intensified over the summer, including vandalism and attacks on properties of individuals and businesses seen as supportive of the protests. There were also incidents of attacks against unprotected ruling party premises by violent individuals. As regards the authorities\u2019 handling of protests, cases of excessive use of force by the police, including against journalists and minors, were reported. There were also allegations of the use of toxic CN gas against protestors, which was denied by the Ministry of the Interior, and of unidentified, masked individuals dressed in uniforms resembling the police using force against protesters. \u2018Informative talks\u2019 were held by the Security Intelligence Agency (BIA) with protesters, which were perceived as a form of pressure. Plainclothes police officers arrested protesters and seized and inspected their telephones; previous Ombudsman\u2019s recommendations to wear uniforms with visible police identification have yet to be fully enforced. Overall, several hundreds of individuals were arrested in the context of the protests, and some were detained or put under house arrest. However, few of these cases resulted in indictments. On 29 April 2025, the European Court of Human Rights issued an interim measure in the case concerning the alleged use of a sonic weapon for crowd control by the authorities at demonstrations in Belgrade on 15 March. The Court informed the government that it should prevent any use of sound devices for crowd control (other than for communication purposes). The Court noted that \u2018use of such weapons for crowd control was unlawful in Serbia and, in particular, potentially serious health effects that could be caused to a large number of persons. There was no credible follow-up yet by the authorities which denied such use. A case initiated by the Organised Crime Prosecutor\u2019s Office is ongoing.\n\nLabour and trade union rights are covered in Chapter 19 \u2013 Social policy and employment.\n\nProperty rights\n\nThe legal and institutional framework for enforcing property rights is in place. Enforcement through the judicial and restitution system has been slow and complex in some cases. The Agency for Restitution continued with restitutions in kind of confiscated properties. The government issued bonds when restitution in kind was not possible. Sufficient resources, including allocation of land, need to be secured to facilitate the finalisation of the process.\n\nNon-discrimination\n\nThe legal framework on non-discrimination needs to be further aligned with the EU acquis and European standards, including the Directives on standards for equality bodies.In addition, the legal framework on hate speech and hate crime needs to be aligned with the EU acquis and European standards, including the Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia and the Racial Equality Directive. Serbia needs to consistently implement strategic measures on combating discrimination and racism. Adoption of the 2024-2025 anti-discrimination action plan is seriously delayed. As of August 2025, the Office of the Commissioner for the Protection of Equality had 45 employees out of 60 systematised posts. The procedure for electing a new Commissioner was not initiated by Parliament by the legal deadline. Episodes of incitement to violence or hatred continued to specifically target human rights defenders, Roma, LGBTIQ persons, and migrants. In addition, in her 2024 report, the Commissioner for the Protection of Equality found that unacceptable speech from public officials was a particular problem, as it contributed to the creation of a hostile and offensive environment. Serbia still lacks centralised official data on hate crimes, broken down by bias motivation.\n\nGender equality\n\n![Image 21](blob:http://localhost/b17b55d07d2969dd2bad99577f25e392)The legal framework on gender equality and combating gender-based violence needs to be further aligned with the EU acquis and European standards. Enforcement is insufficient as, in a context of backlash against the concept of gender equality, the law on gender equality has remained suspended since the decision of the Constitutional Court of June 2024 and until the assessment of constitutionality is completed, preventing further progress in this area. In February 2025, Serbia adopted, with delay, a new action plan on the gender equality strategy. More efforts are needed to enforce the legal obligation to include the gender perspective and to remove gender stereotypes from textbooks, challenge stereotypes in the public discourse and collect official sex-disaggregated data. Roma women, older women, poor women, women with disabilities, refugee and internally displaced women continued to experience multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination.\n\n![Image 22](blob:http://localhost/59ddbed170acd5ab7a48145da05c59a3)Violence against women and domestic violence continued to be widespread. Women played a prominent role in protests and were disproportionately exposed to violence, intimidation and targeted attacks. The action plan for the 2021 strategy against violence against women and domestic violence is seriously delayed. Reliable integrated data on cases of gender-based violence, with a breakdown by type of violence (including digital and obstetric) and by relationship between perpetrator and victim, is not available and there are no reliable official statistics on femicides. Data collected by CSOs indicates an increase in the number of murdered women who had previously reported violence. Serbia needs to align with the Directive on combating violence against women and domestic violence and to address the recommendations of the baseline report issued by the Group of Experts on Action against Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (GREVIO) of 2020, which were largely reiterated in GREVIO\u2019s first thematic evaluation report of September 2025. This includes amending the definitions of rape and sexual harassment in the Criminal Code to comply with the Istanbul Convention.The very few support services for victims of gender-based violence and domestic violence are predominantly run by CSOs and operate on a limited budget. The transparency and fairness of public funding in this area need to be significantly improved to address allegations of bias in allocating funding to \u2018governmental non-governmental organisations\u2019 (GONGOs). Police protocols do not mandate cooperation with specialised support services or routine referral of victims, resulting in the underuse of existing CSO expertise. The law against domestic violence does not give women CSOs a standard role in drawing up individual protection plans, as recommended by GREVIO, but leaves their participation to the discretion of the relevant prosecutor\u2019s office. The legal provision offering victims the option to participate in the creation of individual protection plans needs to be enforced. Safe houses lack staffing and adequate funding. Attention needs to be paid to ensuring equal access for all women, including refugee and migrant women, transgender women and women from other marginalised groups.\n\nRights of the child\n\nThe legal framework on the rights of the child needs to be further aligned with the EU acquis and European standards, including the European Commission Recommendation on integrated child protection, and enforcement needs to be improved. Serbia has yet to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child\u2019s third optional protocol on a communication procedure. Many children joined the protests, which the authorities criticised despite the Convention on the Rights of the Child guaranteeing children the rights to freedom of assembly and expression in a safe and peaceful manner. In October 2024, Serbia adopted a special protocol for the protection of children from violence in the field of social protection; other sectoral protocols in education, health, judiciary and police have yet to be adopted. A new strategy related to violence against children has yet to be adopted as the previous strategy expired in 2023 and no national action plan for the rights of the child is in place. The Council on the rights of the child did not meet in 2024 and, to date, in 2025. It has yet to be supported by a technical body and a cross-sectoral group. The Law against domestic violence needs to be amended to ensure that every child who is a witness or victim of domestic violence is included in the court\u2019s individual protection plan. Serbia needs to amend its family law to explicitly prohibit corporal punishment of children in the family and to ban child marriage. A new Law on juvenile offenders and the protection of minors in criminal proceedings has yet to be adopted to ensure child-friendly court procedures and equal access to justice for all children. Statistical data on vulnerable groups is still needed, with a breakdown by age and sex and including Roma children and children with disabilities. Although relatively few children are placed in institutional care(under 100 children per 100 000 children), violations of child rights in large-scale institutions remain a concern.Children with disabilities, who are vulnerable to multiple forms of exclusion and abuse, constitute the largest group of children in institutions as they are over-represented (70%) among children living in residential large-scale institutions. Serbia does not fully enforce the legal ban on placing children below three years of age in residential care.\n\nPersons with disabilities\n\nThe legal framework on the rights of persons with disabilities needs to be further aligned with the EU acquis and European standards, including the European Accessibility Act and the Commission Guidance on independent living and inclusion in the community of persons with disabilities in the context of EU funding. Enforcement mechanisms need to be improved.In January 2025, Serbia adopted the strategy and action plan in this area. Serbia has yet to adopt implementing legislation for the Law on temporary social care residents. There is still no legal basis ensuring that placement decisions in care homes are subject to regular court reviews. Deprivation of legal capacity procedures need to be changed to strengthen the position of the individuals concerned,as noted in the 2022 CPT report. Amendments to the family law to abolish the existing system of complete deprivation of legal capacity have yet to be adopted. The delay in adopting the action plan for the 2022 strategy on deinstitutionalisation is an increasing concern. There was no substantive progress in developing sustainable community-based services. Women with disabilities in residential institutions continued to face gender-specific forms of violence. The Commissioner for the Protection of Equality published the first Special Report on Disability-Based Discrimination, with a particular emphasis on intersectionality, accessibility and the denial of reasonable accommodation in employment.\n\nLGBTIQ persons\n\nThe legal protection of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ) persons needs to be improved. Serbia needs to consistently implement strategic measures on combating discrimination and strengthening the rights of LGBTIQ persons, who continued to face high levels of discrimination A pride event took place in Belgrade in September 2025. The withdrawal of U.S. funding led to a significant reduction of CSOs activities, including the provision of legal and psycho-social support to LGBTIQ persons. There were no developments on the draft law on same-sex partnerships, nor on the regulation of legal gender recognition, as already planned in the previous anti-discrimination strategy. Serbia needs to align with the EU acquis and ECtHR case law in this area. Difficulties remain,especially in smaller municipalities, in implementing amendments to the Law on birth registry, which enable data on gender changes to be entered into the registry. The implementation of legislation combating hate crime, including on grounds of sexual orientation, remains inadequate. LGBTIQ persons, and in particular transgender persons, are vulnerable to hate speech, violence, abuse and discrimination. Due to a lack of trust in institutions and fear of secondary victimisation, cases of violence and discrimination towards LGBTIQ persons are often unreported. Intersex persons remain invisible both socially and legally.\n\nProcedural rights and victims\u2019 rights\n\nThe legal framework on procedural rights for suspects and accused as well as the rights of victims of crime needs to be further aligned with the EU acquis. A victim support coordinator was appointed at the Ministry of Justice. In December 2024, the High Judicial Council adopted a rulebook on the operation of victim and witness support services and focal points to provide information to victims and witnesses, paving the way to uniform services across the high courts. While such services have been set up in 15 high courts, a nation-wide victim support service is not yet in place and specific human and financial resources are still needed. Continued investments are needed to equip high courts with special equipment and separate rooms so that victims do not face their perpetrators during proceedings. An effective referral mechanism is lacking. Although CSOs provide the bulk of specialised victim support, they still lack sufficient and sustained financing. Regarding access to justice, there is a need for stronger financial support at state level, greater capacity of local self-governments to handle legal aid requests and further attention to women\u2019s access to justice in all cases of gender-based violence and discrimination. An analysis of the necessary amendments to the Law on free legal aid was finalised but its adoption is delayed.\n\nProtection of minorities\n\nSerbia\u2019s institutional framework for the protection of persons belonging to minorities is incomplete as a new action plan is seriously delayed. Persons belonging to minorities continued to face discrimination. Serbia needs to take into account the new, fifth opinion issued by the Advisory Committee of the Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities (FCNM) when finalising the new action plan, in inclusive consultations with national minorities. The proper functioning and independence of national minority councils remains important. Members of the Albanian national minority continued to raise concerns about the way police were checking residence status in south Serbia, resulting in the \u2018passivisation\u2019 of certain addresses. There is a need for the authorities to better explain to the public how these checks are being conducted and to address the concerns expressed in the fifth opinion over the reported lack of effective remedies. The \u2018action plan for improvements in the representation of Albanians in institutions\u2019 has not yet delivered measurable outcomes. National minorities remain underrepresented in public administration and the police. The Ministry of Education allocated funding for the printing of new textbooks in minority languages; this work needs to be further intensified. Although teaching Serbian as a non-mother tongue continued, the FCNM Advisory Committee underlined the importance of developing targeted measures to improve official language learning, in light of the limited proficiency of some national minorities. Access to religious worship in minority languages has yet to be enabled throughout Serbia. Public broadcasting services in mi nority languages are still not sufficient, except for some local broadcasters in Vojvodina. Hateful rhetoric against national minorities in the media and by politicians continued.\n\nRoma\n\nThe institutional framework on Roma is incomplete as a new action plan is pending, and Roma people continued to face discrimination.An ex post analysis of the action plan for Roma inclusion for 2022-2024 was developed and a new action plan needs to be prepared and adopted. R obust monitoring and data collection are needed to meet the commitments made in the Poznan Declaration. Job descriptions for local Roma coordinators, pedagogical assistants and health mediators have not been aligned, and contracts are signed with limited duration. Most Roma people in Serbia have civil documentation. Th e procedure for registering all births, regardless of the parents\u2019 status, needs to be implemented effectively and monitored. Roma pupils continued to receive scholarships through affirmative measures. However, school dropout rates remain high, especially for Roma girls. Roma pupils are still over-represented in special-needs schools and classes. The transition from education to the labour market is particularly challenging. Roma people are still underrepresented in the public administration. Forced evictions are still taking place, in breach of the law and international standards. The FCNM Advisory Committee stressed that no evictions should take place without adequate notice and without providing effective opportunities for rehousing in decent, affordable accommodation. Early and child marriage remains an issue of concern among Roma girls living in settlements. Domestic violence also often goes unreported.\n\nRefugees and internally displaced persons\n\nAs of July 2024, there were 194 171 internationally displaced persons (IDPs) in Serbia, according to official data by the Serbian authorities, of whom 68 500 still have displacement-related needs and are among the most vulnerable segments of the population. In November 2024, Serbia adopted a new strategy to resolve issues related to refugees and IDPs. Solutions for Roma IDPs remain slow and limited, requiring more funding.\n\nCitizenship rights\n\nSerbia will need to ensure that the EU acquis on EU citizenship rights, notably the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, can be applied upon accession.\n\n2.2.2 Chapter 24: Justice, freedom and security\n\nThe EU has common rules for border and migration management, visa policy, and asylum.. Schengen cooperation entails the lifting of border controls inside the EU. There is also cooperation in the fight against serious and organised crime and terrorism, and judicial, police and customs cooperation, all with the support of the EU Justice and Home Affairs agencies.\n\nFight against serious and organised crime\n\nThe legal framework on serious and organised crime is partially aligned with the EU acquis.\n\nThe capacity to fight against serious and organised crime needs to be improved.\n\nLegal alignment, strategic and institutional frameworks\n\nThe 2024-2027 national Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment (SOCTA) provides the operational priorities for fighting serious and organised crime. A new Director of Police was appointed in April 2025. The position had been vacant since December 2021. The Prosecutor\u2019s Office for Organised Crime (POOC) and the Special Prosecutor\u2019s Office for Cybercrime lack sufficient human, material and technical resources to carry out their tasks. In 2024, the number of public prosecutors in the POOC was reduced, leaving six out of 25 positions vacant. The POOC and the police lack the technical resources to carry out special investigative measures without the help of the Security Information Agency (BIA). The police services still lack a shared case / workflow management system, connecting all institutions and giving them access to a common database. Serbia should continue to work towards ensuring a fully operational national criminal intelligence system and make the Asset Recovery Office fully operational.\n\nT he operational autonomy of the police from the Ministry of the Interior during the pre-investigation and investigation phases to be fully accountable only to the prosecutor is still not established either in law or in practice. A new Law on internal affairs has yet to be adopted to address this issue and the recommendations of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT). Serbia should adopt amendments to the Law on organisation and competence of state authorities in suppression of organised crime, terrorism and corruption to improve the institutional set-up in the fight against organised crime. Serbia should also put in place an anti-corruption strategy for the police to strengthen anti-corruption measures.\n\nSerbia should phase out the role of the security services in investigations of serious and organised crime cases. Legislative changes should be made to limit the role of BIA and the Military Security Agency to national security threats and remove their involvement in criminal proceedings. A clear separation needs to be made between the remits and regulations for criminal investigations and for security purposes.\n\nIn November 2024, Serbia amended t he Law on the freezing of assets, with the aim of preventing terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to fulfil the Financial Action Task Force recommendations. Amendments to the Law on the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of crime have been prepared. A strategic-operational plan for the prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and financing of the proliferation of weapons for mass destruction (2025-2029) was adopted in April 2025 (see also chapter 4 \u2013 Free movement of capital).\n\n\n![Image 23](blob:http://localhost/5e2e584a3afec8ae862145bbd49ccd01)The Law on the prevention and combating of trafficking in human beings and the protection of victims has been prepared but remains to be adopted. While CSOs are the primary providers of support for victims of trafficking, they still lack sufficient and sustained financing. Implementation of the programme for the fight against human trafficking (2024-2027) is ongoing. Coordination among institutions at national and local levels should be further increased.\n\nAmendments to the Criminal Code are being prepared with the aim of effectively criminalising the trafficking of weapons. The new Law on weapons and ammunitions and the programme on the control of small arms and light weapons and its action plan for the period 2025-2030 have yet to be adopted. The Firearms Focal Point remained fully operational. Serbia\u2019s proof house for testing firearms and ammunition joined the Commission Internationale Permanents pour l\u2019\u00e9preuve des armes \u00e0 feu portatives (CIP) in December 2024.\n\nImplementation and enforcement capacity\n\n![Image 24](blob:http://localhost/159cf227d4d29c3490d84adda812099e)In 2024, although there was a decrease in the number of individuals indicted for organised crime, there was an increase in the number of individuals convicted and of individuals under investigation. The use of plea agreements needs to be carefully balanced against the need to avoid any impression of impunity in serious and organised crime cases. Serbia should increase the number of proactive investigations, based on intelligence-led policing, focusing on high-profile cases aiming at dismantling big and international criminal organisations.\n\nFinancial investigations are still not conducted consistently and systematically when investigating serious and organised crime, including money laundering, illicit trafficking and terrorism. Proactive financial investigations are needed, including a systematic tracking of money flows, to be able to identify more criminal assets, uncover illegal financial schemes, increase confiscation and gather circumstantial evidence of inexplicable wealth. In 2024, financial investigations were initiated in 11 9 cases of serious and organised crime.\n\nCooperation with CEPOL, Eurojust, Europol and Interpol continued, leading to arrests in serious and organised crime cases and to the disruption of organised criminal groups. In 2024, a total of 13 672 messages were exchanged via the Secure Information Exchange Network Application (SIENA) (up from 10 098 in 2023). Serbia continued to actively participate in the European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats (EMPACT), taking part in 73 operational actions (up from 64 in 2023), including four as action co-leader. In the fight against money laundering and following indictments by the Prosecutor\u2019s Office for Organised Crime, eight individuals were convicted in 2024 (five in 2023). In 2024, 94 individuals were convicted (final decision) for money laundering in courts of general jurisdiction (see also Chapter 4 \u2013 Free movement of capital).\n\nThe specialised police department for combating high-tech crime continued to conduct investigations on the darknet to identify illegal content, illicit trade and various malware services. Serbia played an active role in international operations aimed at combating cybercrime, including online child sexual exploitation.\n\n![Image 25](blob:http://localhost/765e4c86d9d4d55efb6be7eef9cbd20a)Of the total 34 convictions for trafficking in human beings, seven individuals were convicted in the context of organised crime and 27 under general jurisdiction. Serbia should take further steps to support and protect victims of trafficking in human beings,including proper protection during trials, and to improve the investigation, prosecution and adjudication of trafficking cases, in particular for the purpose of labour exploitation. Given the migratory flows through its territory, Serbia needs to build the capacity to detect and identify possible third-country victims of trafficking in human beings, including through the abuse of visa-free regimes. In 2024, the Centre for protection of victims of human trafficking identified 71 victims (66 in 2023). Serbia\u2019s participation in EMPACT is a key instrument for responding to trafficking in human beings. Serbia has demonstrated a strong commitment in combatting trafficking in human beings by participating in 11 EMPACT operational actions out of 22, including the Global Chain.\n\nContinued efforts are needed to prevent the storage, sale and ownership of illegal firearms, registration and destruction of surrendered weapon and arms\u2019 trafficking. In 2024, Serbia seized 1 100 pieces of firearms, 35 325 pieces of ammunition and 5 360 grams of explosives. The capacity of law enforcement bodies to handle cases of gender-based violence and their victims should be improved.\n\nCooperation in the field of drugs\n\nThe legal framework for cooperation in the field of drugs needs to be improved.\n\nLegal alignment, strategic and institutional frameworks\n\n\nThe national drug strategy expired in 2021, and Serbia has not yet adopted the Operational Plan for the Prevention of Drug Abuse for 2024-2027. Serbia has a well-established national early-warning system that continued to liaise with the EU Drugs Agency (EUDA) on psychoactive substances and trends. The list of psychoactive controlled substances continued to be updated, and Serbia\u2019s National Drugs Observatory remained operational.\n\nImplementation and enforcement capacity\n\n![Image 27](blob:http://localhost/505441ceb7381198fbeda3df3ecbf9f7)Of the 900 final convictions in 2024 for drug production and trafficking, 35 were in the context of organised crime. Serbia played an active role in numerous EMPACT operations aimed at combating drug trafficking.\n\nThere is a high level of cooperation between the EUDA and Serbia. Serbia submitted a national drug situation review including data that are largely aligned with EU standards.\n\nFight against terrorism and the prevention of radicalisation and violent extremism\n\nThe legal framework for the fight against terrorism is largely aligned with the EU acquis. The fight against terrorism is broadly satisfactory.\n\nThe legal framework for countering violent extremism is partially aligned with the EU acquis. The countering of violent extremism, i n particular ethnonationalism and violent right-wing extremism, needs to be improved.\n\nThe legal framework for critical infrastructure protection and the resilience of critical entities is not aligned with the EU acquis. The protection of critical infrastructure and the resilience of critical entities needs to be improved.\n\nLegal alignment, strategic and institutional frameworks\n\nSerbia did not further align its legal framework with the EU acquis on the fight against terrorism and prevention of radicalisation and violent extremism.\n\nSerbia has yet to adopt the programme for preventing and combating terrorism and all forms of radicalisation and violent extremism for the period 2025-2030 and the accompanying action plan. The previous strategy expired in 2021. A National Coordinator and the National Coordination Body for the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism have been in place since July 2023.\n\nImplementation and enforcement capacity\n\nSerbia made limited progress in implementing the EU-Western Balkans Joint Action Plan (JAP) on Counterterrorism. The national database for the prevention and fight against terrorism has been operational since June 2023.\n\nIn 2024, there was one conviction for terrorist offences and the Prosecutors\u2019 Office for Organised Crime filed seven indictments. A growing concern is the increasing presence of right-wing extremist content online, along with hateful content and disinformation.\n\nSerbia actively participated in Europol analysis projects falling under the European Counter Terrorism Centre and in international operations supported by Europol aiming at countering terrorist content online (i.e. Referral Action Days) and CEPOL activities. Serbia should integrate the knowledge and competencies gained through CEPOL trainings into its law enforcement training system. Serbia also took part in several Interpol operations and projects as well as the Council of Europe Network of Contact Points on Foreign Terrorist Fighters.\n\nPre-investigative action was taken to discover and prove the financing of terrorism (140 individuals, one legal entity and two citizens\u2019 associations were checked). There were no final convictions for financing of terrorism. Serbia should speed up the process of identifying critical infrastructure and aim to align its legislation with the Directive on critical entities resilience.\n\nJudicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters\n\nJudicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters is broadly satisfactory.\n\n\nSerbia continued reporting on implementation of the 2007 Hague Convention on Child Support , in force since February 2021. Serbia still needs to accede to two core instruments under the Hague conference of private international law: the 2000 Hague Convention on the International Protection of Adults and the 2019 Hague Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgements in Civil or Commercial Matters.\n\n![Image 29](blob:http://localhost/84d0de88223c7d8687bd0dd869956d75)The average duration of the procedure for providing mutual legal assistance (MLA) was 499 days in civil matters and 470 days in criminal matters. Regulatory and administrative capacity measures should be taken to improve efficiency and timeliness for executing mutual legal assistance requests. Eurojust and Serbia have continued their good cooperation in criminal matters through the Serbian Liaison Prosecutor. From 1 March 2024 to 31 July 2025, Serbia participated in 130 new cases at Eurojust, of which 60 were opened at the request of the Serbian Liaison Prosecutor. The majority of cases related to organised crime, drug trafficking, money-laundering and fraud. Three new joint investigation teams were created related to organised crime and drug trafficking, in addition to the five from the previous period.\n\nThe Supreme Public Prosecution Office was active in cooperating with the European Judicial Network. The working arrangement on cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office (EPPO), which has been pending since 2023, has still not been finalised. In 2024, EPPO sent three requests for mutual legal assistance to Serbia.\n\nLegal and irregular migration\n\nThe legal framework for management of legal and irregular migration is partially aligned with the EU acquis.\n\nThe management of legal and irregular migration is broadly satisfactory.\n\nLegal alignment, strategic and institutional frameworks\n\n![Image 30](blob:http://localhost/6becd750e39c112b50770393d51835ba)The legislative framework for the management of external borders is largely aligned with the EU acquis. However, further alignment and better implementation is still needed to ensure efficient and systematic registration of irregular migrants.\n\nSerbia contributed to the management of mixed migration flows to the EU and continued to implement the EU Action Plan on the Western Balkans. Further alignment with EU visa policy and additional progress under all pillars in the Action Plan is expected, in particular action to improve the efficiency of the asylum system.\n\nIn March 2024, Serbia adopted a decision on providing temporary protection to all people having fled Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine. This provides the legal basis for further extensions.\n\nIn terms of combating irregular migration, implementation of the integrated border management strategy (2022-2027) and accompanying action plan (2022-2024) is delayed. Serbia has not yet adopted the next action plan for the period 2025-2027.\n\nAs an observer in the European Migration Network, Serbia is included in the Asylum and Migration Overview of EU Member States and observer countries.\n\nImplementation and enforcement capacity\n\nSerbia continues to host a substantial number of third-country nationals with EU support.\n\nThe EU-Serbia readmission agreement continued to be implemented. In November 2024, Serbia signed a readmission agreement with Kazakhstan. Negotiations on readmission agreements are ongoing with Iceland, Ukraine, T\u00fcrkiye and efforts to establish cooperation on legal migration and on readmission are ongoing with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. Serbia should ensure that legal pathways developed for third-country nationals entering Serbia prevent secondary movements to the EU.\n\nSerbia continued to intensify border controls and police operations targeting migrant smugglers. For the second consecutive year, the number of irregular movements through Serbia fell substantially from the previous year (43 474 in 2023 to 14 029 in 2024) and Serbia recorded the lowest number of migrants accommodated in reception and asylum centres since 2015. Due to this significant decrease, the Commissariat for Refugees and Migration continued to reduce the number of operational reception and asylum centres (6 operational out of 17), in accordance with the response plan for the management of mixed migration flows. While the lower occupancy rate helped improve conditions in some reception facilities, reduced reception capacities increased the risk of migrants moving faster and undetected through the country and without access to essential reception and protection services. A contingency plan is in place in case there is a sudden increase in migration flows. Overall, reception capacities are adequate.\n\nIn 2024, Serbia conducted new investigations in 306 smuggling of migrant cases and filed indictments against 381 defendants. The police operation launched in 2023 and intensified controls targeting smugglers and migrants illegally present in the country continued in 2024.\n\n![Image 31](blob:http://localhost/8926f78e051356f475477e6b367f1fe1)Serbia continues to take part in the Global Alliance to Counter Migrant Smuggling and is invited to renew its engagement at the occasion of the Global Alliance's second conference scheduled to take place end of 2025.\n\nAsylum\n\nThe management of asylum needs to be improved.\n\nLegal alignment, strategic and institutional frameworks\n\nSerbia\u2019s legal framework is largely aligned with the EU acquis, but further alignment and better implementation of current legislation is still needed to ensure fair and fast asylum processing.\n\nSerbia should revise the Law on asylum and temporary protection to further align it with the EU acquis, notably on effective access to the procedure, appeal bodies, rights and obligations of applicants/people under international protection, free legal aid and on the safe third-country procedure.\n\nSerbia has the institutions needed to manage asylum applications. The third roadmap for cooperation (2024-2026) with the European Union Agency for Asylum (EUAA) has been developed but final endorsement of the roadmap is still pending.\n\nAmendments to the Law on employment of foreigners facilitate access to employment for refugees and asylum seekers in Serbia. For example, it shortens the period for asylum seekers to access the labour market from nine to six months from the date of their asylum application. As of February 2024, the Asylum Office issued 51 travel documents to refugees, with the assistance of the EU.\n\nImplementation and enforcement capacity\n\n![Image 32](blob:http://localhost/303417f251d9e480ec0a18e7b5e3526f)There were fewer asylum seekers in 2024 compared with previous years. Out of the 847 individuals (against 1 654 in 2023 and 4 155 in 2022) who expressed their intention to seek asylum, only 219 lodged an asylum application. The absconding rate remained high at over 50%. The asylum recognition rate was very low. In 2024, only four asylum seekers received refugee status, three received subsidiary protection while 79 had their request denied.\n\nIn 2024, Serbia granted 375 Ukrainian citizens temporary protection and extended protection for 707 people.\n\nThe quality of asylum decisions needs to be further improved. Efforts have been made to develop country-of-origin information functions within the Asylum Department. The Asylum Commission and the Administrative Court should review the Asylum Office\u2019s decisions more effectively and based on merit. Further advanced training is needed. The state-funded free legal aid mechanism in the asylum procedure needs to be improved.\n\nSerbia has the basic legal framework for integration in place, including good practice for individual integration plans. However, the quality of ID documents to facilitate access to socio-economic rights and services, and the predictability and scope of integration schemes (e.g. for the acquisition of skills, language proficiency, and integration of persons with disabilities) continue to be major obstacles to integration.\n\nVisa policy\n\nVisa policy is not fully aligned with EU policy, in particular concerning the list of countries whose nationals require a visa to enter the EU. In December 2024, the Serbian government abolished the visa exemptions for Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and Mongolia nationals. Serbia\u2019s list of visa-free countries still differs by 12 countries. Serbia\u2019s visa issuing system is partially in line with the EU Visa Code.\n\nIn 2024, Serbia further tightened its requirements for obtaining entry visas. A more rigorous screening of visa-free arrivals of third-country nationals is necessary, in particular of arrivals from countries presenting security or irregular migration risks.\n\nIn May 2025, Serbia launched a new digital platform for travel authorisations as a pilot phase in the digitalisation of its visa application and approval procedure. The platform currently covers 42 countries which are visa required in Serbia and where Serbia lacks consular representation. Of these, 16 countries are also visa-required in the EU. Serbia should therefore ensure appropriate safeguards and security checks when processing the travel authorisations from these countries. At this stage, the platform applies exclusively to tourist visas and short-term stays.\n\nAccording to Eurostat, 3 270 Serbian nationals applied for asylum in the EU 27 in 2024 (against 4 695 in 2023).\n\nThe acquisition of visa-free travel rights to the EU for Russian nationals by granting them Serbian citizenship poses potential security risks for the EU. R igorous security screening should apply when granting Serbian citizenship to Russian nationals, since Serbian passport holders benefits from visa-free travel to the EU.\n\nSchengen governance and external borders\n\nThe legislative framework for the management of external borders is largely aligned with the EU acquis. The management of borders is broadly satisfactory.\n\nLegal alignment, strategic and institutional frameworks\n\nContinued efforts are needed to align with and implement the EU acquis. Issues relating to national borders are governed by the Law on border control.\n\nSerbian authorities have well-established cooperation with the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex). As of September 2025, 159 standing corps officers are deployed at Serbia\u2019s borders with North Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and at the international airport in Belgrade, in addition to Hungary and Bulgaria. The new status agreement between the EU and Serbia entered into force on 1 April 2025 and renewal of the Ministry of Interior\u2019s working arrangement with Frontex is ongoing. Serbia has also invited Frontex to extend its operations along the borders with Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, and those deployments are expected in the last quarter of 2025.\n\nImplementation of the integrated border management (IBM) action plan (2022-2024) is delayed and should be followed up more effectively by the coordination body in charge of monitoring the activities and results. The subsequent action plan for the period 2025-2027 has been prepared but has not yet been adopted.\n\nImplementation of the Schengen acquis is supported by the Schengen action plan. Given the need to reinforce and establish a solid foundation for the Schengen system, an action plan for the accession of Serbia to the Schengen area was adopted in July 2023, and implementation is ongoing.\n\nImplementation and enforcement capacity\n\nSignificant investment is needed in human, financial and technical resources for border control (second-line checks, border surveillance and equipment for the detection of forged documents), and in infrastructure at border crossing points, in line with EU Schengen requirements. A national coordination centre is not yet established.Inter-agency cooperation is satisfactory between border police and customs at border crossing points. Further improvements are needed on information exchange by enabling mutual access to databases and a formalised and secure information exchange system. Serbia should also increase the capacity of all stakeholders in IBM to achieve interoperability with EU border management information systems. Serbia should step up action to implement the Directive on the obligation of carriers to communicate advance passenger information and the Directive on the use of passenger name record data for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime.\n\nIn January 2025, several foreign civil society representatives (including from EU Member States) were detained and expelled from Serbia. Some were subsequently banned from entering the country on the grounds of representing a \u2018security risk\u2019. Furthermore, in March 2025, several foreign journalists, including from EU Member States, were denied entry into Serbia and some EU citizens legally residing in Serbia had their residence status removed and were asked to leave the country at short notice (see Freedom of expression).\n\nBased on the Police Cooperation Convention for Southeast Europe (PCC SEE), the Ministry of Interior established cooperation with all neighbouring countries. Joint patrols continued with Hungary, North Macedonia and Romania.\n\nThe interim common crossing points (CCPs) between Kosovo and Serbia remain operational. Only two of the six permanent CCPs have been established (Merdare and Mutivod\u00eb/Mutivode). Serbia still needs to establish permanent CCPs hosted on their side (Jarinje/Rudnica, Kon\u010dulj/Dheu i Bardh\u00eb and Depce/Mu\u00e7ibab\u00eb), which led to a suspension of EU funds for a project in July 2018. In addition, Serbia needs to engage constructively to enable the construction of the CCP hosted by Kosovo in the north of Kosovo at Tabavije/B\u00ebrnjak-Tabalije/Brnjak. Urgent action is required from Serbia to close illegal roads and bypasses to ensure exclusive use of official crossing points for goods and people entering or leaving Kosovo.\n\nAn anti-corruption preventive mechanism for authorities involved in IBM has been adopted, but further efforts are still needed at regional and local level.\n\nSerbia needs to continue building the capacity needed to conduct returns of migrants with no legal right to stay to their countries of origin, both for forced and voluntary returns, in a manner fully compliant with fundamental rights and international law.\n\nCounterfeiting of the euro (criminal law aspect)\n\nSerbia\u2019s legislation on the suppression of counterfeit currency is largely aligned with the EU acquis.\n\n\n2.3. Economic criteria\n\n![Image 33](blob:http://localhost/7dc1a11ff77d1616a0c72efcc5a433d8)\n\n2.3.1. The existence of a functioning market economy\n\nEconomic governance\n\nSerbia remained committed to maintaining macroeconomic stability. Serbia\u2019s 24-month stand-by arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was successfully concluded in December 2024. It was replaced by a 36-month Policy Coordination Instrument (PCI), under which Serbia commits to continue to implement important reforms regarding SOE governance, the public-sector wage system, fiscal transparency, public investment management and energy sector reforms. The government\u2019s current fiscal strategy (2025-2027) targets an increased deficit of 3.0% of GDP in every single year, which is higher than the ceiling set in the fiscal rules.\n\n![Image 34](blob:http://localhost/224b5c5a90ea0b210e5035af1a77a731)Serbia has partially implemented the policy guidance set out in the conclusions of the May 2024 Economic and Financial Dialogue. Serbia has achieved good progress notably in achieving a sufficiently tight monetary policy stance, continuing action to promote the use of the domestic currency and creating a bank resolution fund. However, only partial progress was made on the public-sector wage reform, fiscal risk analysis and reporting, implementation of the new SOE Law and on strengthening medium-term budgeting.\n\nMacroeconomic stability\n\nFollowing last year\u2019s strong growth, economic activity slowed down at the beginning of 2025. In 2024, GDP growth reached 3.9%, slightly higher than the average growth rate of 3.6% between 2019 and 2023, driven by buoyant investment and rising consumer spending. Consumer spending was supported by higher real disposable income resulting from rapid real wage growth, while investment was boosted by strong inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2024 and an ambitious public investment programme. In line with the strong increase in domestic demand, the contribution of net exports to GDP growth was negative as import growth far exceeded exports. However, the ongoing domestic political turmoil, weak demand from main EU trading partners, and intensified global trade tensions dampened economic sentiment, notably in the first half of 2025, and resulted in GDP growth decelerating to only about 2% in the first two quarters of 2025. The income gap with the EU average continued to narrow slightly in 2024, with GDP per capita in purchasing power standards reaching 51% of the EU average, up from 42% in 2019.\n\n![Image 35](blob:http://localhost/003eb761d6e373c1009e804c5785da63)In line with surges in investment and spending, the current account deficit widened considerably in 2024. After falling to 2.4% of GDP in 2023, the external deficit rose to 4.7% of GDP in 2024 as both the trade and the primary income balance deteriorated notably. In the second quarter of 2025, the current account deficit rose further to 6.3% of GDP due to the large negative goods trade balance only partly offset by the surplus in trade in services, supported by ICT and business service exports. At the same time, the growing stock of FDI resulted in higher outflows of dividend and interest payments, while remittances decreased. The current account deficit was fully offset by net FDI inflows in 2024, reaching 5.6% of GDP. However, FDI fell by over half in the first six months of 2025 compared with the same period in 2024, but the fall is from record-high levels. Official foreign exchange reserves peaked at the end of 2024 at 35.6% of GDP, covering 7.3 months of goods and services imports, before subsiding in early 2025. External debt remained stable at 60.6% of GDP in 2024, slightly below the average of 62.6% between 2019 and 2023.\n\nMonetary policy remained relatively tight in 2024, which helped inflation return to within the central bank\u2019s target band (3\u00b11.5%) in mid-2024. Down from 12.1% in 2023, inflation averaged 4.7% in 2024 but continued to hover around the upper bound of the target band in the second half of 2024. It bottomed at 3.8% in May 2025, but has since accelerated to 4.7% in August, notably driven by food prices. After lowering the key policy rate in the second half of 2024 in three steps to 5.75%, the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) has refrained from further easing of monetary conditions as domestic price pressures remain high. The NBS maintained exchange rate stability but switched to being a net seller on the local FX market in the first half of 2025 due to the deteriorating external position.\n\n![Image 36](blob:http://localhost/ecc9c4c865e45a070294da74f858afa5)The general government deficit turned out lower than planned in 2024, at 2.0% of GDP. Compared with 2023 figures, both revenue and expenditure increased by 1.5 percentage points (pps) of GDP, resulting in a minor improvement of the deficit vis-\u00e0-vis 2023 and a continuation of the positive trend in the balance since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Revenues were mostly boosted by social contributions and personal income tax, driven by rises in wages and employment. Capital spending increased by 0.9 pps to 7.3% of GDP, while current spending on pensions (up 0.8 pps) and wages (up 0.6 pps), also saw notable increases. However, these were in line with the special fiscal rules capping pension and wage expenditure at 10% of GDP each. The level of subsidies remained relatively high at 2.5% of GDP. The primary balance was slightly negative. The public debt-to-GDP ratio declined to 47.5% from 48.4% in 2023. In October 2024, S&P Global Ratings upgraded Serbia\u2019s short- and long-term foreign and local currency credit rating, which resulted in the country\u2019s first-ever investment grade rating.\n\nThe fiscal governance framework, while well-designed, risks being undermined by the decision to postpone the full application of the fiscal rules. Serbia adopted a new set of fiscal rules in December 2022, with the deficit component set to enter into force in 2025. However, in late 2024, specific new deficit targets were agreed with the IMF under the PCI. The fiscal deficits are thereafter in practice anchored by the IMF program, as the application of the deficit rule will be de facto postponed until 2029, while the fiscal rule component on pension and public wage growth is still in place. Budgetary practices need improvements, notably as regards the budget procedure, including for amending budgets. Serbia used the fast-track procedure again to adopt the 2024 supplementary budget. Similarly, the contingency reserve, (which is relatively high against an international comparison) allows for substantial ad hoc spending decisions during the year. The reserve lacks clearly defined restrictions on the use of ad hoc decisions and is often spent in an untransparent way. The Fiscal Council continued to monitor fiscal policies, producing independent reports and recommendations.\n\nOverall, the macroeconomic policy mix was appropriate, although the plan to loosen the fiscal stance in 2025 somewhat contradicts the efforts to combat inflation. Under current projections, the more expansionary fiscal policy is still set to result in a sustainable fiscal position as public debt is projected to decline gradually. However, the decision to weaken the fiscal targets appears pro-cyclical in the context of a projected economic upswing in the coming years. Maintaining fiscal discipline would be important to manage inflationary risks. Monetary policy has been appropriately tight, given the persisting domestic inflationary pressure.\n\nFunctioning of product markets\n\nBusiness environment\n\nDespite progress in reducing the regulatory and administrative burden on businesses, there are still weaknesses that affect small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular. The business environment is hampered by red tape, political interference, weaknesses in the rule of law and limited efficiency and transparency of the public administration. The Law on foreign exchange transactions is too restrictive and not applied consistently. Serbia ranked 105 th out of 180 countries in the 2024 corruption perception index by Transparency International, continuing the negative trend since 2016. Efforts to reduce the size of the informal economy continued, but several factors favour its persistence: high taxes and social security contributions on the lowest salaries, parafiscal (non-tax) charges, red tape and shortcomings in addressing corruption. In addition, there is insufficient capacity in key inspection departments. Further efforts are needed to improve the quality, independence and efficiency of the justice system.\n\nState influence on product markets\n\nThe state has significantly intervened in the product markets. The government announced in August 2025 a major new intervention into the domestic trade of many basic goods, taking effect abruptly on 1 September 2025 for the following 6 months, with no meaningful prior consultation with stakeholders. The measure caps margins for the largest retailers, wholesalers and distributors to a maximum of 20% of purchase price for a large number of products, such as most food categories and household cleaning and personal hygiene products, cosmetics, etc. While it is intended to benefit consumers and contain inflation, the measure risks disrupting the business operations of retailers and the whole supply chain and could negatively impact investment and business climate. The legal framework for competition and State aid is broadly in line with the EU acquis, but greater alignment is needed with implementing legislation and to make implementation systematic. The Commission for Protection of Competition (CPC) and the Commission for State Aid Control (CSAC) are legally independent bodies. However, the operational independence of the CSAC needs to be demonstrated. State aid rules are not always implemented due to strong political pressure to provide financial assistance to SOEs and large foreign investors, which has a significant impact on competition. State aid is not sufficiently transparent, including in the 2025 budget. In addition, temporary ad hoc trade restrictions continue to be brought in at very short notice and without clear justification, with negative impacts on both local and foreign companies. Public investment management and public procurement procedures still use exemptions from standard procedures, undermining the attainment of a unified and transparent system for investment planning and management and preventing fair competition.\n\nPrivatisation and restructuring\n\nThe state still plays a major role in the economy, which hampers competition and the development of the private sector. Serbia\u2019s SOEs still operate in many structurally important sectors including energy, transport, manufacturing, telecommunications and finance, and employ a large share of Serbia\u2019s workforce.Their outsized presence affects resource allocation and impedes overall competitiveness while also posing a major risk for public finances. Steps have been taken to improve SOE governance through the 2021-2027 strategy on state ownership and management of SOEs and the Law on SOE governance, which entered into force in September 2024, and a number of related secondary laws. However, practical improvements have so far been limited. Many SOEs still do not apply proper corporate governance rules and continue to operate inefficiently. They often rely on direct or indirect government subsidies and are subject to strong political influence. The issue of appointing temporary managers for extended periods (against the rules) has yet to be addressed in practice. It is critical to finalise and operationalise the implementing legislation without delay, to ensure its application in practice, and make sure that the institutions responsible for doing so have sufficient administrative capacity.\n\nFunctioning of the financial market\n\nThe banking sector remained stable in the reporting period. The sector\u2019s capital adequacy was 21.3% at the end of 2024, well above the 8% minimum set by the central bank. Sector-wide liquidity remained high. Profitability increased, with the return on assets increasing to 2.8% in 2024 from 2.5% in 2023. The non-performing loan ratio decreased to 2.9% at the end of 2024 from 3.2% at the end of 2023. Bank lending to the non-financial sector amounted to around 36.5% of GDP in 2024. Bank financing remained the dominant form of lending, with non-banking financial institutions still underdeveloped. The Central Bank has intervened in the consumer and \u2018first residential property\u2019 loan market by issuing supervisory guidance for commercial banks to offer more favourable interest rates and lending conditions specifically for low-income employees and pensioners. While the objective is to improve the accessibility of banking services for all categories of the population, this measure risks distorting the credit market, creates incentives for loan uptake beyond market-driven conditions and raises loan default risks. A legal framework for microfinance institutions is yet to be drawn up. Backed by the capital market development strategy, Serbia is working to further develop the domestic corporate bond capital market. The availability of venture capital in Serbia is very limited, but the adoption of the Draft Law on Amendments and Supplements to the Law on Alternative Investment Funds in 2024 is a step in the right direction.\n\nFunctioning of the labour market\n\n![Image 37](blob:http://localhost/adeb27b8cbe16bc34141b38e8ae3e6e5)The labour market continued to improve. The overall unemployment rate fell to 8.6% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The activity rate of the population aged 15-64 continued to increase in 2024 and reached 72.7%. Net salaries increased by 13.9% in nominal terms, which due to lower inflation in 2024 translated into a 9.2% growth in real terms. Despite the increase in the activity rate of women, their participation in the labour force lags significantly behind that of men (66.9% and 78.6% respectively in 2024). The youth unemployment rate (15\u201124) was 23% in 2024, down from about 50% a decade ago. Emigration and the brain drain is a long-standing problem which has a negative impact on the growth and skills level of the labour force. Companies\u2019 access to skills is an increasing issue in various sectors. Despite notable unemployment, local labour shortage is a common issue for larger investments. Unemployment benefits and subsidised job seeker measures are low compared with the EU average. The budget allocated to active labour market measures has stagnated at around 0.1% of GDP in recent years. Undeclared work, especially in the agricultural sector, is a long-standing issue that has yet to be fully addressed. However, legislation on temporary agency employment and seasonal work has gradually lowered the rate of people working in the informal economy.\n\n2.3.2. The capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the EU\n\nEducation and innovation\n\nDespite the ongoing implementation of the 2030 education strategy, the quality of education and training has yet to meet labour market needs. Public spending on education remains below the EU average (3.2% in 2023[4](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025SC0755#footnote5)). According to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2022, Serbia\u2019s learning outcomes are below the OECD average, but at the top in the Western Balkans. Serbia made progress in facilitating the school-to-work transition, as evidenced by the 11 pps increase in employment rates of recent graduates over the past five years (reaching 73.1% in 2024) and the relatively low rate of young people not in education, employment or training (NEET) (15.2% in 2023 for people aged 15-29 and 15.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024). The modernisation of vocational education and training (VET) is ongoing. The quality of education needs to be improved to meet labour market needs and limited exposure to practical work-place training remains a challenge even for VET students. Participation rates in lifelong learning remained low. To remedy this, the offer could be diversified and better promoted, while reskilling and upskilling should be facilitated. The legal framework for lifelong learning lacks detailed implementation guidance, including standards for programme content, certification requirements and links to the National Qualifications Framework. Investment in research remained low at 0.88% of GDP in 2023 (against the EU average of 2.24%). The share of private-sector investment remained unchanged at 43.7% of total financing. The share of researchers in the labour force has steadily increased over the last 10 years to above the EU average. Implementation of Serbia\u2019s smart specialisation strategy, the strategy for development of start-up ecosystem and the law on innovation activity are ongoing.\n\nPhysical capital and quality of infrastructure\n\nThe level of government investment is high, concentrated in road and rail infrastructure, but infrastructure gaps remain. In 2024, Serbia invested a total of 23.6% of its GDP. The economy also attracted significant FDI inflows of EUR 4.6 billion, or 5.6% of GDP in 2024, largely directed to manufacturing, mining and construction. Government investment was relatively high at over 7.3% of GDP in 2024, concentrated in railways, roads, energy infrastructure and environmental investments. Continuous monitoring of transport investment compliance with European standards is a challenge. Energy infrastructure is largely outdated, and coal remains the main source of energy. However, recent auctions were successful in attracting bidders for new renewable sources. The regulatory and green transition reforms are progressing but at too slow a pace. Serbia remains highly dependent on Russia for gas and oil, although steps have been taken to diversify import sources. Work is progressing on transport connectivity with neighbouring countries. The authorities are committed to extending the \u2018green lanes\u2019 to neighbouring Member States, in line with the Growth Plan for the Western Balkans. Serbia\u2019s digital transformation is well under way. Digital connectivity infrastructure is well developed in urban areas but underdeveloped in rural areas where commercial operators do not see any economic interest. However, some progress on rural broadband connectivity has been made in recent years. Digital government services are well developed, already reaching the EU average in many dimensions. Businesses are relatively active in e-commerce, but digital uptake among SMEs remains constrained mainly due to insufficient support mechanisms to translate regulatory improvements into business practice.\n\n![Image 38](blob:http://localhost/5a5c2a58060344e08d138dc8810a2ba9)Sectoral and enterprise structure\n\n![Image 39](blob:http://localhost/b405aa5434255c5547c52d4f647be216)Services dominate the economy, providing more than two thirds of the value added. Industry continued to be the single largest sector in terms of its share of GDP, at 21.5% in 2024 although on a declining trend for several years. The share of the agricultural sector fell to 3.7% of GDP, while the share of the construction sector in GDP increased to 5.8% in 2024, supported by investments in infrastructure. SMEs provided close to 60% of total employment and turnover in the economy and around 50% of the value added in 2023[5](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025SC0755#footnote6). SMEs are particularly active in construction, housing and food services, retail and real estate. Serbia is implementing several programmes to support SME development, although the budget allocation remains modest and prone to ad hoc changes and cuts. Loans to SMEs consistently account for some two thirds of total corporate loans, but SMEs\u2019 borrowing costs are significantly higher than the costs faced by large companies. Policies to compensate for SMEs' lack of collateral, such as public credit guarantee schemes, are lacking. SMEs often face an uneven playing field as large companies and foreign investors often have direct lines of communication to the government and are much more likely to receive state subsidies.\n\nEconomic integration with the EU and price competitiveness\n\nEconomic integration with the EU is high. The EU is Serbia\u2019s biggest trading and investment partner, accounting for 58.3% of all trade and 37.6% of FDI inflows in 2024. Serbia\u2019s other main trading partners in 2024 were China (10%), the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) countries (9%) and T\u00fcrkiye (4.5%). China has become an increasingly important source of both imported goods and FDI inflows, accounting for around a third of the FDI inflow in 2024. There are still significant bottlenecks at border crossing points with neighbouring EU countries, despite continued efforts in various fora to address these.\n\nThe real effective exchange rate (REER) has steadily appreciated in recent years. The dinar\u2013euro nominal exchange rate was broadly stable, as the central bank successfully managed both appreciation (in 2024) and depreciation (in the first quarter of 2025) pressure on the dinar. The Consumer Price Index (CPI)\u2011based REER appreciated by 4.6% cumulatively between 2020 and 2022, edged down slightly by 0.3% in 2023, and then rose again by 0.4% in 2024. This reflects persistent inflation differentials between Serbia and its main trading partners. Similarly, the unit labour cost (ULC)-based REER continued to appreciate in 2024, rising by 13.4% over the year, mostly due to continued strong wage growth in the private sector.\n\n2.4. Public procurement, statistics and financial control\n\nChapter 5: Public procurement\n\nEU rules ensure that the public procurement of goods, services and works in any Member State is transparent and open to all EU companies on the basis of non-discrimination and equal treatment.\n\nInstitutional set-up and legal alignment\n\nThe legal framework of Serbia is broadly aligned with the EU acquis. The Law on public-private partnerships and concessions (PPPs) still needs to be amended to align with the Directive 2014/23/EU on concessions. In April 2025, Serbia adopted the 2025 annual action plan related to the 2024-2028 Programme for the development of the public procurement.\n\nSerbia continues to have the tendency to circumvent its legislation in this area through intergovernmental agreements and special laws, including for the implementation of the international specialised exhibition EXPO Belgrade 2027. The Law on special procedures for the implementation of EXPO Belgrade 2027 and its accompanying decree exempt projects from the application of the Law on public procurement (PPL) and continue to raise concerns with respect to their compliance with the EU acquis,including as regards legal redress and tender submission deadlines. Additionally, the Decree on the selection of a strategic partner for solar power plants which introduced an exemption from the PPL and the Law on PPPs remains in force. An EXPO 2027 module exists on the public procurement portal. The transparency of projects contracted under intergovernmental agreements has improved, but remains limited.\n\nImplementation and enforcement capacity\n\nIn 2024, the public procurement market represented 10.87% of GDP (10.50% in 2023) and increased by 22% in terms of total value of contracts while the average number of bids per tender slightly increased from 2.4 to 2.5. The share of tenders with only one submitted bid remained broadly at the same level (50.75%) as in 2023. The number of public procurement procedures applying green and social procurement principles doubled in 2024. The share of contracts awarded on the basis of the price and quality criterion doubled from 4.46% in 2023 to 9.78% in 2024. In 2024, 55 contracts for public-private partnerships were signed.\n\nConcerning the capacity to manage public procurement processes, the Public Procurement Office (PPO) remains slightly understaffed, whereas the administrative capacity of the Commission for Public-Private Partnerships and Concessions needs to be significantly strengthened. The PPO continued to provide trainings to contracting authorities, economic operators and the judiciary.\n\nThe total value of contracts exempted from the application of the PPL decreased from EUR 7.1 billion in 2023 to EUR 5.7 billion in 2024. Intergovernmental agreements were the second most frequently used legal basis for the exemptions in terms of value (EUR 1.2 billion) and represented 21% of the exemptions reported in 2024.\n\nThe number of public procurement procedures monitored by the PPO remained stable at 810 in 2024 (782 in 2023). The number of requests submitted by the PPO to the relevant courts to initiate misdemeanour proceedings remained stable (223 in 2024, 218 in 2023). The State Audit Institution found irregularities in cases covering 21.2% of the value of public procurement contracts audited in 2024. These findings raise concerns and need to be closely followed up. More efforts are needed to consistently apply the PPL, to improve competition and transparency and to avoid conflicts of interest in the public procurement process, which remains vulnerable to corruption.\n\nEfficient remedy system\n\n\nChapter 18: Statistics\n\nEuropean statistics are developed, produced and disseminated by EU Member States, guided by the principles and quality criteria elaborated in the Regulation on European statistics, such as professional independence, impartiality, reliability, accessibility transparency and statistical confidentiality. Common rules are in place for the methodology, production and dissemination of statistical information, which are further specified in sectoral legislation that constitute the EU acquis on statistics.\n\nSerbia\u2019s statistical infrastructure is largely in line with European standards and integrates the principles of the European Statistics Code of Practice. A new law on official statistics, which should enhance the professional independence of the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia (SORS) and improve the alignment with the amended Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 on European statistics has yet to be adopted. The institutional framework is functional, but the administrative capacity of SORS still needs to be strengthened.\n\nConcerning classifications and registers, the main classifications are aligned with the EU acquis and registers are updated regularly. SORS\u2019 submission of data to Eurostat continues to increase but the coverage of data needs to be further expanded.\n\nRegarding macroeconomic statistics, Serbia implemented a benchmark revision in 2024 and improved the completeness of the submitted ESA tables, but there are still data gaps. As regards government finance statistics (GFS) and excessive deficit procedure (EDP), efforts should continue to comply with ESA 2010. The coverage of the questionnaire related to the excessive deficit procedure notification tables as well as the alignment of ESA tables and EDP notifications following the benchmark revision should be further improved. The results pf the benchmark revision needs to be communicated adequately to users.\n\nSerbia is largely aligned with the EU acquis concernin g business statistics. It transmits structural business statistics (SBS) data and metadata for publication to Eurostat in good quality and in the required technical format. SORS also submits business demography (BD) data to Eurostat. However, for SBS as well as BD full coverage as well as timeliness has yet to be achieved. In the area of short-term business statistics (STS), Serbia produces fully compliant data except for service producer prices and the service production volume. Serbia should start the compilation of outward foreign affiliates statistics (outward FATS).\n\nSerbia broadly complies with the EU acquis on social statistics. However, further progress is needed to produce statistics on job vacancies. Demographic and international migration statistics are partly aligned with EU requirements. Serbia should increase efforts to provide population data by all required breakdowns and submit to Eurostat data on immigrants, emigrants and acquisition of citizenship by all requested breakdowns\n\nRegarding agricultural statistics, Serbia is largely compliant with the EU acquis but still needs to transmit agro-monetary statistics.\n\nAnnual and monthly energy statistics are produced and sent for all relevant energy sources. In the area of environmental statistics Serbia is fully compliant for physical environmental accounts. However, monetary environmental accounts data still need to be developed. Serbia has also yet to start submitting data on pesticide statistics, fertiliser consumption and gross nutrient balances, whereas and ecosystem accounts are still missing.\n\nChapter 32: Financial control\n\nThe EU promotes the reform of national governance systems to improve managerial accountability, sound financial management of income and expenditure and external audit of public funds. The financial control rules further protect the EU\u2019s financial interests against fraud in the management of EU funds and protect the euro against counterfeiting.\n\nPublic internal financial control\n\nThe legal, strategic and institutional framework for public internal financial control (PIFC) is broadly in place. However, Serbia should improve its implementation and ensure full consistency of the PIFC legal basis with the general legal framework. Weaknesses in performance management and lines of accountability between independent bodies and their parent institutions persist. The managerial accountability roadmap was adopted in December 2024, but its implementation is lagging behind.\n\nCapacities to implement internal control standards, including risk management, have to increase at both central and local government level and to be integrated in the administrative culture. The framework for irregularity reporting for budget beneficiaries is in place, but the system needs to be properly implemented. The Ministry of Finance has successfully centralised the budget inspection function which however needs to be strengthened. The mapping of the national inspection environment and ensuring its proper role and scope remain a priority.\n\nThe internal audit practice is broadly in line with international standards. However, despite an increase in the number of internal auditors, not all institutions required to put in place an internal audit unit have done so, and many internal audit units do not have a sufficient number of auditors. Amendments to the Budget System Law adopted in November 2024 introduced penal provisions for budget beneficiaries which fail to put in place internal audit functions but remain to be enforced.\n\nThe central harmonisation unit continued to focus on system development and dissemination of methodological guidance.\n\nExternal audit\n\nSerbia\u2019s constitutional and legal framework provides for the independence of the State Audit Institution (SAI) in line with the standards of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions. The SAI Strategic Plan for the period 2024-2028 is duly implemented. The SAI audit procedures are in line with international standards. Although short from filling all systematised job positions, SAI currently demonstrates sufficient institutional capacity. The implementation of its recommendations is satisfactory. However, the continued focus on the detection of errors and filing of misdemeanour and economic offences and criminal charges against individuals adversely affected SAI\u2019s capacity to carry out its core audit tasks. SAI\u2019s financial independence was respected during the 2025 budget approval procedure. The quality of audit work is constantly improving and during 2024, SAI started to conduct real-time performance audits.\n\nProtection of the EU\u2019s financial interests\n\nSerbia has achieved a high degree of EU acquis alignment, but full alignment with the Directive on the fight against fraud to the EU\u2019s financial interests by means of criminal law still needs to be ensured. The 2024-2026 strategic plan for combating fraud and managing irregularities in handling financial resources of the EU in Serbia is being implemented. The anti-fraud coordination service (AFCOS) in the Ministry of Finance has only five full time and three temporary employees out of the planned 13. In 2024, AFCOS performed five administrative checks.\n\nSerbia continued good cooperation with OLAF during investigations, and with other departments of the European Commission on the follow-up to recommendations. In 2024, Serbia reported 25 cases of irregularities via the Irregularity Management System. Serbia should maintain its efforts in further developing a solid track record on cooperation in investigations and reporting of irregularities.\n\nProtection of the euro against counterfeiting\n\nSerbia maintained a high degree of EU acquis alignment. The NBS has formal cooperation agreements with the European Commission on coins and with the European Central Bank on banknotes. NBS continued to develop its administrative capacities and actively cooperated with central banks in the region and Member States.\n\n3.Good neighbourly relations and regional cooperation\n\nGood neighbourly relations and regional cooperation form an essential part of Serbia\u2019s European integration process. They contribute to stability, reconciliation and a climate conducive to addressing open bilateral issues and the legacy of the past.\n\nSerbia maintained its engagement in several regional cooperation initiatives such as the Central European Free Trade Agreement, the Energy Community, the Transport Community, the South-East European Cooperation Process and the Regional Cooperation Council.\n\nThe fifth EU-Western Balkans Summit was held in December 2024 in Brussels. It provided an opportunity to build on the momentum in the strategic partnership between the European Union and the Western Balkans, including a reflection on how to deepen that partnership and move forward together towards a joint future in the EU.\n\nSerbia has actively engaged in the regional dimension of the Growth Plan for the Western Balkans, actively participating in both ministerial and leaders\u2019 meetings.\n\nOn the Common Regional Market (CRM), at the Berlin process summit in London in October 2025, the leaders of the region endorsed a revised and streamlined action plan to implement the Green Agenda for the Western Balkans, adopted a Western Balkans Climate Adaptation Roadmap and committed to make progress in the promotion of regional mobility and implementation of relevant regional agreements and CEFTA decisions. . Serbia signed the fifth mobility agreement on access to higher education and admission to studies in the Western Balkans and supported the CRM action plan for 2025-2028. So far, Serbia has ratified four of the five regional mobility agreements; the ratification of the fifth mobility agreement is still pending. The roadmap for roaming between the Western Balkans and the EU entered the first phase of implementation. Twelve decisions were agreed by the CEFTA Joint Committee in October 2024, following an agreement between CEFTA members that allowed decision making in the organisation to be unblocked.\n\nAs a signatory to the Dayton/Paris Peace Agreement, Serbia respects Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity while developing and publicly promoting special relations with the Republika Srpska entity. As part of a continuing trend, senior Serbian officials attended the unconstitutional entity celebrations on 9 January. Serbia hosted then political leaders of Republika Srpska entity despite recent arrests warrants issued against them by the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and filed a request at Interpol countering an international arrest warrant against the then Republika Srpska leader filed by a BiH court.\n\nSerbia continued to cooperate closely with Croatia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina under the Sarajevo Declaration Process to find sustainable solutions for refugees and persons displaced by conflicts in the 1990s.\n\nRegarding missing persons, Serbia continued working with the International Commission on Missing Persons and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Serbia took part in the work of the Western Balkans Missing Persons Group to address unresolved cases of mutual interest and unidentified persons together with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Croatia and Kosovo. Serbia also joined trilateral meetings to foster cooperation with Montenegro and Kosovo. No bilateral meeting with Croatia has taken place since January 2023. The Belgrade delegation to the ICRC-chaired working group on missing persons remained engaged, including in assessing possible grave sites in Serbia. The mechanism has not met at Heads of delegation level since April 2021, due to Kosovo\u2019s refusal to engage with the Head of the Belgrade delegation. Following ad hoc meetings of the working group at the level of Deputy Heads of delegation, hosted by the ICRC in January and July 2024, both delegations agreed on field work plans and to relaunch meetings at sub-levels of the working group to discuss specific cases (in July and October 2024). Another session of the Working Group was held in June 2025, with Kosovo delegation represented by its Head and Serbia by its Deputy Head. Consecutive sessions of the sub-working group scheduled for December 2024, January and June 2025 did not take place. Operational coordination was sustained through an ICRC-chaired thematic session on unidentified human remains (NNs) in March 2025, during which the parties exchanged information on several NNs cases of common interest and agreed to jointly focus on those.\n\nWhile these commitments have so far been only partially fulfilled by both delegations, several joint field assessments, excavations and examinations took place during the reporting period, resulting in the resolution of four missing persons\u2019 cases. Two joint field assessments were organised by the Belgrade delegation in 2024 (in Kozlje and Kozarevo, located in the Novi Pazar municipality) and the launch of forensic works in Kozlje started in September 2025. The parties have exchanged information that can potentially lead to the identification of five unidentified human remains in the Pristina mortuary. Recent analytical reports and extracts from internal archives obtained by the ICRC could potentially lead to further progress.\n\nOverall, Kosovo-Serbia cooperation in the working group remained hampered by unconstructive behaviour by the parties. On 17 December 2024, the two Chief Negotiators of Serbia and Kosovo agreed on the terms of reference for the Joint Commission on Missing Persons during an EU-facilitated Belgrade-Pristina Dialogue meeting, paving the way for the overdue implementation of the Joint Declaration on Missing Persons endorsed by President Vu\u010di\u0107 and Prime Minister Kurti in May 2023. The Joint Commission is yet to hold its first trilateral meeting.\n\nOverall, Serbia has remained committed to maintaining good bilateral relations with other candidate countries and neighbouring EU Member States. However, in 2025, several nationals of several EU Member States were expelled from Serbia and given a one-year entry ban on security grounds. Several EU Member States issued protest notes to the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in this regard.\n\nRelations with Albania remained good overall. However, Serbia reacted negatively to the signing of a declaration on cooperation in security and defence between Croatia, Albania and Kosovo.\n\nRelations with Bosnia and Herzegovina are overall good and stable. They continue to be affected by political tensions in relations to the 2024 \u2018all-Serb assembly\u2019 and its declaration on \u2018the common future of the Serbian people\u2019. As is the case every year, senior Serbian officials attended the unconstitutional Republika Srpska entity celebrations on 9 January. Milorad Dodik continued to receive political and logistical support from Serbia after the arrest warrant and final conviction, which the Serbian President and the Serbian government refuse to accept. As a signatory to the Dayton / Paris Peace Agreement, Serbia is obliged to respect Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The two countries need to reach an agreement on state borders, including on two dams on the Drina River and a part of the Belgrade-Bar railway.\n\nRelations with Montenegro are generally stable despite occasional mutual accusations. High-level visits took place and cooperation agreements were signed between the two countries. The Ambassador of Montenegro was accredited in April 2025.\n\nRelations with North Macedonia intensified. The Prime Minister of North Macedonia paid an official visit to Belgrade. Memoranda of Cooperation were signed on the energy sector, gas sector and public administration reform. Serbia opened an Honorary Consulate in Kumanovo.\n\nRelations with T\u00fcrkiye are good. The fourth meeting of the T\u00fcrkiye-Serbia High-level Cooperation Council took place in October 2024 in Belgrade, chaired by the two Presidents, who agreed to strengthen defence cooperation. Disagreement over T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s support to Kosovo\u2019s membership in international organisations (notably the Council of Europe) remains.\n\nRelations with Ukraine have improved, although Serbia has not joined the sanctions against the Russian Federation. The Serbian Embassy to Ukraine in Kyiv was reopened in December 2024 and the new Serbian Ambassador to Ukraine was accredited. In June 2025, President Vu\u010di\u0107 made his first official visit to Ukraine to participate in the Ukraine-Southeast Europe Summit in Odesa (re)confirming Serbia\u2019s support to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. However, he did not sign the common declaration (see also Chapter 31). Serbia continued to provide financial and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.\n\nRelations with the Republic of Moldova are good but trade relations are underdeveloped.\n\nSerbia\u2019s relations with Georgia are overall good. Serbia has a Memorandum of Understanding with Georgia on cooperation in the field of European integration. A parliamentary delegation from Georgia visited Belgrade in March 2025 and air flights have been launched from Belgrade to Tbilisi. Preparations are ongoing to open the Serbian Embassy in Tbilisi. Bilateral trade is underdeveloped.\n\nRelations with Romania and Bulgaria are overall good and relations with Hungary are very good, with high-level meetings taking place regularly and a number of joint strategic projects in the area of energy and transport.\n\nRelations with Croatia continue to be marked by ad hoc antagonistic public exchanges and diplomatic demarches. Serbia has expelled several Croatian nationals on alleged grounds of posing a security threat in the context of mass protests following the tragic accident at the railway station in Novi Sad. Nonetheless, energy cooperation between the two countries remained effective throughout the reporting period. Serbia reacted negatively to the declaration on cooperation in security and defence signed by Croatia, Albania and Kosovo and the signing of a bilateral agreement on expanding military cooperation between Croatia and Slovenia.\n\n4.normalisation of relations between Serbia and Kosovo\n\nThe EU-facilitated Dialogue on normalisation of relations between Serbia and Kosovo continued in the reporting period with regular Dialogue meetings on the level of Chief Negotiators.\n\nBoth Serbia and Kosovo are expected to implement all of their respective obligations stemming from the Agreement on the Path to Normalisation and its Implementation Annex, as well as all past Dialogue agreements, in line with the official recommitment made in September and October 2024 respectively. Serbia is expected to start delivering on its obligations from the Agreement by initiating the recognition of Kosovo\u2019s documents, symbols and institutions, while Kosovo is expected to start the process leading to the establishment of the Association/Community of Serb Majority Municipalities (A/CSM) in parallel. The Agreement is valid and legally binding for the parties and any formalities, including related to its adoption or \u201cformalisation\u201d, should not stand in the way of making progress in its implementation. The Parties also have an obligation to fully implement all past Dialogue Agreements. The constructiveness of the Parties will be assessed based solely on their own implementation performance. Normalisation of relations and implementing their Dialogue commitments remain essential conditions on the European path of both Parties and both risk losing important opportunities in the absence of progress.\n\nIn January 2025, the Council appointed Peter S\u00f8rensen as EU Special Representative for the Belgrade-Pristina Dialogue, to assist High-Representative/Vice-President in taking forward the normalisation talks.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the situation in the north of Kosovo remained calm but fragile. In November 2024, an attack on the Iber Lepenc / Ibar Lepenac canal in the north of Kosovo took place for which perpetrators still have to be apprehended and brought to justice. In summer 2025, a series of arrests by both Serbia and Kosovo, including the Assistant Director of the Serbian Office for Kosovo Igor Popovi\u0107 (later released), temporarily negatively affected the normalisation process. In this context, Serbia is expected to comply with the 2015 Justice Agreement stipulating that criminal proceedings for offences in Kosovo are to take place in principle in front of Kosovo courts, notably in the case of arrest of Arbnor Spahiu. Serbia repeatedly conducted activities contrary to its obligations under the Agreement on the Path to Normalisation by lobbying against Kosovo\u2019s membership in international organisations. The normalisation process continues to be impacted by insufficient steps by Serbia to ensure accountability for the violent attack by armed Kosovo Serb assailants against Kosovo Police on 24 September 2023 in Banjska/Banjsk\u00eb, which constituted the gravest escalation in recent years. Kosovo also repeatedly conducted activities contrary to its obligations under the Dialogue, including police operations against Serbia-supported structures and services in the north. Kosovo also arrested and immediately deported Kosovo citizens working for Serbian security structures and constructed two new bridges in Mitrovica in the vicinity of the main bridge. These actions are not in line with the spirit of normalisation. The EU expressed concerns about the recurrent lack of coordination by Kosovo and the negative impact on local communities and their access to basic public and social services, while reiterating that the actions undermine efforts towards sustained de-escalation \u2013 most recently in its statement of 16 May 2025.\n\nWhen it comes to the state of play on implementation of all Dialogue agreements:\n\n-The withdrawal of Kosovo Serbs from Kosovo institutions in November 2022 and the boycott of local elections in the north of Kosovo in April 2023 violate Serbia\u2019s Dialogue obligations and they constitute severe backsliding in Serbia\u2019s compliance with the April 2013 \u201cFirst agreement of principles governing the normalisation of relations\u201d and direct violation of the Justice Agreement of 2015. At the time of reporting, both Parties are not complying with the 2013 \u201cFirst agreement of principles governing the normalisation of relations and the 2015 Justice Agreement. The EU welcomed the participation of Kosovo Serbs in the parliamentary elections on 9 February 2025 and local elections in Kosovo on 12 October 2025 as a first step towards return of Kosovo Serbs to Kosovo institutions. The EU recalls that the return of Kosovo Serb officials to Kosovo institutions, including judiciary and law enforcement, has to be done in accordance with past Dialogue agreements and with full respect for Kosovo\u2019s legal framework.\n\n-There has been no further progress on the implementation of the August 2015 Agreement, which laid down the principles for establishing the A/CSM. Kosovo and Serbia are urged to engage constructively on the establishment of the A/CSM based on the European Draft Statute presented to the Parties in October 2023 with no further delay. This obligation forms a part of the implementation of the Agreement on the Path to Normalisation of Relations, which the Parties are expected to advance on, as recalled by the European Council in October 2023. The status of Serbia-supported structures and services in Kosovo needs to be addressed in line with agreements reached in the EU-facilitated Dialogue and Kosovo law and not through uncoordinated measures.\n\n-The works on the Austerlitz bridge in Mitrovica, as well as additional assessments and consultations have been completed. The position of the EU remains that the bridge should be opened. The opening has to be coordinated with security partners.\n\n-The implementation of the 2013 and 2015 Energy agreements and 2022 Energy Roadmap continued. Serbia is encouraged to allocate cross-border capacities to Kosovo and fulfil its longstanding obligation under the Energy Community Treaty.\n\n-As regards the technical Dialogue agreements (2011-2012), some are not or only partially implemented. Until sustainable solutions are found, both Parties need to remain committed to the continued implementation of the Arrangements on Regional Representation and Cooperation, which enables Kosovo\u2019s participation in regional forums. Neither Party should block the work of regional forums over bilateral disputes. The implementation of the Agreements on cadastre and acceptance of university diplomas agreements is still pending due to non-implementation by Serbia. Serbia also has yet to address the issue of re-located Serbian administrative customs structures with Kosovo denomination that operate from within Serbia.\n\n-On IBM, the Interim Common Crossing-Points (CCPs) between Serbia and Kosovo continue to be operational. Only two of the six permanent CCPs have been established (Merdare and Mutivod\u00eb/Mutivode). Serbia still has not established permanent CCPs to be hosted by their side (Jarinje/Rudnica, Kon\u010dulj/Dheu i Bardh\u00eb and Depce/Mu\u00e7ibab\u00eb), which led to a suspension of EU funds for this project in July 2018. In addition, Serbia needs to engage constructively to enable the construction of the third CCP hosted by Kosovo in the north of Kosovo at Tabavije/B\u00ebrnjak-Tabalije/Brnjak. Additional efforts are required from Serbia to close illegal roads and bypasses to ensure exclusive use of official crossing points for goods and persons entering into or leaving Kosovo. While a first discussion on harmonisation of phytosanitary and veterinary certificates took place at technical level on 23 April 2025, Serbia should allow the resumption of the EU-facilitated joint IBM meetings at all levels (local, regional and central).\n\n-On freedom of movement, the EU welcomes the phasing out of plates with Kosovo cities\u2019 denomination issued by Serbia and the mutual recognition of licence plates, which took place in December 2023 and January 2024. The full implementation of the Freedom of Movement agreements still requires additional steps. In this context, Kosovo is encouraged to offer an effective registration process to all citizens for obtaining personal documents and Kosovo licence plates.\n\n-Both Parties need to fully respect the Telecoms Agreement and not put its hitherto successful implementation at risk in any way. The Parties are also expected to engage constructively and find through the Dialogue sustainable solutions to the remaining issues such as frequency harmonisation and postal services.\n\n-The processing of mutual legal assistance (MLA) requests has been stopped by Serbia. Serbia needs to resume the MLA processing immediately in line with established and previously respected practice and address also pending requests. Judicial cooperation in criminal matters and civil cases is covered by MLA and not police cooperation.\n\n-Both Parties need to respect the Arrangements for Official Visits in good faith and without preconditions. Almost no visits took place during the reporting period. Both Serbia and Kosovo need to allow the visits of their respective Chief Negotiator, other government officials and religious authorities when they are announced and conducted in line with the Arrangements, which has not always been the case. Official visitors are expected to refrain from divisive statements or behaviour.\n\n-Limited progress has been made in the implementation of the political Declaration on Missing Persons adopted in May 2023 with the 17 December 2024 agreement on the Terms of Reference for the Joint Commission to be established as per the Declaration. The Parties are encouraged to refrain from politisation of this humanitarian issue and start implementing the Declaration immediately by holding a first meeting of the Joint Commission.\n\nOverall, Serbia and Kosovo have participated in the Dialogue, but they need to demonstrate more serious and constructive commitment to advance the normalisation process. Moving forward, Serbia and Kosovo also need to make further substantial efforts to avoid actions that undermine stability and rhetoric that is not conducive to dialogue and reconciliation.\n\n5. Ability to assume the obligations of membership\n\nCluster 2: Internal market\n\nThis cluster covers: free movement of goods (Chapter 1); freedom of movement for workers (Chapter 2); right of establishment and freedom to provide services (Chapter 3); free movement of capital (Chapter 4); company law (Chapter 6); intellectual property law (Chapter 7); competition policy (Chapter 8); financial services (Chapter 9) and consumer and health protection (Chapter 28).\n\nChapter 1: Free movement of goods\n\nThe free movement of goods ensures that many products can be traded freely across the EU based on common rules and procedures. Where products are governed by national rules, the principle of the free movement of goods prevents these rules from creating unjustified barriers to trade.\n\nGeneral principles\n\nSerbia revised the strategic documents to implement EU acquis in accordance with Commission\u2019s assessment. Serbia now needs to adopt the revised strategic documents and ensure their timely implementation. Assessment of the legislation regarding Serbia\u2019s application for an Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance covering low voltage devices, electromagnetic compatibility, machinery, and personal protective equipment is ongoing.\n\nNon-harmonised area\n\nSerbia needs to timely implement its action plan to ensure compliance with Articles 34-36 of the TFEU. Serbia remains partly aligned with the EU acquis on mutual recognition.\n\nHarmonised area: quality infrastructure\n\nSerbia has a developed quality infrastructure system, overseen by the Ministry of Economy and supported by various key entities and market surveillance bodies. However, the quality infrastructure institutions need additional budget and human resources. On standardisation, the national legislation is highly aligned with the relevant EU acquis and Serbia has aligned with 99,5%of European standards (EN).\n\nConformity assessment bodies in Serbia increased to 918 from 889 in 2024. Serbia accepts the CE marking as a conformity mark and repealed most of the required obligations regarding Serbian certificates of conformity for EU products. However, Serbian certificates of conformity are still required for drones, and construction products including cement, steel for the reinforcement of concrete, and specific types of screws. Serbian legislation remains partly aligned with the EU acquis on accreditation and metrology. Serbia needs to align with the latest EU acquis on market surveillance, adopt an adequate market surveillance strategy and increase the number of market surveillance staff and IT resources.\n\nHarmonised area: sectoral legislation\n\nSerbia needs to fully align its national legislation with the latest EU acquis on machinery.\n\nThere was no progress on alignment with EU \u2018new and global approach\u2019 or EU \u2018old approach\u2019 product acquis. Serbia needs to align with the EU acquis on radio equipment. The alignment and capacity to implement the EU acquis on vehicle homologation needs to be strengthened.\n\nOn procedural measures, in August 2025 Serbia adopted and published a national control list of weapons partly aligned with the EU.\n\nChapter 2 - Freedom of movement for workers\n\nCitizens of one Member State have the right to work in another Member State and must be given the same working and social conditions as other workers.\n\nRegarding access to the labour market, the legislative framework is partially aligned with the EU acquis as EU citizens are currently covered by rules for third-country nationals. In 2024, a total of 17 251 work permits were issued, of which 3% (526) to EU citizens. The working permit procedure has been simplified by the new system of single permit for residence and work.\n\nSerbia\u2019s National Employment Service has continued to carry out preparations for joining EURES (European employment services) upon accession and has started work to align its national classification of occupations to the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO). Serbia needs to initiate preparations for joining the European Labour Authority.\n\nRegarding the coordination of social security systems, bilateral agreements are in place with 20 EU Member States. No new bilateral agreements were concluded over the reporting period. Overall, legislative and technical conditions for social security institutions to cooperate with their counterparts in EU Member States need to be further improved.\n\nThere were no developments on the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). Serbia currently applies agreements on the use of EHIC with nine EU Member States.\n\nChapter 3: Right of establishment and freedom to provide services\n\nEU natural and legal persons have the right to establish themselves in any Member State and to provide cross-border services. For certain regulated professions, there are rules on mutual recognition of qualifications. EU rules on postal services focus on improving the quality of universal service, gradual market opening to competition, and the establishment of an independent regulator.\n\nIn the areas of the right of establishment and freedom to provide cross-border services, the legal framework remains to be aligned with the EU acquis.Some progress was made with the adoption of the horizontal Law on services in November 2024 which is partially aligned with the EU Services Directive. The Law provides for the establishment of a point of single contact by the end of 2026. Sectoral legislation remains to be aligned with the EU Services Directive. The institutional framework needs to be further strengthened.\n\nIn the area of postal services, the legal framework is aligned with the First and Second Postal Services Directives as well as partly with the Third Postal Services Directive. With the new Law on postal services entering into force in March 2025, Serbia aligned its legislation with the Regulation on cross-border parcel delivery services. The new postal law also lowered the weight limit for reserved letter items from 50 grams to 20 grams in line with the Postal Services Directive foreseeing a progressive and controlled opening of the postal market to competition. The national regulatory authority remains sufficiently staffed to manage ongoing responsibilities related to the postal market. Serbia continued to implement its Postal Services Development Strategy 2021-2025 to enable postal services to adapt to the technological, digitalisation, and e-commerce developments. Work is ongoing to prepare a new strategy for postal services 2026-2030.\n\nIn the field of mutual recognition of professional qualifications, national legislation is broadly aligned with the EU acquis. Serbia needs to fully align with the Professional Qualifications Directive, and the Proportionality Test Directive as well as further harmonise relevant sectoral legislation. On the mutual recognition of professional qualifications for nurses, veterinary surgeons, pharmacists and midwives, Serbia ratified the CEFTA agreement in September 2024. Certain regulated professions still have nationality requirement for access. A preliminary list of 50 regulated professions is pending adoption but does not contain all seven sectoral professions which benefit from automatic recognition under the Directive.\n\nChapter 4: Free movement of capital\n\nIn the EU, capital and investments must be able to move without restrictions, with common rules for cross-border payments. Banks and other economic operators apply certain rules to support the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nIn the field of capital movements and payments, the institutional framework is in place. The legal framework is partially aligned with the EU acquis. Certain restrictions on capital movements remain on short-term foreign credit and deposit operations, on transactions with financial derivatives, on the Insurance Law and the Law on Voluntary Pension Funds. Administrative burden for entities engaging in foreign exchange operations remain significant.EU citizens still do not have equal treatment regarding the acquisition of real estate and agricultural land, which is not compliant with Serbia\u2019s obligations under the SAA.\n\nOn payment services, the legal framework was further aligned with the EU acquis. Amendments to the Law on payment services aligning with the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) started applying as of May 2025 and the related implementing legislation was adopted in December 2024. Having undertaken the necessary alignment with the acquis, Serbia joined the geographic scope of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) payment schemes in May 2025. Nevertheless, Serbia should continue its efforts to align with the EU acquis in the area of payment services, including with the Cross-Border Payments Regulation. The Law on multilateral interchange fees and special operating rules for card-based payment transactions remains to be aligned with the EU acquis and the SAA obligations (See Chapter 8 \u2013 Competition policy).\n\nOn the fight against money laundering and terrorism financing (AML/CFT), the legal framework is in place and to a large extent aligned with the current EU acquis. In the reporting period, Serbia further aligned the AML/CFT Law and the Law on central records of beneficial owners with the fifth EU anti-money laundering Directive and Regulation 2023/1113 on transfer of funds.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the updated national risk assessment for AML/CFT in December 2024, the Strategic Operational Plan for the 2025-2029 period was adopted in April 2025. In May 2025, MONEYVAL conducted an evaluation visit for the sixth round of mutual evaluation in Serbia.\n\nThe institutional framework is in place but need to be further strengthened, including through increased capacity in the Administration for Prevention of Money Laundering (APML). In 2024, 2 014 suspicious transactions were reported to the APML, including 1 161 from the banks and by September 2025, 1 474 suspicious transactions had been reported, including 944 from banks.\n\nChapter 6: Company law\n\nThe EU has common rules on the formation, registration and disclosure requirements of a company, with complementary rules for accounting and financial reporting, and statutory audit.\n\nAs regards company law and corporate governance, Serbia\u2019s legislation has a good level of alignment with the EU acquis. The adoption of a new Law on takeovers of joint-stock companies and related legislation to a lign with the EU acquis on company takeover bids is pending. Further alignment is needed with the directives on the use of digital tools and on cross-border conversions, mergers and divisions. Serbia\u2019s Corporate Governance Code is based on EU best practice and OECD principles. Company information in the business register is stored electronically in a database and is technically ready to interconnect with the Business Registers Interconnection System upon EU accession.\n\nRegarding company reporting, Serbia has yet to align with the EU acquis on corporate sustainability reporting, on the disclosure of income tax information by certain undertakings and branches, and regarding the adjustments of the size criteria for micro, small, medium-sized and large undertakings or groups, bearing in mind the ongoing developments with the EU acquis. The Law on capital market is largely aligned with the EU Transparency Directive for listed companies.\n\nChapter 7: Intellectual property law\n\nThe EU has to a large extent harmonised rules for the legal protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR), covering notably patents, biotechnological inventions and pharmaceuticals, including supplementary protection certificates (SPCs), trademarks, designs, geographical indications (GIs), including craft and industrial GIs, as well as copyright and related rights.\n\nThe Law on copyright and related rights remains to be further aligned with the EU acqui s, in particular with Directives 2014/26 on collective rights management, 2012/28 on orphan works and 2017/1564 on certain permitted uses of certain works and other subject matter protected by copyright and related rights for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print-disabled. Work on the alignment of Serbia\u2019s legal framework with Directive 2019/789 on the exercise of copyright and related rights applicable to certain online transmissions of broadcasting organisations and retransmissions of television and radio programmes, and Directive 2019/790 on copyrights and related rights in the Digital Single Market is ongoing.\n\nOn industrial property rights, the legislative framework is generally in line with the relevant EU acquis. The Intellectual Property Office is relatively well staffed and efficient in registering trademarks. In 2024, it received 2 600 applications for trademark protection and 273 for industrial designs. It registered 1 935 trademarks and 273 industrial designs during the same period. In 2024, there were 1 304 validated European patents while 21 national patents were granted.\n\nOn enforcement, the amount of counterfeit and pirated goods confiscated and destroyed by the Market Inspectorate increased significantly from 739 750 in 2023 to 1 215 425 in 2024, while the number of items detained by the Customs Administration dropped from 290 866 in 2023 to 103 894 in 2024. A new programme on the development of intellectual property remains to be adopted. Work to further align with the Directive on the enforcement of IPR is ongoing. The Intellectual Property Office set up an enforcement unit in charge of coordinating the work of the IPR enforcement coordination body. However, the electronic platform for information exchange among IPR enforcement institutions remains to be launched. Due to inadequate specialisation and the increasing number of new cases, the capacity of the judiciary to handle IPR cases remains limited\n\nChapter 8 - Competition policy\n\nEU rules protect free competition. They include antitrust rules against restrictive agreements between companies and abuse of a dominant position, and rules on concentrations between companies which would significantly impede effective competition. EU rules also set out a system of State aid control. Governments are only allowed to grant State aid if restrictive conditions are met, with a view to preventing distortion of competition.\n\nAntitrust and mergers\n\nThe legislative framework is broadly in line with Articles 101 and 102 TFEU and related provisions of the SAA but needs to be fully aligned with EU guidelines and communications. Three block exemption regulations remain to be adopted. No progress was made on aligning Article 9 of the Law on multilateral interchange fees and special operating rules for card-based payment transactions with the EU acquis and the SAA.\n\nRegarding the institutional framework, the Commission for Protection of Competition (CPC) has a reputation as an operationally independent institution. The level of fines in 2024 decreased from over EUR 3 million in 2023 to around EUR 0.5 million. Work should continue on sustaining a credible enforcement record, decisions should be systematically published, and the transparency of the CPC\u2019s work should increase.\n\nThe enforcement capacity of the CPC is relatively adequate. Consulting the CPC on all relevant legislation should continue and its opinions should be systematically taken into account. The CPC should further step up advocacy activities. The capacity and specialisation of the judiciary for complex competition cases needs to be improved significantly.\n\nState aid\n\nRegarding the legislative framework on State aid, the Law on State aid control is broadly in line with the EU acquis and the relevant provisions of the SAA. To further align implementing legislation with the EU acquis, three new decrees were adopted in February 2025. However, additional implementing legislation needs to be further aligned. Existing State aid schemes, most notably the fiscal State aid schemes established by the laws on corporate income tax, on personal income tax and on free zones, are not yet aligned with the EU acquis. In line with its SAA obligations, Serbia has finalised an inventory of State aid schemes. However, a timebound action plan for alignment of incompatible schemes remains to be adopted by the government. Furthermore, the regional aid map still has to be drafted.\n\nOn the institutional framework, the operational independence of the Commission for State Aid Control (CSAC) needs to be demonstrated by establishing a transparent track record that shows consistent and satisfactory implementation of the law.\n\nCSAC\u2019s enforcement capacity in terms of staffing should be further strengthened.\n\nThe implementation of the Law on State aid control should be further improved. In particular, the notification and the standstill obligations need to be respected systematically. State aid is occasionally provided to economic operators, particularly foreign investors, without prior approval by CSAC. It is important that Serbia ensures that all State aid grantors, including municipalities, notify State aid ex ante. CSAC\u2019s annual reports on State aid granted should be adopted timely by the government. Advocacy activities among aid-granting authorities need to continue as there is a systematic lack of awareness of State aid rules.\n\nOn liberalisation, a new decree on de minimis aid for the provision of services of general economic interest was adopted in February 2025, while rules on public service compensation to undertakings for the provision of services of general economic interest need to be further aligned. Enforcement of competition rules for public companies needs to be intensified. There is no evidence of the existence of commercial monopolies within the meaning of Article 37 TFEU.\n\nChapter 9 - Financial services\n\nEU rules aim at ensuring fair competition among financial institutions and the stability and integrity of financial markets, namely in the field of banking, insurance, supplementary pensions, investment services and securities. They include rules on authorisation, operation and supervision of these institutions.\n\nIn the area of banking and financial conglomerates, the institutional and legal framework is in place, with a good level of alignment with the previous versions of the Capital Requirements Regulation and the Capital Requirements Directive (CRR/CRD). Amendments to the Law on banks were adopted in March 2025 and will apply as of October 2025, aiming to further align with CRR II and CRD V. Work needs to continue to align with the latest versions of the CRR/CRD. Regarding bank resolution, the amended Law on banks created a dedicated resolution fund to be financed with contributions from banks, as well as important elements of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive II (BRRD II), such as: rules on the calculation of the minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) as percentage of total risk exposure amount and total exposure measure; the concepts of resolution entity and resolution group; option to impose a pre-resolution moratorium in addition to the possibility of already existing post-resolution moratorium. However, full alignment with the revised version of the BRRD is yet to be achieved. NBS also progressed on the operationalisation of the resolution framework by adopting several implementing legislation to the Law on banks. As regards protection of deposits, Serbia needs to further align its national legislation with the EU Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive.\n\nRegarding insurance and occupational pensions, a new Law on compulsory traffic insurance is yet to be prepared. Preparations for alignment with the Solvency II Directive are ongoing. Alignment is still to be completed as regards the Directive on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision.\n\nIn the area of financial market infrastructure, Serbia remains partially aligned with the EU acquis and should continue alignment efforts. Serbia is implementing its Capital market development strategy for 2021-2026, focusing on completing the implementing legislation of the Law on capital market.\n\nOn securities markets and investment services, Serbia should further align with the EU acquis. Despite amendments to the Law on open-ended investment funds and the Law on alternative investment funds adopted in December 2024, further work is needed to fully align with the Directive on alternative investment fund managers (AIFMD) and the Directive relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS).\n\nThere were no developments on sustainable and digital finance in the reporting period.\n\nChapter 28 - Consumer and health protection\n\nEU rules protect consumers\u2019 economic interests and in relation to product safety, dangerous imitations and liability for defective products. The EU also ensures high common standards for tobacco control, blood, tissues, cells and organs, as well as human and veterinary medicinal products. The EU also has rules for upholding patients\u2019 rights in cross-border healthcare and in preparing for and responding to serious cross-border health threats including communicable diseases.\n\nConsumer protection\n\nOn horizontal aspects, Serbia\u2019s legislation remains largely aligned with the EU consumer protection framework, however the horizontal Law on consumer protection requires further alignment.\n\nOn non-safety issues,the number of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) bodies increased to 71, and the number of solved cases in ADRs proceedings amounted to 3993 in 2024 and 1869 in 2025. The financial stability of ADRs needs to be ensured.In its capacity as an ADR body in charge of financial institutions, in 2025 the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) resolved 813 complaints related to banks. Serbia adopted the new Law on the protection of financial service consumers which aims for further alignment.\n\nOn product safety, Serbia\u2019s legislation needs to be further aligned with the EU acquis, and market surveillance capacities need to be strengthened (see also Chapter 1).\n\nPublic health\n\nOn public health, Serbia needs to ensure the sustainability of the public health insurance fund, full compliance with EU health indicators, implement the national plan for human resources in the health sector, and adopt secondary legislation to improve the organisation of emergency services. On eHealth, the Law on health records and documentation needs to be aligned with the EU data protection acquis, standards and principles.\n\nThere was no progress on alignment with the EU acquis on tobacco control. Serbia needs to intensify controls to ensure effective implementation of tobacco control measures. Surveillance and response capacities for serious cross-border health threats, including communicable diseases, remain limited and in need of modernisation. Serbia needs to increase awareness of the necessity of childhood vaccination. There was no progress on alignment with the EU acquis on blood, tissues, cells and organs, patients\u2019 rights in cross-border healthcare, on human and veterinary medicinal products, on medical devices, or on health technology assessment. Serbia needs to implement stricter controls on prescriptions of antimicrobials for human and veterinary use to bolster its efforts on antimicrobial resistance.\n\nCommunity-based mental health services remain underdeveloped, with low accessibility, and the 2019-2026 mental health protection programme remains to be implemented. There were no new developments on cancer, on nutrition and physical activity, on drug abuse prevention and harm reduction, or on health inequalities. Appropriate funding is needed to ensure implementation of the national programme on sexual and reproductive health. There is a need for humane and adequate treatment in gynaecological and obstetric facilities.\n\nOn anti-corruption, the Law on medicinal products and medical devices and its by-laws contain anti-corruption provisions, though aspects on the promotion or advertising of medicinal products need to be improved.\n\nCluster 3: Competitiveness and inclusive growth\n\nThis cluster covers: digital transformation and media (Chapter 10); taxation (Chapter 16); economic and monetary policy (Chapter 17); social policy and employment (Chapter 19); industrial policy (Chapter 20); science and research (Chapter 25); education and culture (Chapter 26); and customs union (Chapter 29).\n\nChapter 10: Digital transformation and media\n\nThe EU supports the proper functioning of the internal market for electronic communications, electronic commerce and audiovisual services. The rules protect consumers and support the universal availability of modern services.\n\nOn overall strategy, Serbia\u2019s digital transformation is guided by EU alignment and public investment with a focus on innovation. Serbia joined the European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIH) network on 1 January 2025, and participates in the Digital Europe Programme, EU Digital Agenda for the Western Balkans, EU4Digital initiative and Wifi4WB.\n\nRegarding electronic communications, the Law on electronic communication is partially aligned with the European Electronic Communications Code. Full adoption of secondary legislation is still needed. The full operational and financial independence of the Regulatory Agency for Electronic Communications and Postal Services (RATEL) also remains to be ensured, and its administrative capacity needs to be improved.\n\nThe 112 European emergency number calling system has not yet been fully implemented according to EU standards.\n\nThe Law on broadband infrastructure, which aims to align with the Gigabit Infrastructure Act, remains to be adopted.\n\nSerbia initiated the 5G frequency auction, having previously adopted the implementing legislation on minimum conditions for issuing individual operator licences for spectrum use for the 5G frequency auction. Serbia transposed the EU 5G Cybersecurity Toolbox, which it needs to fully implement, including the assessment of suppliers\u2019 risk profiles and putting in place appropriate restrictions and/or exclusions for high-risk suppliers. Regarding regional integration, Serbia has not yet signed the Memorandum of Understanding on a 5G roadmap for digital transformation.There were no developments regarding competitive safeguards, while the cable operators\u2019 market landscape further concentrated, and media content market share changed.\n\nRegarding digital services, Serbia continued upgrading the government service information portal and introduced new e-gov services. Serbia needs to align with the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act. Serbia also needs to fully align with the EU\u2019s Open Data Directive on the reuse of public sector information.\n\nRegarding digital trust and cybersecurity, further alignment with the EU acquis on the European Digital Identity Framework Regulation is needed in preparation for the roll-out of an interoperable national digital wallet. Serbia needs to align with the Network and Information Security 2 (NIS2) Directive.\n\nOn media, Parliament failed to timely launch the process to elect a new REM Council by 4 November 2024 as provided for by the law. As a consequence, the REM Council mandate expired and caused a regulatory vacuum. The process was launched on 25 November 2024 but not completed following a number of reported irregularities. A new call for REM Council was launched in May 2025 \u2013 months after the legal deadline. Several candidates and proposers also initially withdrew at the start of the second call. However, with international facilitation, the process resumed and advanced with the shortlisting of candidates.\n\nIn June 2025, Serbia adopted amendments to the Law on electronic media, the Law on public information and media, and the Law on public broadcasters. Several media associations were critical of the process as it was not sufficiently inclusive nor transparent. Alignment with the European Media Freedom Act is needed. Serbia also needs to amend the Law on advertising to ensure alignment with the Audiovisual Media Services Directive. The competition for the allocation of the fifth frequency for national broadcasting, launched in 2022 remains incomplete without a justified reason.\n\nOn semiconductors, Serbia does not yet align with the EU Chips Act. Regarding artificial intelligence, Serbia needs to align with the EU AI Act and create the necessary governance structures. In 2025, Serbia became co-chair of the OECD-backed Global Partnership on AI (GPAI). Serbia adopted a strategy for the development of artificial intelligence for 2025-2030.\n\nChapter 16 - Taxation\n\nEU rules on taxation cover value-added tax, excise duties and aspects of corporate taxation. They also cover cooperation between tax administrations, including the exchange of information to prevent tax evasion.\n\nIn the area of taxation, the institutional framework is in place.\n\nRegarding indirect taxation, the legislative framework is partially aligned with the EU acquis. The Law on Value Added Tax was amended to introduce preliminary tax returns for VAT, modernising the system. Despite gradual increases, the Law on excise duties has yet to be fully aligned with the EU acquis. While the 2024 amendment aligned the excise duties on tobacco with the EU minima, the application of excise duty on natural gas was further postponed until 1 January 2026 for its use as propellant and until accession for heating purposes. An effective system to control and monitor the movement of excisable products is not yet fully in place, although improvements were made to the e-excise system for cigarettes and non-burning tobacco.\n\nRegarding direct taxation, the legislative framework is partially aligned with the EU acquis. 2024 amendments to the Law on tax procedures and tax administration created a legal basis for the establishment of a comprehensive tax registry of natural persons, which will improve enforcement efforts.\n\nSerbia cooperates with the EU through an enhanced dialogue on tax good governance, on the basis of the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes. The country remains committed to implement the Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting minimum standards.\n\nRegarding administrative cooperation and mutual assistance, the institutional and legislative framework is largely in place and aligned. Serbia signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the exchange of country-by-country reports in March 2025 but is yet to implement automatic exchange of financial account information.\n\nRegarding operational capacity and computerisation,the institutional framework needs to be strengthened. The capacities of the Tax Administration, particularly on enforcement, need improving. The procurement of the IT system was delayed, while efforts to meet the requirement for the exchange of information on VAT (VIES system) are underway.\n\nChapter 17 - Economic and monetary policy\n\nEU rules require the independence of central banks and prohibit them from directly financing the public sector. Member States coordinate their economic policies and are subject to fiscal, economic and financial surveillance.\n\nOn monetary policy, the institutional framework is in place and the legal framework is largely aligned with the EU acquis. In March 2025, Serbia further aligned the Law on the NBS with the EU acquis. However, to ensure the full functional, institutional, personal, and financial independence of the NBS additional amendments are still needed, including amendments to the Law on public property. Regarding economic policy, the legal framework is partially aligned with the EU acquis. The 2025 budget listed for the first time a number of capital investment projects planned over a three-year horizon and applied a green tagging methodology. However, the introduction of a presentation of tax expenditures has been further postponed. Further alignment with the Directive on requirements for budgetary frameworks is needed through amendments to the Law on the budget system regarding macroeconomic and fiscal projections, a 3-year expenditure perspective, transparency, and accounting and statistical reporting. Furthermore, the sizeable contingency reserve, which has in recent years been used to facilitate ad hoc spending measures, lacks clearly defined restrictions for its usage and would benefit from improved regular reporting.\n\nThe budget procedure, including for amending budgets, needs to be systematically respected and public participation in the budget process and budget oversight by the legislature needs to be improved. In recent years, in-year ad hoc spending measures have been a recurrent feature of budget execution which should be avoided. The institutional framework is well-developed, but programme budgeting needs to be strengthened, and administrative and IT capacity bolstered.\n\nThe government submitted its 2025-2027 Economic Reform Programme (ERP) on 15 January 2025. As in previous years, its analytical diagnostics were solid. Core reforms under the ERP continue from the previous programme and are in line with the Reform Agenda. Implementation of policy guidance set out in the conclusions of the Economic and Financial Dialogue of May 2024 has been partial.\n\nChapter 19 - Social policy and employment\n\nEU rules in the social field include minimum requirements for labour law, equality and non-discrimination, health and safety at work. They also promote social inclusion and social protection, and social dialogue at EU level.\n\nIn the field of labour law, the 2014 law remains only partially aligned with the EU acquis. The number of labour inspectors continues to be below the target of the Chapter 19 action plan. The number of child labour cases identified in 2024 by the Labour Inspectorate (0 cases) and the Republic Institute for Social Welfare (23 cases) is under-reported, compared with the National Child Labour Survey. Serbia has not yet addressed the recommendations of the Council of Europe Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (GRETA) which called for proactive and thorough investigation of allegations of trafficking for labour exploitation involving foreign workers. The law on inspection oversight still does not comply with the International Labour Organisation (ILO)\u2019s Convention requiring that labour inspectors be empowered to enter workplaces freely and without giving notice.\n\nIn the area of health and safety at work, the legislation of 2023 remains partially aligned with the EU acquis. Serbia continued to align its secondary legislation with the EU acquis. A new strategy and action plan in this area were adopted in October 2024. In 2024, labour inspectors carried out 1,025 inspections regarding fatal, serious with fatal outcome, serious, collective and minor injuries at work. The number of reported workplace fatalities increased in 2024 (59 cases, from 42 in 2023), with most cases occurring in construction and industry.\n\nSocial dialogue, and the involvement of social partners in policy developments relevant to them, remain weak. The last period marked by protests and work stoppages in the education sector confirmed the need to amend the law on strike without further delay as the current law of 1996 is outdated and not in line with ILO standards. In this context, the salaries of teachers participating in protests were severely reduced. No new sectoral collective bargaining agreements were signed.Some complaints brought up to ILO about the infringement of trade union and workers\u2019 rights have not been resolved yet.\n\nOn employment policy, budget allocations for active labour market policies decreased in 2025 and remain below 0.1% of GDP despite the employment action plan\u2019s target of 0.16%. The public employment advisers to job seekers ratio is too low. A Youth Guarantee pilot scheme has been implemented in three employment offices since January 2024. The scheme is expected to reduce youth unemployment (23% in 2024 for the 15-24 population) and NEET rate (14.9% in 2024 for people aged 15-29) (see also Chapter 26 \u2013 Education and culture). Regarding labour force participation and unemployment rate see the statistical annex and the section on the functioning of the labour market under 2.3 Economic criteria.\n\nIn the area of social protection and inclusion, in 2024, according to the latest survey on income and living conditions (SILC), the at-risk-of-poverty or social exclusion rate amounted to 24.3%, compared to 27.2% in 2023. Public expenditure on social protection and budget transfers as a share of GDP are still low. Serbia needs to address the ECRI\u2019s recommendations of June 2024 on the decision-making process of the Social Card and its impact on Roma and other vulnerable individuals. The ECRI called for a review involving equality bodies and CSOs, with \u2018particular emphasis on ensuring transparency in the operation of algorithmic systems [\u2026], developing effective remedies and establishing a powerful oversight mechanism\u2019. There is a need for legislative adjustments and improvement of the coverage and adequacy of financial social assistance. A new strategy for social protection and amendments to the law on social welfare are seriously delayed. The Law on Financial Support to Family with Children was amended in September 2024 to increase several allowances but the recommendation of 2022 of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to remove discriminatory conditions was not addressed. Means-tested social assistance programmes do not sufficiently reach the poor, a large share of children living in poverty are not covered by any benefit, and the social protection system remains understaffed. The system of earmarked transfers to the local level is still not implemented systematically or transparently. Following an invitation by the Commission, Serbia nominated a national Contact Point for the European Child Guarantee. In the area of de-institutionalisation, an action plan to implement the related strategy is seriously delayed.\n\nIn the field of non-discrimination in employment and social policy, Serbia still needs to fully align with the relevant EU acquis, including the Employment Equality Directive, the Racial Equality Directive, the Directive and Council Directive on standards for equality bodies. Most complaints received by Serbia\u2019s Commissioner for the Protection of Equality are related to the area of employment (see also Chapter 23 \u2013 Judiciary and fundamental rights).\n\n![Image 40](blob:http://localhost/429fbbc286f3d0a1d1451aba15be2282)In the area of equal opportunities for women and men in employment and social policy, Serbia still needs to fully align with the EU acquis, including the Directive on Work-Life Balance, the Pay Transparency Directive and the Women on Boards Directive. The position of women on the labour market in Serbia remains unfavourable compared with the position of men. The employment rate for men (20-64 year olds) is 13.9 percentage points higher and their activity rate is 13.2 percentage points higher than those for women. The gender pay gap is 14.5%. The suspension of the gender equality law by the Constitutional Court has suspended the legal obligation for employers to report on gender equality in the workplace, including on the principle of equal pay for equal work. The gender pension gap stands at 16.8%. Although the legislation grants access to parental leave to both parents, gender-based stereotypical preconceptions persist about childcare and household work being a woman\u2019s responsibility. The lack of State services for childcare in rural areas also increases the amount of unpaid household work for women. Maternity, paternity and parental leave rights in the legislation are not aligned with the EU acquis. Sustained efforts are needed to ensure that anti-discrimination commitments translate into consistent practice, particularly in under-resourced municipalities.\n\nThere were no developments as regards preparations for the European Social Fund (see also Chapter 22 - Regional policy and coordination of structural instruments).\n\nChapter 20 - Enterprise and industrial policy\n\nEU industrial policy strengthens competitiveness, facilitates structural change and encourages a business-friendly environment that stimulates small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\nConcerning industrial policy, the institutional and policy framework is largely in place. Serbia continues to implement its strategy for industrial development 2021-2030 and the accompanying 2024-2025 action plan. Serbia should timely adopt a new action plan for the subsequent period.\n\nSerbia continues to use budgetary subsidies for newly created jobs as an incentive for foreign direct investments. This approach is not consistent with its industrial policy goal of privileging value added over labour cost, and with the continued need to better integrate SMEs into domestic and international supply chains.\n\nRegarding enterprise policy, reforms concerning the ownership and management of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are advancing primarily through the implementation of the SOE strategy and related action plans, and the new SOE law which entered into force in September 2024. Proper implementation of the new law is dependent on 11 pieces of implementing legislation, of which 5 have been timely adopted. Serbia continues to make progress on its privatisation and restructuring process of over 500 SOEs, in which 41 companies remain.\n\nSerbia\u2019s SME development strategy for 2023-2027 is being implemented. However, Serbia has yet to adopt an action plan covering 2025-2027.\n\nSerbia should improve the predictability of the business environment, with an emphasis on ensuring that all relevant legislation undergoes timely and comprehensive public consultations, including through effective communication of the e-consultation portal.\n\nSerbia has a range of enterprise and industrial policy instruments in place, including grants, subsidies, tax exemptions and guarantee schemes. The budget for measures supporting SMEs and entrepreneurship is growing but remains modest. Serbia participates in the SME Pillar of the Single Market Programme.\n\nOn combating late payments in commercial transactions, Serbia\u2019s legislation is largely aligned with the EU acquis. However, Serbia continues not to be aligned with its rules on payments, indemnity interest rates, expedited recovery procedures and compensation.\n\nOn sectoral policies, Serbia has a number of sector-specific strategies including in the areas of energy, transport, education, media, artificial intelligence (see also chapters 10 on Digital transformation and media, 14 on Transport, 15 on Energy and 26 on Education and culture) and tourism. In addition, Serbia is implementing its smart specialisation strategy (see also Chapter 25 on Science and research).\n\nChapter 25 - Science and research\n\nThe EU provides significant support to research and innovation. All Member States can participate in the EU\u2019s research and innovation programmes and benefit from them, especially where there is scientific excellence and solid investment in research and innovation.\n\nOn research and innovation policy, Serbia is implementing its 2021-2025 strategy for development of a start-up ecosystem. Work is ongoing to align with the European Research Infrastructure Consortium regulation.\n\nDuring the reporting period, worrying developments took place impacting the institutional autonomy of research and academic institutions and academic freedom. In March 2025, the government adopted two Decrees restricting the amount of time academic staff can spend on research activities. Their implementation resulted in a decrease in the salaries of teaching researchers to only 12.5% during the interruption of the academic year and retroactive payments of full salaries conditioned to the completion of the 2024/2025 academic year. These measures also undermine the eligibility of Serbian researchers to apply to certain European Research Council (ERC) grants and limit the effectiveness of the cooperation between academia and the private sector as part of the Quadruple Helix.\n\nIn July and August, central and local authorities dismissed board members of two major research institutes, and the management in one of the two, and nominated new members. Some of these decisions are challenged before the courts for allegedly not following the requirements set in the Law on Science and Research.\n\nThe Science Fund is operational as a funding mechanism with an increasing number of 13 funded programmes under a total budget of EUR 106.5 million.\n\nThe national level of investment in research remains low at 0.88% of GDP in 2023 (0.92% in 2022). Serbia is in the fifth year of implementing its Smart Specialisation strategy, with the second action plan extending to the end of 2025.\n\nConcerning innovation measures, the Innovation Fund, four science and technology parks and 14 new incubators continue to be active with increasing financial contributions. While the Innovation Fund\u2019s Katapult accelerator and Serbia Ventures Programme (with investments of up to EUR 5 million) have positive impact on the innovation ecosystem, the number of validated European patents is modest. Further integration into the new European Innovation Agenda and activities of the European Innovation Council is strongly encouraged.\n\nSerbia is an Emerging Innovator in the European innovation scoreboard, with a score of 51.5 in 2025 \u2013 above the average of the emerging innovators group. The performance gap with the EU is nonetheless increasing. Private sector research and innovation expenditure is increasing.\n\nAs regards the EU Framework programmes, Serbia takes an active part in Horizon Europe as an associated country. Serbia is also successfully participating in EUREKA and the European Cooperation in Science and Technology.\n\nChapter 26 - Education and culture\n\nThe EU supports cooperation in education and culture through funding programmes and the coordination of Member State policies through the \u2018open method of coordination\u2019. The EU and the Member States must also prevent discrimination and ensure quality education for children of migrant workers, including those from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nIn the area of education and training, the policy framework and the institutional framework are in place. There is a certain vulnerability for corruption in the sector as a whole and for higher education in particular. Serbia continued to implement its 2030 education strategy and its action plan with delays.\n\nThere was a discontinuity in the delivery of education on all levels, especially in higher education, throughout the 2024/2025 school year due to students\u2019 protests and blockades which were joined by education staff. Education delivery resumed gradually according to a new calendar to mitigate the impact of missed classes. During protests, cases of attacks and threats against students and professors were recorded.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2025/2026 school year, a significant number of principals were dismissed and temporary contracts of some teachers in primary and secondary education were not renewed. Serbia\u2019s Commissioner for the Protection of Equality launched proceedings over complaints of discrimination based on political or union activity. This raises concern in terms of erosion academic freedom, institutional autonomy and the quality of education in the context of persistent teacher shortages.\n\nIn March 2025, Serbia adopted amendments to four framework laws concerning primary, secondary and higher education. The draft amendments to the Law on Textbooks adopted by the government which would give exclusive rights to a public publisher for producing textbooks for subjects such as the Serbian language, geography, history and arts risk affecting the quality of textbooks and education and politicizing curriculum.\n\nThe level of public spending on education in Serbia in 2023 is modest around 3.2%, which is below the EU average of 4.6% of GDP. Public expenditures for higher education increased by 20%, namely for staff, material costs and scholarships. At the same time, a severe cut of salaries and operational costs across the education system was made on the account of discontinued delivery of classes in the context of the protests but are retroactively being paid conditioned with the completion of the 2024/2025 academic year. The student population continues to decrease due to negative demographic trends and emigration.\n\nThe coverage of children with early childhood education and care education (ECEC) is stable at 62.1 % in 2024 (61.2% in 2023) for age 6 months to 6.5 years. However, further efforts are needed to increase participation in preschool education, including through ensuring equitable ECEC for the most disadvantaged children. The enrolment rate in mandatory ECEC has been broadly stable, though decreasing to 96.2% during the 2024/2025 school year (97.2% in 2023/2024).\n\nIn December 2024, Serbia adopted new standards of achievement for all three cycles of pre-university education. The introduction of final examinations in secondary education was postponed to the 2028/2029 school year. The rate of early school leavers slightly increased to 6.2% in 2024 (5.8% in 2023). Serbia should commit sufficient funding and human resources for sustained participation in international assessments. Findings of the TIMMS 2023 survey indicate more favourable results among fourth graders, where Serbian students achieved results above the international average in mathematics and science. Serbia conducted the TALIS 2024 but postponed the PISA 2025 testing to autumn 2025.\n\nSerbia should continue to modernise the curricula to improve VET relevance and further develop the national work-based learning model for VET. The employment rate of VET graduates (aged 20-34) is low but slightly increased to 67.3% in 2024 (65.6% in 2023). The lack of opportunities for reskilling and upskilling is a structural barrier to youth and adult employment which should be addressed. Work on the recognition of informal and non-formal training is progressing slowly and is yet to be scaled up systematically. Serbia is a member of the European Alliance for Apprenticeships (EAfA) and should encourage regional and local stakeholders to join the network.\n\nSerbia is a member of the European Higher Education Area (Bologna process). Three Serbian universities participate in European Universities alliances. Amendments to the Law on Higher Education which brought in the possibility of micro credentials should be fully operationalised to facilitate additional lifelong learning opportunities. Lifelong learning participation decreased to 5.5% in 2024 (6.1% in 2023).\n\nOn quality assurance in higher education, no progress was made in the implementation of recommendations of the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ENQA). An application for renewed membership in ENQA has yet to be submitted by the National Accreditation Body after its suspension in 2020. First qualification standards for higher education have been developed but are yet to be linked with quality assurance procedures. The attainment of tertiary level qualifications for people aged 25-34 slightly increased to 37.2% in 2024 (34.7% in 2023), significantly below the 2030 EU target of 45%.\n\nMeasures to reduce drop-out rates and segregation need to be enforced focusing also on the inclusion of women and girls in education and training. The number of students supported by individual education plans increased significantly in the 2024/2025 school year. Children with disabilities still do not have access to teaching assistants. The issue of children in residential institutions who are not attending education or have dropped out needs to be adequately addressed. Free textbooks are provided for an extended number of vulnerable categories of students. The education system has demonstrated flexibility in integrating migrants. The assistive technology resource centres need to become fully operational to provide additional services for inclusive education. The Criminal Code was amended with rules setting out penalties for assault and violence against people employed in education. Mechanisms for prevention of, and protection against, violence and discrimination need to be fully implemented, and monitoring strengthened.\n\nSerbia\u2019s digital transformation of the education system is ongoing including developing infrastructure and teacher digital competencies. Although the pre-university level curricula include mandatory subjects to develop digital skills, according to the 2023 International Computer and Information Literacy Study survey 67% of students lack sufficient competency to use digital technologies independently, safely and with critical thinking. The development of the education management information system still requires further consolidation. Further efforts are needed to align digital education with the EU\u2019s 2021-2027 digital education action plan. Serbia has yet to incorporate green and environmental topics into its curricula.\n\nSerbia has been successfully participating in the Erasmus+ programme as an associated country since 2019. In 2024, Serbian organisations participated in 794 Erasmus+ projects,of which in more than 230 projects as project coordinators for a total contracted grant amount of EUR 19.4 million. Serbia is participating in all the European Education Area 2021-2025 working groups.\n\nRegarding youth, Serbia is implementing the youth strategy and the Youth Guarantee action plans. The expenditures from the national budget for youth policy increased by 25% in 2025 compared to 2024. The legislation on youth, volunteering and internship has not been revised yet. The National Youth Council was re-constituted in October 2024. Despite increased efforts, youth policy and support mechanisms remain unevenly developed at local level.\n\nOn sports, Serbia is successfully implementing the third call for proposals for mobility projects in the area of sport and continued to participate in the European Week of Sport.\n\nOn culture, Serbia has been implementing its strategic priorities for cultural development for the period 2021-2025. However, the adoption of the overarching cultural development strategy is still pending. Serbia has ratified and continues to implement the 2005 UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions at both national and local levels. Serbia fully participates in the 2021-2027 Creative Europe Programme. The \u2018Creative Europe Festival,\u2019 held across the country, further increases visibility and awareness of the programme. The Serbian cultural and creative sector has over the past year faced challenges with reduced funding and limited institutional support.\n\nChapter 29 - Customs union\n\nAll Member States are part of the EU customs union and follow the same customs rules and procedures. This requires legislative alignment as well as adequate implementing and enforcement capacity, and access to and interoperability with the EU electronic customs environment.\n\nSerbia\u2019s customs legislation is largely aligned with the EU acquis. In December 2024, Serbia further aligned its Regulation on customs procedures and customs formalities. A large number of implementing legislation related to the classification of certain goods was also adopted during the reporting period. Serbia is a party to the Common Transit Convention and to the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention on rules of origin, including the transitional provisions that entered into force in January 2025. Serbia regularly harmonises its customs tariff nomenclature with the EU combined nomenclature, including for 2025. Serbia has an authorised economic operator programme and has issued a total of 66 certificates for authorised economic operators. Full alignment with the EU acquis is still needed concerning free zones. Fees are still charged at some border crossing points on lorries entering customs terminals to discharge customs obligations, which is not in line with Serbia\u2019s SAA obligations. In terms of the administrative and operational capacity, the customs laboratory remains underequipped, and the risk management system must be strengthened. To fully align on security aspects, Serbia should consistently carry out pre-arrival/pre-departure risk-based analysis, in line with the EU Customs Code. In 2024, total revenues collected by the customs administration increased by 11% year-on-year. The administrative capacity for the control of illicit tobacco trade is insufficient. Serbia should continue to strengthen combating customs fraud, in particular smuggling of tobacco products and by cooperating with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).\n\nSerbia is a party to the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control but has yet to fully comply with its provisions including by establishing a track and trace system of tobacco products.\n\nSerbia continued to cooperate with EU Member States and OLAF under Protocol 6 of the SAA on mutual administrative assistance in customs matters in particular in order to investigate suspected cases of circumvention via its territory and/or by legal entities registered in Serbia of EU sanctions adopted in the context of Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine.\n\nCluster 4: The green agenda and sustainable connectivity\n\nThis cluster covers: transport (Chapter 14); energy (Chapter 15); trans-European networks (Chapter 21); and environment and climate change (Chapter 27).\n\nChapter 14: Transport policy\n\nThe EU has common rules for technical and safety standards, security, social standards, State aid and market liberalisation in road transport, railways, inland waterways, multimodal transport, aviation and maritime transport.\n\nFor the general transport acquis, Serbia must finalise and adopt its National Transport Strategy, while ensuring a transparent and inclusive consultation process. Subsequently, Serbia needs to update the general transport master plan and integrate it with capital budgeting. The improvement of administrative capacity in the road and rail sectors should continue. Serbia actively engages in the work of the Transport Community (TCT) and implemented the five TCT action plans, which ended in 2024. Serbia should now focus on the implementation of the next generation action plans 2025-2027. For larger transport agglomerations, sustainable urban mobility plans that adhere to environmental and social standards should be developed in accordance with EU practice.\n\n![Image 41](blob:http://localhost/91e587c06bf3dd8c66572cfe8816280b)On road transport, alignment with the EU acquis is at a good level and remains a priority. The institutional framework is in place, however, agencies responsible for road maintenance and construction lack full independence in carrying out their mandates. Road maintenance, including its financing, should ensure the sustainability of investments in road infrastructure and adhere to the \u2018user pays\u2019 principle. Serbia is committed to implementing EU-Western Balkans green lanes by updating working regimes at border crossing points with EU Member States, expanding border crossings along main corridors, including parking facilities, and promoting the use of digital waybills. The Road Safety Strategy for 2023-2030 and its three-year action plan should continue to be implemented, including more systemic use of tools supporting road safety improvements. The exchange of data with the European Commission, in accordance with the EU CARE protocol, should also be maintained. Social and market rules in the field of road transport must be fully transposed. In this context, the transition to smart tachograph technology is an important step.\n\nOn rail transport, there is a high level of alignment with the EU acquis. The Railway Directorate, which acts as the regulatory body, licensing authority, and safety authority, should be further strengthened. The investment pipeline in railway infrastructure continues to grow. However, the legal, technical, administrative, and institutional frameworks relevant for the preparation and implementation of investment projects need to be thoroughly reassessed to tackle significant delays and administrative weaknesses currently causing ineffective use of resources. Current maintenance practices of railway infrastructure must be systemically improved to provide an adequate balance between infrastructure capacity and safety standards, as well as to ensure sustainability of ongoing and planned investments in railway infrastructure modernisation. Alignment with the fourth EU Railway Package should continue, notably by ensuring the adoption of the new Law on railways. Formal adoption of the EU technical specifications for interoperability remains pending, as does full alignment with the rail safety and interoperability acquis. The European Rail Traffic Management System should be fully and transparently implemented.\n\nOn maritime transport, Serbia is at a high level of alignment with the EU acquis. Serbia should continue aligning with international conventions.\n\nRegarding inland waterway transport, there is a high level of alignment with the EU acquis. The institutional framework is in place; however, vessel traffic services need to be further strengthened. Serbia\u2019s operational river information services system is highly interoperable with those of EU Member States. Serbia should continue efforts to meet all requirements in the ongoing process of recognition of certificates in inland waterways including the connection to European Crew Data Base.\n\nOn aviation, Serbia maintains a good level of alignment with the EU acquis. Good level of implementation of EU safety acquis in the domain of air crew licencing was confirmed during the EASA inspection conducted in June 2025. No progress was made in lifting the suspension of articles on the licensing of air carriers or in normalising the lower airspace regime over Kosovo.\n\nMultimodal transport policy should focus on improving the operational connectivity of various transport modes. Administrative capacity for multimodal transport needs to be further strengthened. A company in charge of operating the intermodal terminal in Batajnica was established in 2023, however, the terminal is still not yet fully operational, and customs services need to become functional at the terminal. Serbia has not yet aligned with the Combined Transport Directive.\n\nNo progress was made on EU passenger rights reforms.\n\nChapter 15 - Energy\n\nEU energy policy covers energy supply, infrastructure, the internal energy market, consumers, renewable energy, energy efficiency, nuclear energy, nuclear safety, radiation protection and nuclear safeguards.\n\nOn security of supply, Serbia took decisive steps in establishing the legal and institutional framework for the unbundling of the gas sector in line with the Third Energy Package, and Transportgas company was conditionally certified in March 2025. However, additional steps are pending, while the certification of the Banatski Dvor underground gas storage facility continues to experience significant delay.\n\nSerbia maintained a high level of alignment with the EU acquis on emergency oil stocks. The Law on energy adopted in November 2024, together with Governmental Decree on Risk Preparedness in the Electricity Sector adopted in May 2025 aim at full transposition of Regulation (EU) 2019/941 on risk-preparedness in the electricity sector. Adoption of the Electricity Risk Preparedness Plan is still pending.\n\nRegarding internal energy markets, alignment with and implementation of the Gas Storage Regulation is further delayed. In May 2025, the current gas supply contract with Russia was extended by four months. Serbia should align to the EU policy of reducing gas dependence on Russia and address the issue of Russian majority control over its gas and oil industry. On 9 October, the US started implementing sanctions against Serbia\u2019s largest oil company NIS due to the company\u2019s ownership structure, in which the majority of shares (56%) are held by Gazprom Neft (50%) and Gazprom subsidiary.\n\nSerbia has not yet enabled transparent and non-discriminatory third-party access to gas infrastructure, most notably to the interconnection transmission capacity. The development of competition and liquid trading of capacity and gas in Serbia is still lacking.\n\nThe amendments to the Law on energy adopted in November 2024, accompanied by Governmental Decrees transposing all five Network Codes and Guidelines adopted in the course of 2025, aim at transposing the Electricity Integration Package and therefore facilitate the integration of Serbia\u2019s electricity market with the EU market. Serbia continued its alignment with the Electricity Regulation 714/2009 to enable coordinated cross-border capacity allocation. However, the electricity transmission company EMS has not made progress on determining net transmission capacities and capacity allocation at the interconnection with Kosovo Transmission System Operator (KOSTT). Trading volumes on the organised electricity day-ahead market increased by 16.1% in 2024 compared to 2023.\n\nRegarding renewable energy, in March 2025, the Ministry of Mining and Energy successfully completed the second auction process for wind and solar power plants (300 MW for wind and 124.8 MW for solar). The total capacity of new renewable sources supported by these schemes reached 770 MW.\n\nSerbia further aligned with the Renewable Energy Directive (REDII), particularly by introducing mandatory certification for renewable energy installers and strengthening the regulation of energy communities and prosumers. Additionally, the Regulation on sustainability criteria for biofuels, bioliquids, and biomass fuels was adopted. However, Serbia is yet to establish a national traceability system for these fuels. Further alignment is needed, especially regarding the implementation of energy communities and the introduction of advanced biofuels and Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs).\n\nOn energy efficiency, no progress was made in aligning with the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, while institutional capacity for implementing energy efficiency projects and measures continues to require substantial strengthening.\n\nRegarding energy labelling and eco-design Serbia continued alignment with the Energy Labelling Regulation by adopting rulebooks for energy related products. However, only limited progress was achieved in aligning with the eco-design for the Sustainable Products Regulation.\n\nRegarding governance, in November 2024, Serbia adopted the Energy Development Strategy until 2040, with projections to 2050, outlining a pathway toward climate neutrality through decarbonisation measures, including the expansion of renewable energy sources, enhancement of energy efficiency, and the introduction of emission pricing mechanisms. In July 2025, Serbia adopted the Just Transition action plan, as a milestone to accelerate coal phase out. Serbia should now establish the Just Transition governance process in accordance with the action plan.\n\nAs regards nuclear energy, nuclear safety and radiation protection, Serbia\u2019s legislation is partially in line with the Euratom acquis. The ban on the construction of nuclear power plants was lifted in December 2024. Licensing of two old storage facilities, two research nuclear reactors and an abandoned uranium mine has yet to be finalised. The Serbian Parliament has still not ratified the European Community Urgent Radiological Information Exchange (ECURIE) Agreement. The capacity of the Serbian Radiation and Nuclear Safety and Security Directorate (SRBATOM) needs further strengthening in order to fulfil its future obligations also taking into account ongoing activities for the possible use of nuclear energy.\n\nOn nuclear safeguards, upon EU accession, the existing systems of accountancy and control of nuclear materials in Serbia would need to be adapted to accommodate for the safeguards provisions of the Euratom Treaty.\n\nChapter 21 - Trans-European networks\n\nThe EU promotes trans-European networks (TENs) in the areas of transport, telecommunications and energy to strengthen the internal market and contribute to growth and employment.\n\nOn transport networks, the legislative framework is partially aligned with the EU acquis.\n\nSerbia continues to develop transport projects within the trans-European networks. The preparation of technical and tender documentation for the implementation of TEN-T projects in road and rail needs to be accelerated. Feasibility studies and Environmental and Social Impact Assessments with active stakeholders\u2019 engagement should remain central to ensuring the quality of technical project documentation. Serbia needs to take into account the new TEN-T Regulation requirements and standards.\n\nRegarding roads, for the works on the Ni\u0161-Merdare highway, to date, only around 10% of approved EU grant funds have been utilised, and the tendering of the remaining sections has been further delayed and postponed until the end of 2025. The preparation of missing project documentation for the Plo\u010dnik-Merdare section, for which EU funds have also been secured, has been pending for an extended period.\n\nRegarding rail infrastructure, works related to the modernisation of the Ni\u0161\u2013Dimitrovgrad railway and the Ni\u0161 railway bypass are progressing at a very slow pace. Testing and completion of works on the remaining part of the Budapest-Belgrade line (the Novi Sad\u2013Subotica sub-section) have been slowed down due to the tragic accident at the Novi Sad railway station. Tenders for the selection of contractors on sections 3 and 2 of Rail Corridor X are to be launched, while preparatory activities related to Section 1 should be accelerated. Scoping for the modernisation of the Belgrade and Ni\u0161 railway junctions should be carried out to facilitate budgeting and project preparation activities. The works on lot one of the Stala\u0107\u2013Djunis sub-section, funded by the national budget, are significantly delayed, while the tendering procedure for lot 2 has been completed, but the works contract has not yet been signed.\n\nSerbia is part of the new Western Balkans\u2013Eastern Mediterranean European Transport Corridor and is therefore expected to be constructive in EU-funded projects implemented across the region, enhancing regional connectivity.\n\nTransposition of the revised TEN-E Regulation is delayed. Serbia should transpose it in its national legislation, with the aim to accelerate permitting procedures and enable development of key infrastructure projects with the neighbouring countries.\n\nSerbia continues to develop energy projects within the trans-European energy networks. In January 2025, the gas interconnector between Serbia and Bulgaria (IBS) began commercial operations after receiving a usage permit. However, an unrestricted third-party access regime and an open capacity allocation procedure on a non-discriminatory basis in line with the Energy Community acquis, the IPA 2017 Financing Agreement and Serbia\u2019s own commitments under the Reform Agenda remain to be fully implemented. Regarding the Trans-Balkan electricity corridor, the contract for the construction of a double circuit 400 kV transmission line included in the Section III from Obrenovac to Bajina Ba\u0161ta has been signed and works began in June 2025. Assistance for the preparation of tender documentation for Section IV from Bajina Ba\u0161ta to Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina is ongoing. Serbia also initiated the drafting of the spatial plan for the \u201cPannonian corridor\u201d project.\n\nChapter 27 - Environment and climate change\n\nThe EU promotes strong climate action, sustainable development and protection of the environment. EU rules contain provisions addressing climate change, water and air quality, waste management, nature protection, industrial pollution, chemicals, noise and civil protection.\n\nEnvironment\n\nThe institutional framework is in place but should be improved as the environmental sector competencies are scattered across several Ministries. Overall coordination and capacity of local self-governments and public utilities companies, in particular in the water sector, should be strengthened.\n\nIn the area of horizontal legislation, the legislative framework has a high level of alignment with the EU acquis.In November 2024, the Parliament adopted the Law on environmental impact assessment (EIA) and the Law on strategic environmental assessment (SEA). It is now important to ensure swift implementation of the legislation for all projects, including for EXPO 2027, prior to issuing construction permits.\n\nPublic participation and consultations processes did not improve compared to the previous reporting period. Serbia should continue to enhance inter-ministerial coordination Official reports and information about ongoing infrastructure investments and their environmental impact should be made publicly available by the Ministry of Environmental Protection.\n\nTransboundary cooperation did not improve during the reporting period. Serbia should continue its efforts to implement the Espoo Convention, to strengthen collaboration with neighbouring countries and begin implementing the activities outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation in the field of environmental protection with Bulgaria.\n\nThe number of inspection cases and issuance of offences increased, however, the alignment with the Environmental Liability Directive remains at an early stage, while alignment with the Environmental Crime Directive and its implementation needs to be improved.\n\nIn the field of air quality, Serbia maintains a high level of alignment with the EU acquis. In June 2025, Serbia adopted a new Law on air protection. Further alignment is encouraged with the latest air quality acquis, as well as alignment with the EU air quality index. In January 2025, civil society organisations took legal action against the authorities due to the lack of information on air pollution levels in Leskovac, Prokuplje, Po\u017eega, and In\u0111ija, where real-time data was allegedly not available to citizens. Three local air quality plans were adopted for Zrenjanin, Valjevo and Zaje\u010dar. Serbia continued to replace inefficient and polluting boilers in public buildings across the country.\n\nRegarding waste management, Serbia has a good level of alignment with the EU acquis, however, implementation progresses slowly and remains limited. The waste prevention plan 2025\u20132030 together with four implementing laws were adopted during the reporting period. There is still a need to implement extended producers\u2019 responsibility system for specific waste streams, in accordance with the polluter pays principle. The Duboko waste management centre was closed, leading to the waste being redirected to unsanitary landfills. Landfill fires broke out in several cities during the summer 2025, prompting emergency actions from central and local authorities. Efforts at closing unsanitary landfills are ongoing and should intensify. The Belgrade waste incinerator has been operational since November 2024. Serbia has ratified the Parma declaration for prevention of diseases caused by exposure to asbestos, and also the Ostrava declaration supporting provisions of the Parma declaration.\n\nThe level of alignment with the EU acquis on water quality remains partial. The institutional framework in the water sector is fragmented and not adequately adapted to the increasing level of investments. Improving local governance and technical skills, especially regarding the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater treatment facilities, remains a priority. Serbia needs to accelerate the adoption of the new water Law in line with the EU acquis, as well as the Law on drinking water.\n\nAlignment in the field of nature protection, particularly with the Habitats and Birds Directives and the EU\u2019s latest acquis on nature restoration, remains partial and the adoption of the new Law on nature protection is still pending. In the reporting period, the surface of protected areas was expanded. Serbia should further intensify efforts to identify and pre-designate sites for inclusion in the Natura 2000 network. Institutional and human resource capacity at both national and local levels remains weak, especially in relation to enforcement capacity and control of wildlife trade. Novi Sad received the Ramsar Wetland City accreditation in July 2025.\n\nAs regards industrial pollution and risk management, alignment with the EU acquis remains partial. During the reporting period, 62 new Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) permits were issued out of a total of 220 required. Significant progress was achieved in the area of hazard risk management, with the adoption in November 2024 of the new Law on the control of major accidents involving dangerous substances together implementing legislation. Serbia is encouraged to adopt the remaining implementing legislation. In the reporting period, Serbia adopted the Law on ratification of the Minamata Convention on mercury.\n\nSerbia has a high level of alignment with the EU acquis on chemicals.\n\nThere is partial alignment with the EU acquis on noise.Serbia should adopt the three prepared implementing laws under the Law on environmental noise protection. The strategic noise map for Belgrade Airport was adopted in June 2024. Serbia needs to continue developing noise maps for Belgrade, Subotica, and Kragujevac, as well as corresponding action plans, and ensure the enforcement of noise legislation.\n\nRegarding civil protection, Serbia actively contributes to and participates in the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM) and provided critical energy infrastructure to Ukraine through the EU\u2019s Emergency Response Coordination Centre. Serbia possesses a legal and policy framework for disaster risk management, however, the new disaster risk reduction strategy and the new Law on disaster risk reduction and emergency management remain to be adopted. The Disaster Risk Register, in line with the EU INSPIRE Directive and the EU initiative to enhance data interoperability, is regularly updated. Serbia should establish the trans-European Services for Telematics between Administrations (TESTA) as a prerequisite for connecting to the Common Emergency Communication and Information System (CECIS).\n\nClimate change\n\nSerbia has some preparedness in the area of climate change, but enforcement is at an early stage. Limited progress was achieved during the reporting period.\n\nSerbia advanced on implementation of Monitoring Reporting Verification and Accreditation (MRVA) acquis. Trainings on carbon pricing and GHG applications for relevant stakeholders continued. The greenhouse gas registry has been operational since October 2024 and so far, 93 permits were issued. Guidance documents are publicly available through the platform. Serbia is encouraged to expand its legislative alignment with and implementation of MRVA acquis to cover the full EU ETS scope, thus including aviation, shipping and ETS2 sectors. There was some preparatory work for the introduction of a national carbon tax.\n\nSerbia\u2019s draft national spatial plan, based on its energy strategy, includes the construction and operation of new thermal power plants, which could jeopardise Serbia\u2019s ability to fulfil its climate targets and align with those of the EU. Serbia should set a coal phase-out date as an effective means to comply with its Green Agenda commitments on achieving climate neutrality by 2050. The country should update its Climate Law and Low Carbon Development Strategy to align with the EU\u2019s 2050 climate neutrality target. Serbia still needs fully align with EU acquis on fluorinated greenhouse gases, ozone-depleting substances, and emissions from the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector, vehicles and road transport.\n\nIn January and September 2025 respectively, Serbia submitted its first biennial transparency report and its new nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement. The new NDC sets a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emission by 40.1% (excluding the LULUCF sector) by 2035 which de facto means that most of the remaining mitigation efforts to reach low-carbon economy are postponed to after 2035.\n\nCluster 5: Resources, agriculture and cohesion\n\nThis cluster covers: agriculture and rural development (Chapter 11); food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy (Chapter 12); fisheries and aquaculture (Chapter 13); regional policy and coordination of structural instruments (Chapter 22); and financial and budgetary provisions (Chapter 33).\n\nChapter 11: Agriculture and rural development\n\nThe EU\u2019s common agricultural policy supports farmers and ensures Europe\u2019s food security. It helps tackle climate change and the sustainable management of national resources; maintains rural areas and landscapes across the EU; and keeps the rural economy alive by promoting jobs in farming, agri-food industries and associated sectors. This requires strong management and control systems. There are also common EU rules for marketing standards, quality policy and organic farming.\n\nRegarding horizontal issues, Serbia revised its action plan for the transposition, implementation and enforcement of the acquis in this area. A new, national strategy for the period 2025-2034 remains to be adopted.\n\nSerbia needs to make progress with the establishment of the integrated administration and control system (IACS) and the transition from manual to electronic processing of aid applications. The land parcel identification system (LPIS) software was developed. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management needs to ensure sufficient human resources to implement the LPIS and further develop IACS. The sample size and the collected data need to be further improved to ensure the development of the farm sustainability data network.\n\nIn the area of agricultural markets - common market organisation, there was no progress on the adoption of legislation. The Law on wine remains to be adopted.\n\nOn rural development, Serbia recorded further losses under the IPARD II programme in 2024 and absorbed only 56,6% of the available EU funding.\n\nRegarding IPARD III, there was limited progress with the rollover of entrusted IPARD measures. However,there was a lack of progress in the implementation, with no contracts signed yet and significant delays in the submission of entrustment requests for new measures. Serbia should urgently engage all efforts to contract and disburse IPARD III funds and significantly accelerate the entrustment of three new measures. The IPARD Agency\u2019s capacity needs to be further strengthened.\n\nAs regards quality policy, there was no progress. The Law on quality schemes still needs to be adopted.\n\nOn organic farming, the Law on organic production which would provide alignment with the EU acquis still needs to be adopted.\n\nOn the fight against corruption, the IPARD bodies are obliged to prevent, detect and report irregularities.\n\nChapter 12 - Food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy\n\nThe EU food acquis including hygiene rules for foodstuff production ensure a high level of food and feed safety, and a high level of protection of consumers\u2019 interests. Animal health and welfare, and the safety of food of animal origin, are safeguarded together with the quality of seeds, plant reproductive material, the protection against harmful organisms, animal nutrition and the use of plant protection products.\n\nThe legal and institutional framework for this Chapter is in place. However, the legal framework remains to be fully aligned with the EU acquis, while the institutional framework and capacities need to be considerably strengthened.\n\nIn the area of general food safety, Serbia still needs to adopt a strategy and action plan for alignment with the EU acquis. Only two out of sixteen foreseen framework laws which are aimed to align with the acquis were adopted in the reporting period. Serbia continues to apply an inefficient risk-based approach to food imports. In addition, Serbia introduced unannounced changes of import conditions for products of animal origin, which negatively impacted trade flows of those product categories (see also Chapter 30). This issue now seems to have been broadly addressed.\n\nOn veterinary policy, understaffing at the Veterinary Directorate remains a major challenge for the implementation capacity. Serbia implemented rabies vaccination campaigns in 2024 and 2025 on its entire territory and should continue to do so. Serbia needs to strengthen its rabies surveillance. Serbia still needs to meet some requirements for the start of exports of fresh eggs and fresh poultry, and pork meat to the EU. Alignment with the EU acquis on animal welfare remains ongoing.\n\nRegarding placing on the market of food, feed and animal by-products, additional efforts are needed to monitor and upgrade food establishments to EU standards. Further work is still needed to ensure full alignment with the EU acquis on the collection, storage and processing of animal by-products.\n\nOn food safety rules and its specific rules for feed, Serbia still needs to adopt the strategy/national programme for the improvement of milk quality. No progress was reported on aligning the permitted level of aflatoxins in milk with the EU acquis.\n\nIn the area of phytosanitary policy, some steps were taken in relation to the sustainable use of pesticides, but the relevant legislation remains to be fully implemented. The Plant Health Directorate also remains seriously understaffed, especially its policy departments. Amendments to two framework laws from this area, the Law on forest reproductive material and the Law on acceptance of agricultural plant varieties, were adopted in March 2025, aiming for alignment with the EU acquis.\n\nNo progress was reported on genetically modified organisms. Alignment in this area remains essential to advance negotiations on World Trade Organisation membership and is a prerequisite for opening this chapter.\n\nChapter 13 - Fisheries and aquaculture\n\nThe common fisheries policy lays down rules on fisheries management, protects living resources of the sea and limits the environmental impact of fisheries. This includes setting catch quotas, managing fleet capacity, rules on control and inspection, rules on markets and aquaculture and support for fisheries and coastal communities. Further, it promotes a sustainable aquaculture.\n\nWhile Serbia, as a landlocked country, only has inland fishing and aquaculture, it still needs to fully develop its currently limited institutional framework to address the relevant parts of the EU acquis under this chapter, in particular as a market country and in the field of aquaculture. The legal framework remains to be fully aligned with the EU acquis. During the reporting period, Serbia adopted an action plan to achieve full compliance with the EU acquis by the time of accession. This comprehensive document addresses the main actions to be undertaken in the field of fisheries.\n\nOn resource and fleet management, the EU acquis applicable to Serbia includes provisions on the European eel. Legislation on market policy remains to be aligned with the EU acquis.\n\nWhile the system for inspection and controls is generally in place, further improvements are needed, including coordination between the state bodies involved. Official controls of fishery products intended for export to the EU remain to be aligned with the EU acquis. The implementation of the rulebook on catch certification and full alignment of the legal framework on illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing has been repeatedly postponed and should be addressed as a matter of priority.\n\nIn the area of structural actions, the sector is eligible for support under IPARD, however, the first contracts have not yet been signed.\n\nIn the area of aquaculture, Serbia should adopt a strategic plan to facilitate the development of this economic activity and further align with the EU acquis.\n\nThere were no significant developments concerning State aid and international agreements.\n\nChapter 22 - Regional policy & coordination of structural instruments\n\nRegional policy is the EU\u2019s main tool for reducing regional disparities and investing in sustainable and inclusive socio-economic growth. It is operating through \u2018shared management\u2019 between the Commission and EU Member States. The implementation of cohesion policy programmes requires appropriate administrative capacity on programme and project level, the establishment of systems of sound financial management and control and also the fulfilment of other EU acquis elements such as environmental or public pro c urement legislation.\n\nOn legislative framework, Serbia still needs to adopt the law on cohesion policy, strengthen joint regional planning between central and local authorities and advance fiscal decentralisation to align responsibilities with financial resources. Since March 2025, regional planning is supported by the implementing legislation on public policy documents and regulatory impact assessment. By the end of the reporting period, 83% of the local self-governments had adopted local development plans, based on the principle of partnership. However, Serbia has still to adopt its national development plan to set policy priorities, recognise the development potential of the regions, and support efforts to reduce regional and local disparities. Compliance with enabling conditions remains monitored on a regular basis. More efforts are needed to promote sustainable and inclusive growth in the regions (see also Chapters 5, 8, 15, 17, 19 and 27).\n\nThe institutional framework for cohesion policy is largely in place, but responsibility for regional policy remains scattered among several ministries, and the potential of regional development agencies and local development offices is still underused. There are regular meetings to coordinate activities related to regional developments including the Chapter 22 action plan.\n\nThe potential of using European groupings of territorial cooperation in various policy instruments, as facilitators for integrated territorial governance and Interreg cooperation, remains untapped. Serbia demonstrates sufficient administrative capacity to manage EU funds. However, key institutions face understaffing, risking system disruptions and requiring urgent attention. The adoption of a retention policy remains a priority. Progress was made with the roadmap for building administrative capacity, mainstreaming the training on EU financing instruments and cohesion policy through the National Academy for Public Administration Training programme, certification of trainers on cohesion policy and ensuring good training dynamics and effectiveness. The existing training opportunities must be fully utilised to ensure timely implementation of the adopted operational programmes and seamless shift to ex-post controls.\n\nOn programming, Serbia adopted the Reform Agenda under the Reform and Growth Facility, completed the programming of the remaining IPA III funds, and launched the implementation of two operational programmes. Progress was achieved in public investment management with the budgeting of capital investment projects over a three-year horizon, the application of green tagging methodology for investments, and the upgrade of the Public Investment Management Information System, enabling efficient assessment, monitoring and reporting of green investments. Serbia continues to participate in six cross-border programmes and two transnational programmes: the EU Strategy for the Adriatic and Ionian Region and the EU Strategy for the Danube Region.\n\nSerbia benefits from a regulated and functioning monitoring and evaluation system, supported by an operational management information system. The Sector Monitoring Committees for the operational programmes need to be established, in line with the partnership principle.\n\nThe financial management, control and audit systems are functioning, as evidenced by the IPA contracting and disbursement rates and the low rejection rates. The strengthened audit system provides sufficient coverage and compliance with the international audit standards, although enhancing is needed to audit the IPA operational programmes and the Reform and Growth Facility. However, the understaffing of the National Authorising Officer Support Office, and the internal audit units of three ministries implementing EU assistance create critical risks.\n\nSerbia has to upscale the legal framework for fight against corruption and fraud with EU funds and funds from other sources, through adopting provisions on exchange of information with OLAF, as well as on authorising access to information, and technical and financial verifications by the European Commission, OLAF and the European Court of Auditors. Strengthening the capacities of the Department for combating irregularities and fraud dealing with European Union funds (AFCOS) remains essential (see also Chapter 32).\n\nChapter 33 - Financial and budgetary provisions\n\nThis chapter covers the rules governing the funding of the EU budget (\u2018own resources\u2019). These resources mainly consist of: (i) contributions based on the gross national income of each Member State; (ii) customs duties; (iii) non-recycled plastic; and (iv) a resource based on value-added tax. Member States must have the appropriate administrative capacity to adequately coordinate and ensure the correct calculation, collection, payment and control of own resources.\n\nThere was between limited to some progress in the underlying policy areas indirectly affecting the own resources system (for progress in these areas, see Chapters 16 \u2013 Taxation, 18 \u2013 Statistics, 29 \u2013 Customs union, and 32 \u2013 Financial control).\n\nRegarding traditional own resources, the customs legislation is largely aligned with the EU acquis.However, reporting is manual, and Serbia does not use OWNRES, or any other similar national electronic database, to report on fraud and irregularities for amounts over EUR 10 000.The current accounting system does not use two different accounts, one for collected or secured debts (A account) and the other for uncollected/unsecured debts or secured but appealed debts (B account).\n\nAs regards the VAT-based resource, sufficient data sources are available for the calculation of the weighted average rate, deriving from the supply and use tables that were published for the first time in 2019.\n\nRegarding administrative infrastructure, the capacity of the institutions in the relevant policy areas needs to be further strengthened, and the organisational and procedural links between the institutions involved in own resources should still be developed.\n\nCluster 6: External relations\n\nThere are two chapters in this cluster: external relations (Chapter 30) and foreign, security and defence policy (Chapter 31).\n\nChapter 30: External relations\n\nThe EU has a common commercial policy towards third countries, based on multilateral and bilateral agreements and autonomous measures. There are also EU rules on humanitarian aid and development policy.\n\nAs regards the common commercial policy, Serbia has yet to accede to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The process is stalled primarily due to the lack of progress on the adoption of a modified law on trade in genetically modified organisms, and on the completion of market access negotiations with a small number of WTO members. Furthermore, Serbia has yet to achieve full alignment with the EU acquis in line with its action plan on remaining preparations for EU accession under Chapter 30.\n\nSerbia should continue to play a constructive role in CEFTA and within the common regional market (CRM), in line with commitments taken in the context of the Berlin Process. Serbia should also continue to implement the new CRM action plan for 2025-2028 and decisions adopted in the context of CEFTA, including the nine decisions from October 2024 and the four from February 2025.\n\nSerbia has a tendency to introduce ad hoc trade restrictive measures against the spirit of the SAA. Quantitative import restrictions on sunflower oil and margarine adopted by Serbia in March 2024 and the export ban on wood pellets from April 2024 were lifted in March 2025, and export quotas for iron and steel scrap adopted in December 2024 were lifted in July. In addition, in May 2025 Serbia revoked import licences and terminated the issuance of new licences concerning a large number of dairy and meat products, significantly disrupting trade while adding to the list of trade restrictive measures taken over the past years. This issue now seems to have been broadly addressed. An export ban of arms and military equipment remain in place as of June. There are also systematically deteriorating conditions for imports of different types of products primarily of animal origin related to the practices of sanitary, phytosanitary and veterinary border inspections in terms of frequency, duration, volume and costs of sampling. Serbia should abstain from introducing unilateral trade restrictive measures, in line with its SAA obligations under Article 36. In addition, concerning the management of its wine quotas, Serbia is encouraged to revert to the open and transparent First Come First Served System, which is the system applied to all wine imports into the EU.\n\nSerbia continues to prevent circumvention of the EU restrictive measures adopted in the context of Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine via Serbian territory and/or by legal entities registered in Serbia. Serbia should continue to step up its efforts to fight sanctions circumvention including concerning the risk of trade triangulation.\n\nIn March 2025, Serbia adopted a new Law on dual-use goods aimed at further alignment with the latest EU acquis, namely Regulation (EU) 2021/821. Serbia regularly adopts a national control list of dual-use goods aimed at full alignment with the latest Co mmission Delegated Regulation. Serbia\u2019s applications to join the Wassenaar Arrangement and the Australia Group from 2009 and 2017 respectively, are still under consideration. Serbia has yet to align with the EU acquis on screening of foreign direct investments.\n\nSerbia continues to negotiate bilateral agreements with third countries. In October 2024, a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United Arab Emirates was signed, which entered into force on 1 June 2025. The FTA with Egypt signed in July 2024 entered into force in September 2025. In addition, negotiations on an FTA with South Korea are ongoing. Serbia has announced plans for an FTA with Israel. All the FTAs that Serbia negotiates must ensure compatibility with the EU acquis and include sunset clauses, which guarantee that Serbia can renounce the agreements upon accession to the EU. Serbia should also ensure that proper cost-benefit analyses are conducted before concluding any negotiations to minimise the risk of negative effects on specific sectors. Serbia has 50 Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) in force, of which 21 with EU Member States. In addition, a number of BITs are pending ratification. Serbia has also announced plans for new BITs with Bahrain, Uzbekistan, India, Kyrgyzstan, Equatorial Guinea, Japan and San Marino. Serbia is encouraged to develop a strategy for amending or terminating BITs that fall short of EU standards and expose the country to risks.\n\nSerbia\u2019s institutional framework is in place. However, the administrative capacity should be strengthened concerning trade with the EU and EFTA, related to completing the WTO accession and to collecting market statistics.\n\nRegarding development policy and humanitarian aid, development assistance and humanitarian aid are granted on an ad hoc basis.\n\nChapter 31 - Foreign, security and defence policy\n\nMember States must be able to conduct political dialogue under the EU foreign, security and defence policy, align with EU statements, take part in EU actions, and apply agreed sanctions and restrictive measures.\n\nThe political dialogue between the EU and Serbia on foreign and security policy continued. In April 2025, Serbia participated in the eleventh EU-Western Balkans meeting of Political Directors on CFSP. In April 2025, the Serbian Foreign Affairs Minister participated in the working dinner between the Foreign Ministers from Western Balkans and members of the Foreign Affairs Council.\n\nThe institutional framework enabling Serbia\u2019s participation in the EU common foreign and security policy and common security and defence policy is in place.\n\nIn the area of the EU\u2019s common foreign and security policy, Serbia needs, as a matter of priority, to make additional efforts to further align its foreign policy with the EU CFSP. Serbia\u2019s alignment with statements by the High Representative on behalf of the EU and Council decisions on sanctions remains low. As of 24 October 2025, the CFSP alignment is at 63% (compared to 59% in 2024), it increased in the last weeks after Serbia retroactively aligned with several Council decisions and EU statements, including some decisions listing Russian citizens and statements condemning Russia\u2019s actions.\n\nSerbia has not aligned with EU\u2019s restrictive measures against Russia, nor with a number of other statements and EU restrictive measures linked to Russia, China, Belarus, Iran , the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and destabilisation of the Republic of Moldova. It continues to operate flights to Russia, with increased frequency. Close cooperation and exchange of information between the EU and the national authorities is ongoing at technical level on sanctions circumvention and Serbia should maintain the existing good level of cooperation in this field. However, the fast-track acquisition of visa-free travel rights to the EU for nationals of Russia by granting them Serbian citizenship is a matter of concern. Serbia voted at the UN General Assembly in favour of establishing an International Day against Unilateral Coercive Measures, voting against the European Union position.\n\nSerbia continued to engage actively with international organisations. Serbia does not have a bilateral immunity agreement granting exemptions from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and complies with EU common positions on the integrity of the Rome Statute together with related EU\u2019s guiding principles on bilateral immunity agreements. The third action plan for the Implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security for the period 2024-2026 was adopted in April 2025; it does not explicitly refer to women CSOs nor to all women from vulnerable groups. Serbia also contributed to four UN peacekeeping missions (often joining the contingent of one EU Member State) and maintained its cooperation with NATO and its members. Serbia abstained from voting on the EU-supported UN General Assembly Resolution on Cooperation between the UN and the Council of Europe.\n\nSerbia continued to develop intense relations and strategic partnerships with a vast number of countries worldwide.High-level and frequent bilateral contacts with Russia intensified, combined with instances of anti-Western narratives, including the narrative characterising student protests as a foreign backed \u2018colour revolution\u2019, raising questions about Serbia\u2019s strategic direction. The Serbian President attended the Victory Day parade in Moscow on 9 May and held a bilateral meeting with the Russian President. They also met in September in Beijing. Frequent close contacts with Russian officials and ministers were maintained by a number of Serbian ministers, including through visits to Moscow. On 14 March 2025, Serbia was among the 41 countries supporting a joint statement delivered by the Russian Federation on their behalf at the UN Human Rights Council concerning the commemoration of the 80 th anniversary of Victory over Nazism on 9 May.\n\nWith Ukraine, Serbia is maintaining a balancing act. High-level contacts were also maintained with Ukraine, including a phone conversation between the two Presidents in December 2024 and May 2025. On 11 June 2025, the Serbian President attended the Southeast Europe-Ukraine summit in Odesa, marking his first visit to Ukraine since the start of the Russian aggression. Serbia supports the territorial integrity of Ukraine; however, it did not join the final Odesa declaration condemning Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine. In February 2025 Serbia publicly retracted its support to the EU-backed UN General Assembly Resolution \u2018Advancing a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine\u2019 marking the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine after the vote had taken place. Serbia continued providing humanitarian (including significant amounts of energy equipment) and financial assistance to Ukraine. Russia\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Service stated that ammunition produced in Serbia was supplied indirectly, via assembly in NATO countries, to Ukraine. Following pressure from Russia, Serbia announced the suspension of exports of arms and military equipment produced in Serbia and declared that any future such exports will require National Security Council approval.\n\nSerbia maintained frequent high-level contacts with China and participated in a joint military exercise with China in July 2025. President Vu\u010di\u0107 also attended the commemoration of the 80 th anniversary of WII and of the Sino-Japanese War in September in Beijing, where he also met with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nSerbia also pursued an active foreign policy with a wide range of countries from various continents, including the USA (having agreed to establish a strategic dialogue process), EU Member States, UK, T\u00fcrkiye, Israel, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Iran, and Uzbekistan. Serbia also strengthened its ties with African partners.\n\nSerbia continued supporting EU measures and documents on conflict prevention. Serbia also contributed to four UN peacekeeping missions (often joining the contingent of one EU Member State) and maintained its cooperation with NATO and its members.\n\nAs regards non-proliferation and disarmament, Serbia is implementing its 2023-2025 strategy and action plan for the fight against proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. As regards conventional weapons, Serbia continued to implement and engage positively on the new Western Balkans Regional Roadmap for a sustainable solution to the illegal possessions, misuse and trafficking of small arms and light weapons and their ammunition. Serbia should consider ratifying Protocol V on Explosive Remnants of War of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.\n\nSerbia is a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group but not yet of any other multilateral export control regime. Serbia has aligned with the EU Common Position 2008/944 defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment by revising the Law on export and import of arms and military equipment and adopting a new Law on the export and import of dual-use goods adopted in March 2025. Serbia established its National Control List of Arms and Military Equipment in July. The same month, the government adopted an export ban on arms and military equipment produced in Serbia, in a confidential decision, which subjects future exports to approval by the National Security Council.\n\nSerbia has a transparent reporting system on its strategic exports controls but allegations of corruption in arms trade deals need to be investigated. Serbia is a party to the Arms Trade Treaty but further measures to prevent diversion of arms and ammunition should be developed to support compliance. Serbia has not aligned with EU statements agreed in the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Conference of States Parties and Executive Council meetings in recent years and with related EU restrictive measures. In 2024 and 2025, Serbia has not systematically aligned with EU statements in the context of the UN Conference on Disarmament and the UN General Assembly First Committee and sometimes supported positions that were opposed by the EU. At the Arms Trade Treaty meetings, Serbia aligns with the EU on technical issues and general effectiveness of the Treaty, staying apart on political issues (Russia/Ukraine, China).\n\nIn terms of security measures, Serbia continued implementing its Security of Information Agreement with the EU on procedures for exchanging and protecting classified information.\n\nOn common security and defence policy (CSDP), Serbia continued to actively participate and contribute substantially to EU military crisis management missions and operations in Africa and to EUNAVFOR Atalanta in the Western Indian Ocean and in the Red Sea. Serbia still needs to put in place the legislation needed to implement the 2023 law on participation of civilians in international missions and operations, as well as the institutional framework required to become eligible to contribute to civilian CSDP missions. Serbia contributes to cooperation in military medicine through the Balkan Medical Task Force. Serbia also contributed to four UN peacekeeping missions (often joining the contingent of one EU Member State) and maintained its cooperation with NATO and its members.\n\nOn hybrid threats, foreign information manipulation and interference (FIMI), including disinformation, remain a matter of concern to be urgently addressed. In December 2024, the TV broadcaster Russia Today Balkan was officially launched and became available on channels and services of state operator Telekom Srbija. There have been worrying reports about Serbian citizens and the Serbian territory being involved in Russian hybrid operations, including subversive activities in the wake of Moldovan elections. As a consequence, a number of persons were detained by the Serbian authorities. On cyber in the context of international security, Serbia has actively engaged in the negotiations of the final report of the 2021-2025 Open Ended Working Group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies, including through alignment with the EU Statements.\n\nAnnex I - Relations between the EU and Serbia\n\nAs part of the accession negotiations, 22 chapters have been opened, two of which have been provisionally closed (Chapters 25 and 26). In line with the revised enlargement methodology, which Serbia accepted, negotiation chapters are grouped in six thematic clusters, and negotiations should be opened for each cluster as a whole \u2013 after fulfilling opening benchmarks \u2013 rather than on individual chapters. All chapters of cluster 1 (fundamentals) and cluster 4 (green agenda and sustainable connectivity) have been opened. Cluster 3 (competitiveness and inclusive growth) is the most advanced after those and in line to be opened next. Serbia tabled its negotiating positions on Chapters 2, 3, 10, 16, 19 and 28.\n\nSerbia is participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process. Serbia continued to build a track record in implementing the obligations of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA). However, Serbian legislation still does not comply with the SAA in a number of areas, including on restrictions on the acquisition of real estate and on discriminatory practices in issuing payment cards by banks. On public procurement, intergovernmental agreements concluded with third countries and their implementation do not follow the EU principles of equal treatment, transparency, non-discrimination and competition for the majority of the value of public procurement contracts. As a result, EU companies are prevented from participating in large-scale infrastructure projects in the country.\n\nRegular political and economic dialogue between the EU and Serbia has continued. Subcommittee meetings were held, together with a meeting of a special group on public administration reform. Serbia also participates in the ministerial dialogue between the economic and finance ministers of the EU and candidate countries, where joint recommendations are adopted. The most recent meeting was held on 13 May 2025.\n\nEconomic integration with the EU is strong. The EU is Serbia\u2019s main trading partner. In 2024, the EU accounted for 58.3% of Serbia\u2019s total trade. Serbia\u2019s trade deficit with the EU slightly increased to EUR 5.2 billion in 2024, against EUR 5.1 billion in 2023. In comparison, Serbia\u2019s trade with its second largest trading partner, CEFTA, accounted for around 9% of total trade. Serbia\u2019s total trade in 2024 increased further to EUR 68.2 billion.\n\nSerbia\u2019s pattern of alignment with EU common foreign and security policy positions remained largely unchanged. Serbia continued to participate actively in EU crisis management missions and operations under the common security and defence policy.\n\nThe Balkans Medical Task Force, in which Serbia participates, benefits from a EUR 6 million 2022 support measure under the European Peace Facility.\n\nVisa-free travel for citizens of Serbia travelling to the Schengen area has been in force since December 2009. A readmission agreement between the EU and Serbia has been in force since 2008. The Commission\u2019s December 2024 seventh report under the visa suspension mechanism concluded that Serbia continues to meet the visa liberalisation requirements.\n\nUnder the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance 2021 \u2013 2027 (IPA III)[6](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025SC0755#footnote7) a financing decision for IPA 2025-27 was adopted amounting to EUR 139.4 million in support for Serbia covering areas of fundamental reforms, good governance, local development, and acquis alignment. This complements EUR 875 million in IPA III support provided under financing decisions adopted in 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. This comprises two operational programmes on (i) environment and energy, as well as on (ii) employment, skills, and social inclusion, amounting to total EUR 340 million in EU support. Furthermore, EUR 288 million in EU support are provided for the rural development programme, IPARD III.\n\nThis set of programmes are complemented by a significant package of multi-country and regional programmes, including the Western Balkans Investment Framework. Additionally, Serbia participates in three cross-border cooperation programmes with neighbouring Western Balkan countries and in transnational cooperation programmes with Member States under the European Regional Development Fund and the IPA Adriatic cross\u2011border programme. The new activities add to ongoing programmes under IPA II(2014-2020), which are still providing significant support to the social and economic development of the country and contributing to key reforms in the rule of law, public administration reform and other sectors.\n\nUnder the Reform and Growth Facility, Serbia could benefit from an indicative allocation of EUR 1.586 billion, to be channelled via a Reform Agenda covering key reforms in four policy areas: business environment and private-sector development; green and digital transition; private-sector development and business environment; human capital development; and fundamentals / rule of law. Disbursement of EU support will be conditional on compliance with the preconditions \u2013 including, for Serbia and Kosovo, constructive engagement in the normalisation of their relations with a view to fully implementing all their respective obligations stemming from the Agreement on the Path to Normalisation and its Implementation Annex and all past Dialogue Agreements and engage in negotiations on the Comprehensive Agreement on normalisation of relations.\n\nSerbia participates with IPA support in the following EU programmes: Horizon Europe, the Competitiveness of Enterprises and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises programme, the European Cooperation in Science and Technology, Connecting Europe Facility, Erasmus+ and Creative Europe, the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values programme, Employment and Social Innovation, EUREKA and the Digital Europe programme. To improve green budgeting practices, Serbia is participating, as observer, in two pilot projects under the Technical Support Instrument. Serbia also participates in the European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIH) network, the EU digital agenda for the Western Balkans the EU4Digital initiative and Wifi4WB.\n\nAnnex II \u2013 Statistical

It lists all the committees each of Commission departments are responsible for, in order to provide transparency with regard to policy sector activities. The comments below the tables highlight important changes (e.g. the creation, transfer or abolition of committees or procedures), together with cases referred to the appeal committee and, for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, cases referred to the Council (in cases where the committee issued a negative opinion or no opinion) or in which the European Parliament or the Council opposed the adoption of a measure during the year in question.\n\nDetails of each committee, such as basic legal acts and applicable comitology procedure(s), are available in the Comitology Register:\n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regcomitology/index_en.htm\n\nExplanatory remarks\n\nThe following explanations are intended to help the reader better understand the work of comitology committees and the statistical data presented.\n\nOpinions delivered by the committees may concern various types of draft Commission acts (directives, regulations, decisions).\n\nThe impact of the committee\u2019s opinion varies, depending on the procedure.\n\nUnder the examination\u00a0procedure, following a positive opinion the Commission adopts the implementing act. Following a negative opinion, the Commission cannot adopt the implementing act. In case the committee delivers a no opinion\u00a0(i.e. after the committee has taken a vote, there is no qualified majority either in favour or against the draft act), the Commission may adopt the implementing act, except in the following three cases where a\nno opinion has a blocking effect according to Art. 5 (4), 2nd subparagraph of Regulation 182/2011 (the Comitology Regulation):\n\n\u00b7\nwhere the draft implementing act concerns certain areas referred to in Art. 5 (4), 2nd subparagraph point a);\n\n\u00b7\nwhere the basic legal act provides that the draft implementing act may not be adopted where no opinion is delivered;\n\n\u00b7\nor where a simple majority of the members of the committee opposes the draft.\n\nIn cases of a negative opinion or \u2018no opinion\u2019 with a blocking effect, if the Commission deems the act necessary, it can continue the procedure, either by amending the draft implementing act and submitting the revised version to the (same) committee or by referring the original draft to the appeal committee. In the latter case, if the appeal committee delivers a positive opinion, the Commission adopts the implementing act and it may also adopt the implementing act if the appeal committee gives no opinion. If the appeal committee delivers a negative opinion, the Commission cannot adopt the implementing act.\n\nUnder the advisory procedure, the committee\u2019s opinion is not legally binding, but the Commission must take utmost account of the conclusions drawn from the discussions within the committee and of the opinion delivered before deciding on the draft implementing act.\n\nUnder the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, following a positive opinion, the Commission adopts the measure. If a negative opinion or no opinion is given, the Commission submits a proposal on the measure to the Council, which then has the power to decide (see Cases referred to the Council). In addition, the European Parliament and the Council can oppose the adoption of a draft measure, even if the committee has given a positive opinion.\n\nThe total number of positive opinions delivered by committees may differ from the number of implementing acts/measures adopted by the Commission in a given sector, if opinions are delivered one year but the instruments are not adopted until the following year.\n\nAs regards the list of committees, all those are listed that had a valid legal basis in 2024, during the entire year or part of it. In certain cases, the committee was abolished at some point of the year as the basic act establishing it was repealed; these cases are flagged as \u2018abolished\u2019 in the remarks following the summary tables.\n\nThe committees are listed per Commission service (Directorate-General/DG). To note that in certain cases, the committees are managed jointly by different DGs. Some committees therefore work on implementing acts that fall under the responsibility of various DGs and as a result, acts prepared in the same committee are eventually adopted by different DGs.\n\nA number of committees had no activity at all in the reporting year. This is indicated by the figure \u20180\u2019 in all columns.\n\nIn a limited number of cases, the changes made in the Comitology Register in 2024 (i.e. new committees set up or old ones abolished) reflected a change in the legal situation that had already occurred prior to 2024. Consequently, some committees were added 1 \u00a0to or removed 2 from the tables below \u2013 compared to last year\u2019s report \u2013\u00a0without being identified for 2024 as \u2018newly created\u2019 or \u2018abolished\u2019, since the report takes the legal and not the technical changes as reference point.\n\n* * *\n\nAgriculture and Rural Development

COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank[(1)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52024AP0357#ntr1-C_202503783EN.000201-E0002),\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[(2)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52024AP0357#ntr2-C_202503783EN.000201-E0003),\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure[(3)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52024AP0357#ntr3-C_202503783EN.000201-E0004),\n\nWhereas:\n\n(1)Reporting requirements play a key role in ensuring proper monitoring and correct enforcement of legislation. However, it is important to streamline those requirements in order to ensure that they fulfil the purpose for which they were intended and to limit the administrative burden.\n\n(2)Under Regulation (EU)2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council[(4)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52024AP0357#ntr4-C_202503783EN.000201-E0005), all administrators of benchmarks, regardless of the systemic relevance of those benchmarks or of the amount of financial instruments or contracts that use those benchmarks as reference rates or as performance benchmarks, are to comply with several very detailed requirements, including requirements on their organisation, on the governance and conflicts of interest, on oversight functions, on input data, on codes of conduct, on reporting of infringements, and on methodological and benchmark statement disclosures. Those very detailed requirements have put a disproportionate regulatory burden on administrators of smaller benchmarks in the Union considering the aims of Regulation (EU)2016/1011, that is to safeguard financial stability and to avoid negative economic consequences that result from the unreliability of benchmarks. It is therefore necessary to reduce that regulatory burden by focusing on those benchmarks with the greatest economic relevance for the Union market, i.e. significant and critical benchmarks, and on those benchmarks that contribute to the promotion of key Union policies, i.e. EU Climate Transition and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks. For that reason, the scope of application of Titles II, III, IV and VI of Regulation (EU)2016/1011 should be reduced to those specific benchmarks.\n\n(2a)Benchmark administrators who wish to remain within the scope of Regulation (EU)2016/1011 should have the option to request voluntary supervision even if their benchmarks do not meet the threshold of a significant benchmark or they are not designated as significant. Likewise, benchmark administrators whose benchmarks do not meet the threshold of a significant benchmark and who wish to obtain a regulatory licence under Regulation (EU)2016/1011 should not be prohibited from doing so.\n\n(3)Under Article 18a of Regulation (EU)2016/1011, the Commission can exempt certain spot foreign exchange benchmarks from the scope of that Regulation to ensure their continued availability for use in the Union. In view of the need for a revised and narrower focus of Regulation (EU)2016/1011 on critical benchmarks, significant benchmarks, EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-Aligned Benchmarks, there is no longer a need for the specific exemption regime for spot foreign exchange benchmarks.\n\n(4)Pursuant to Article 19d of Regulation (EU)2016/1011, administrators of significant benchmarks are required to endeavour to provide an EU Climate Transition Benchmark or an EU Paris-aligned Benchmark to establish minimum standards for climate benchmarks and to provide a comprehensive supply of climate indices in the Union.\n\n(5)The criteria for assessing whether a benchmark is a significant benchmark are currently laid down in Article 24 of Regulation (EU)2016/1011. Benchmarks will be considered to be significant, inter alia where they meet the threshold laid down in Article 24(1), point (a), of that Regulation.\n\n(6)Benchmark administrators should monitor the use in the Union of the benchmarks they provide and notify the competent authority concerned or the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), depending on where that administrator is located, that the aggregate use of one of their benchmarks has exceeded the threshold laid down in Article 24(1), point (a), of Regulation (EU)2016/1011. However, it is challenging to calculate such a threshold, especially at Union level. To ensure the consistent implementation of that threshold ESMA should develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify further the calculation method. Furthermore, administrators of benchmarks used in the Union should endeavour to obtain a globally agreed identifier code to identify their benchmarks.\n\n(6a)To ensure that benchmark administrators have sufficient time to adapt to the requirements that apply to significant benchmarks, they should only be subject to those requirements as from 60 working days from the day they submitted such a notification. In addition, benchmark administrators should provide the competent authorities concerned or ESMA, upon request, with all information necessary to assess that benchmark\u2019s aggregate use in the Union.\n\n(6b)Where a benchmark administrator omits or refuses to notify the competent authorities that the use of one of its benchmarks has exceeded the threshold laid down in Article 24(1), point (a), of Regulation (EU)2016/1011, and where the competent authorities have clear and demonstrable grounds to consider that the threshold has been exceeded, the competent authorities concerned or ESMA, as appropriate, should be able to declare that the threshold has been exceeded, having first given the administrator the opportunity to be heard. Such declaration should trigger the same obligations for the benchmark administrator as a notification by the benchmark administrator. This should be without prejudice to the ability of competent authorities or ESMA to impose administrative sanctions on administrators that fail to notify that one of their benchmarks has exceeded the applicable threshold.\n\n(7)Markets, prices and the regulatory environment evolve over time. To take those evolutions into account, the Commission should be empowered to further specify the methodology to be used by administrators and competent authorities to calculate the total value of financial instruments, financial contracts or investment funds referencing a benchmark.\n\n(8)However, in exceptional cases, there may be benchmarks with an aggregate use below the threshold laid down in Article 24(1), point (a), of Regulation (EU)2016/1011 which, due to the specific situation in the market of a Member State, are nevertheless of such importance to that Member State that any lack of reliability would be of comparable impact as that of a benchmark the usage of which exceeds that threshold. For that reason, the competent authority of that Member State should be able to designate such a benchmark, where that benchmark is provided by an EU administrator, as significant on the basis of a set of qualitative criteria. For benchmarks provided by a non-EU administrator, it should be ESMA that, on the request of one or more competent authorities, designates such a benchmark as a significant benchmark.\n\n(9)To ensure the consistency and coordination of national designations of benchmarks as significant benchmarks, competent authorities intending to designate a benchmark as significant should consult ESMA. For the same reason, a competent authority of a Member State that intends to designate as significant a benchmark that is provided by an administrator that is located in another Member State should also consult the competent authority of that other Member State. Where competent authorities disagree which among them should designate and supervise a benchmark, ESMA should settle that disagreement in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council[(5)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52024AP0357#ntr5-C_202503783EN.000201-E0006).\n\n(10)To respect the right to be heard, a competent authority or ESMA should, before designating a benchmark as significant, allow the administrator of that benchmark to provide any useful information relevant to its designation.\n\n(11)For the designation as a significant benchmark to be as transparent as possible, competent authorities or ESMA should issue a designation decision containing the reasons why that benchmark is considered significant. Competent authorities should publish the designation decision on their website and should notify that decision to ESMA. For the same reasons, where ESMA designates a benchmark as significant upon a request of a competent authority, ESMA should publish the designation decision on its website and should notify the requesting competent authority thereof.\n\n(12)EU Climate Transition Benchmarks (EU-CTB) and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks (EU-PAB) are specific categories of benchmarks, defined by their compliance with rules governing their methodology and the disclosure requirements of their administrators\u258c. For that reason, and to prevent claims that could lead users to think that such benchmarks are compliant with the standards attached to those labels, it is necessary to subject those benchmarks to mandatory registration, authorisation, recognition or endorsement, as appropriate, and to supervision.\n\n(12a)The regulatory treatment of commodity benchmarks should be tailored to their specific characteristics. Commodity benchmarks that are subject to the general rules for financial benchmarks should be treated identically to other financial benchmarks and should be covered by Regulation (EU)2016/1011 only if they are significant or critical benchmarks and have not been exempted from the scope of this Regulation. Commodity benchmarks subject to the specific regime in Annex II of Regulation (EU)2016/1011 should always be covered by that Regulation in order to ensure the robustness and reliability of their assessments.\n\n(13)To ensure the timely start of the supervision of significant benchmarks, administrators of benchmarks that have become significant either by reaching the applicable quantitative threshold or by designation, should be required to seek, within 60 working days, authorisation or registration or, in the case of benchmarks provided by an administrator located in a third-country, endorsement or recognition.\n\n(14)To mitigate the risks linked to the use of benchmarks that are potentially not safe for use in the Union, and to warn potential users, competent authorities and ESMA should be able to issue a warning under the form of a public notice that the administrator of a significant benchmark does not comply with the applicable requirements, in particular as regards the compliance with the obligation for the benchmark administrator to be authorised, registered, endorsed or recognised, as applicable. Once such a warning has been issued, supervised entities should no longer be able to add new references to such benchmarks or combination of benchmarks. Similarly, to prevent the risks entailed by the use of benchmarks that claim compliance with the EU Climate Transition and EU Paris-aligned labels without being subject to adequate supervision, supervised entities should neither be able to add new references to an EU Climate Transition Benchmark or an EU Paris-aligned Benchmark or combination of such benchmarks in the Union where the administrator of those benchmarks is not included in ESMA\u2019s register of administrators and benchmarks.\n\n(15)To avoid potentially excessive market disruptions following the prohibition of the use of a benchmark, competent authorities or ESMA should be able to allow the temporary continued use of such a benchmark. To ensure a sufficient level of transparency and protection vis-\u00e0-vis end-investors, users of those benchmarks that are subject to a warning under the form of a public notice should identify a suitable alternative to replace those benchmarks within 6 months following the publication of that public notice, or otherwise ensure that clients are appropriately informed of the lack of an alternative benchmark.\n\n(16)Under Article 32 of Regulation (EU)2016/1011, recognition of benchmark administrators located in a third country serves as a temporary means of access to the Union market pending the adoption of an equivalence decision by the Commission. However, given the very limited number of third-country benchmarks covered by equivalence decisions, such recognition should become a permanent means of access to the Union market for such benchmark administrators.\n\n(17)Benchmarks covered by an equivalence decision are considered to be equivalently regulated and supervised to Union benchmarks. The obligation to seek endorsement or recognition should therefore not apply to administrators of significant benchmarks located in a third country that benefit from an equivalence decision.\n\n(18)In the interest of transparency and to ensure legal certainty, competent authorities that designate a benchmark as significant should specify the potential use restrictions that arise where the administrator of such a benchmark fails to be authorised or registered or fails to comply with the endorsement or recognition requirements, as applicable.\n\n(19)To mitigate the risks linked to the use of inadequately supervised significant benchmarks, where the administrator of a benchmark that becomes significant does not seek authorisation, registration, recognition or endorsement within the prescribed time limit, or where the authorisation, registration, recognition or endorsement for such benchmark administrator fails, or where an administrator is withdrawn its authorisation, registration, endorsement or recognition, the competent authority or ESMA, as applicable, should issue a public notice stating that the significant benchmarks provided by that administrator are not suitable for use in the Union.\n\n(20)Benchmark users rely on transparency regarding the regulatory status of benchmarks they use or intend to use. For that reason, ESMA should list in the register of administrators and benchmarks those benchmarks that are subject to the most detailed requirements laid down in Regulation (EU)2016/1011, either because their use in the Union is above the set threshold for significant benchmarks, because they are designated as significant by a national supervisor or by ESMA, or because they are critical benchmarks. For the same reason, ESMA should also list in that register EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks provided by administrators that are authorised or registered. Finally, ESMA should also list in the register the benchmarks for which a competent authority or ESMA has issued a public notice prohibiting the further use of that benchmark. To further reduce the burden on users, all such information should also be made readily available on the European Single Access Point (ESAP).\n\n(20a)Two categories of ESG-related benchmarks are subject to compliance with minimum standards set out by Union law, namely EU Climate Transition Benchmarks (EU-CTB) and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks (EU-PAB). Regulation (EU)2019/2089 has introduced rules as regards the transparency of benchmarks claiming, in their legal or marketing documentation, to be taking environmental, social or governance (ESG) factors into consideration in their design. In order to maintain a high level of transparency surrounding ESG-related claims and an adequate level of protection for users, it is appropriate to require users not to use benchmarks making ESG-related claims where such benchmarks do not provided users with the information referred to in Articles 13(1), point (d), and 27(2a) of Regulation (EU)2016/1011. This should apply to the use of any benchmark claiming to take ESG factors into account in their design, regardless of whether such benchmarks are administered in the Union or in a third-country.\n\nHowever, other categories of benchmarks making ESG-related claims, not considered EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks, could contribute, or alternatively pose risks, to the promotion of key Union policies on sustainable finance and the achievement of related objectives or the implementation of the European Green Deal.\n\nTherefore, it is appropriate that by 31 December 2028 the Commission presents a report, on the basis of input from ESMA, assessing the availability of ESG benchmarks in European and global markets and their market up-take, analysing whether they would be considered significant benchmarks, and studying the costs and effects on market availability and the evolving nature of the sustainable indicators and the methods used to measure them. Furthermore, it should assess the need to regulate benchmarks making ESG-related claims, with the aim to maintain an adequate level of protection of users of those benchmarks as well as a high level of transparency, reduce the risk of greenwashing and ensure coherence with other EU legislation on sustainable disclosure requirements. That report should be accompanied by an impact assessment and, where appropriate, a legislative proposal.\n\n(21)To ensure a seamless transition to the application of the rules introduced under this Regulation administrators previously supervised under Regulation (EU)2019/2089 should keep existing registrations, authorisations, recognitions or endorsements for nine months after the entry into application of this amending Regulation. That period is intended to give competent authorities and ESMA sufficient time to decide whether any of the previously supervised administrators should be designated in accordance with this amending Regulation. If designated, administrators previously authorised, registered, endorsed or recognised or administrators who voluntarily opt-in to this Regulation, should be allowed to retain their previous status without the need to re-apply. Administrators of significant benchmarks should, in any case, be allowed to retain their status as authorised, registered, endorsed or recognised benchmark administrators.\n\n(22)In order to give competent authorities and ESMA the necessary time to gather information on potential significant benchmarks and to adapt existing infrastructure to the new framework proposed under this amending Regulation, the date of application of this Regulation should be deferred.\n\n(23)Regulation (EU)2016/1011 should therefore be amended accordingly,\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\nArticle 1\n\nAmendments to Regulation (EU)2016/1011\n\nRegulation (EU)2016/1011 is amended as follows:\n\n(1)Article 2 is amended as follows: (a)the following paragraph is inserted: \u20181a.Titles II, III, with the exception of Articles 23a to 23c, IV and VI.apply only in respect of critical benchmarks, significant benchmarks, EU Climate Transition, Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks. Article 10 in Title II and Titles III, IV and VI apply to commodity benchmarks subject to Annex II\u2019 ; (b)in paragraph 2, point (g) (i) is deleted;\n\n(2)in Article 3, paragraph 1 is amended as follows: (-a)in point (17), point (m) is replaced by the following: \u2018(m)an administrator authorised or registered pursuant to Article 34\u2019; (a)point (22a) is deleted; (b)point (27) is deleted;\n\n(3)Article 5 is amended as follows: (a)in paragraph 5, second subparagraph, the last sentence is deleted; (b)paragraph 6 is deleted;\n\n(4)Article 11 is amended as follows: (a)in paragraph 5, first subparagraph, the last sentence is deleted; (b)paragraph 6 is deleted;\n\n(5)Article 13 is amended as follows: (a)in paragraph 3, first subparagraph, the last sentence is deleted; (b)paragraph 4 is deleted;\n\n(6)Article 16 is amended as follows: (a)in paragraph 5, second subparagraph, the last sentence is deleted; (b)paragraph 6 is deleted;\n\n(7)in Title III, the title of Chapter 2 is replaced by the following:\n\n\u2018 Interest rate benchmarks \u2019;\n\n(7a)in Article 18 (1), the second subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n\n\u2018 Article 25 shall not apply to the provision of, and contribution to, interest rate benchmarks. \u2019;\n\n(8)Article 18a is deleted;\n\n(8a)in Article 19(1), the second subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n\n\u2018 Article 25 shall not apply to the provision of, and contribution to, commodity benchmarks. \u2019;\n\n(9)in Article 19a, the following paragraphs are added: \u20184.Administrators that are not included in the ESMA register referred to in Article 36 shall not: (a)provide or endorse EU Climate Transition Benchmarks or EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks; (b)indicate or suggest, in the name of the benchmarks they make available for the use in the Union or in the legal or marketing documentation for those benchmarks, that the benchmarks they make available comply with the requirements applicable to the provision of EU Climate Transition Benchmarks or EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks.\u2019 4 a.Administrators shall include the term \u201cEU CTB\u201d in the name of the EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and the term \u201cEU PAB\u201d in the name of the EU Paris Aligned Benchmarks.;\u2019\n\n(10)Article 19d is replaced by the following:\n\n\u2018Article 19d\n\nEndeavour to provide EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks.\n\nAdministrators which are located in the Union and provide significant benchmarks determined on the basis of the value of one or more underlying assets or prices shall endeavour to provide one or more EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks.\u2019\n\n;\n\n(11)Article 24 is replaced by the following: \u2018Article 24 Significant benchmarks 1.A benchmark which is not a critical benchmark shall be significant where either of the following conditions is met: (a)the benchmark is used directly or indirectly within a combination of benchmarks within the Union as a reference for financial instruments or financial contracts or for measuring the performance of investments funds, that have a total average value of at least EUR 50 billion on the basis of the characteristics of the benchmark, including: (i)the range of maturities or tenors of the benchmark, where applicable, over a period of six months; (ii)all the currencies or other units of measurement of the benchmark, where applicable, over a period of six months; and (iii)all the return calculation methodologies, where applicable, over a period of six months; (b)the benchmark has been designated as significant in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 or the procedure laid down in paragraph 6. 2.An administrator shall immediately notify ESMA and, if located in an EU Member State the competent authority of that Member State\u258c, where one or several of that administrator\u2019s benchmarks exceed the threshold referred to in paragraph 1, point (a). Following receipt of that notification, \u258cESMA\u258c shall publish a statement on its website stating that that benchmark is significant either in one Member State or within the Union. An administrator shall, upon request, provide ESMA and the competent authority of the Member State where it is located \u258cwith information as regards whether the threshold referred to in paragraph 1, point (a) has been effectively exceeded. Where a competent authority or\u258c ESMA has clear and demonstrable grounds to consider that a benchmark exceeds the threshold referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), the competent authority or ESMA may issue a notice stating that fact. Such a notice shall trigger the same obligations for the benchmark administrator as a notification as referred to in paragraph 2. At least 10 working days before issuing such notice, the competent authority or ESMA shall inform the administrator of the benchmark concerned of its findings, and invite that administrator to submit any observation. 3.A competent authority may, having consulted ESMA in accordance with paragraph 4 and taking into account its advice, designate a benchmark provided by an administrator located in the Union that does not meet the condition laid down in paragraph 1, point (a), as significant where that benchmark fulfils all of the following conditions: (a)the benchmark has no, or very few, appropriate market-led substitutes; (b)in the event that the benchmark ceases to be provided, or is provided on the basis of input data no longer fully representative of the underlying market or economic reality or on the basis of unreliable input data, there would be significant and adverse impacts on\u258c financial stability, consumers, the real economy, or the financing of households and businesses in its Member State or in the Union; (c)the benchmark has not been designated by a competent authority of another Member State or ESMA. Where a competent authority concludes that a benchmark fulfils the criteria set out in the first subparagraph, the competent authority shall prepare a draft decision to designate the benchmark as significant and notify that draft decision to the administrator concerned and to the competent authority of the administrator\u2019s home Member State where relevant. The competent authority concerned shall also consult ESMA on the draft decision. The administrators concerned and the competent authority of the administrator\u2019s home Member State shall have 15 working days from the date of notification of the draft decision of the designating competent authority concerned to provide observations and comments in writing. The designating competent authority concerned shall inform ESMA of the observations and comments received and shall duly consider those observations and comments before adopting a final decision. The designating competent authority shall notify ESMA of its decision, and publish the decision, including the reasons for which it was made and the consequences of this designation, on its website without undue delay.; 4.When consulted by a competent authority on the intended designation of a benchmark as significant in accordance with paragraph 3, first subparagraph, ESMA shall, within 3 months, issue an advice that takes into account the following factors, in light of the specific characteristics of the benchmark concerned: (a)whether the consulting competent authority has sufficiently substantiated its assessment that the conditions referred to in paragraph 3, first subparagraph are met; (b)whether, in the event that the benchmark ceases to be provided, or is provided on the basis of input data that are no longer fully representative of the underlying market or economic reality or that are unreliable, there would be significant and adverse impacts on\u258c financial stability, consumers, the real economy, or the financing of households and businesses in the Union or Member States other than the Member State of the consulting competent authority. For the purposes of point (b), ESMA shall take due account, where relevant, of the information provided by the consulting authority pursuant to the third subparagraph of paragraph 3. 5.Where ESMA finds that a benchmark meets the conditions under paragraph 3, first subparagraph, points (a) and (b), in the Union or in more than one Member State, it shall inform the competent authorities of the Member States concerned thereof. \u258c ESMA shall prepare a draft decision to designate the benchmark as significant within the Union and notify that draft decision to the administrator concerned and to the relevant competent authorities where point (b) applies. The administrators concerned and the relevant competent authorities shall have 15 working days from the date of notification of the draft decision of ESMA to provide observations and comments in writing. ESMA shall consider those observations and comments before adopting and publishing a final decision. 6.ESMA may, upon the request of a competent authority, or on its own initiative, designate a benchmark provided by an administrator located in a third country that does not meet the threshold laid down in paragraph 1, point (a), as significant where that benchmark fulfils all of the following conditions: (a)the benchmark has no, or very few, appropriate market-led substitutes; (b)in the event that the benchmark would cease to be provided, or would be provided on the basis of input data that are no longer fully representative of the underlying market or economic reality or that are unreliable, there would be significant and adverse impacts on\u258c financial stability, consumers, the real economy, or the financing of households and businesses in the Union or in one or more Member States. ESMA shall, prior to the designation decision and as soon as possible, inform the administrator of the benchmark of its intention, and invite that administrator to provide ESMA within 15 working days with a reasoned statement containing any relevant information for the purposes of the assessment related to the designation of the benchmark as significant. Where applicable, ESMA shall invite, as soon as possible, the competent authority of the jurisdiction where the administrator is located to provide any relevant information for the purposes of the assessment related to the designation of the benchmark. ESMA shall motivate any designation decision, taking into account whether there is sufficient evidence that the conditions referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph are met, in light of the specific characteristics of the benchmark concerned. ESMA shall publish its reasoned decision on its website and shall notify the requesting competent authority or authorities without undue delay. 6a.Administrators of benchmarks which do not meet the requirements to be considered as critical, significant, commodity benchmarks subject to Annex II, EU Climate Transition Benchmarks or EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks may voluntarily apply to access to the register provided for in Article 36 either by means of authorisation, registration, recognition or endorsement. Administrators who voluntarily opt-in to this Regulation shall do so in writing with their current supervisory authority, per benchmark and each of those benchmarks shall be deemed significant under this Regulation. The voluntary waiver of this regime shall not prevent the corresponding administrative responsibilities from being imposed in the event of non-compliance or infringement of the Regulation (EU)2016/1011 during their voluntary stay in the register provided for in Article 36. 7.ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify: (i)the calculation method, including potential data sources, to be used to determine the threshold referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), of this Article; (ii)the criteria to assess when a benchmark exceeds the threshold referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), of Article 24 in one Member State or across the Union; (iii)the information that competent authorities shall provide when consulting ESMA as required pursuant to Article 24, paragraph 3; (iv)the criteria referred to in paragraph 4, point (b), of Article 24, taking into consideration any data which helps assess the significant and adverse impact of the cessation or unreliability of the benchmark on market integrity, financial stability, consumers, the real economy, or the financing of households and businesses in one or more Member States; ESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by... [12 months from the entry into force of this Regulation]. Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010. 7a.By... [2 years after date of the date of entry into force of this amending Regulation] the Commission shall, in close cooperation with ESMA, present a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the adequacy of the threshold referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 of this Article in the light of market, price and regulatory developments. That report shall be accompanied, where appropriate, by a legislative proposal. Such review shall take place at least every three years. 7b.Where ESMA considers it approriate that the threshold referred to in paragraph 1, point (a)be reviewed earlier in the light of market, price and regulatory developments, it shall submit a request to the Commission to review the threshold. Upon receipt of that request, the Commission shall review the need to reassess the threshold and act in accordance with paragraph 7a.\u2019 ;\n\n(12)the following article is inserted: \u2018Article 24a Requirements for administrators of significant benchmarks (1)Within 60 working days following the notification referred to in Article 24(2), the administrator of a benchmark satisfying the criterion referred to in paragraph (1), point (a), of that Article, shall seek authorisation or registration with the competent authority of the Member State where it is significant in that Member State or with ESMA where the benchmark is significant within the Union. Where that administrator is located in a third country and unless the benchmark concerned is covered by an equivalence decision adopted pursuant to Article 30, that administrator shall, within 60 working days following the notification referred to in Article 24(2), apply with ESMA for either of the following: (a)recognition \u258cpursuant to the procedure set out in Article 32; (b)endorsement pursuant to the procedure set out in Article 33. (2)Within 60 working days following a designation referred to in Article 24(3), the administrator of the benchmark concerned, unless that administrator is already authorised or registered by a national competent authority, shall seek authorisation or registration with the designating competent authority in accordance with Article 34. (2a)Within 60 working days of a designation as referred to in Article 24(5), the administrator of the benchmark concerned shall seek authorisation or registration with ESMA in accordance with Article 34, unless that administrator is already authorised or registered. If that administrator is already authorised or registered in a Member State, such authorisation or registration shall be transferred to ESMA. (3)Withing 60 working days following a designation referred to in Article 24(6), the administrator of the benchmark concerned\u258c shall apply to ESMA for either of the following: (a)recognition\u258c pursuant to the procedure set out in Article 32; (b)endorsement pursuant to the procedure set out in Article 33. Third country benchmarks administrators shall select an endorsing administrator in the Union. (4)ESMA or competent authorities shall make use of the supervisory and sanction powers they are entrusted with under this Regulation to ensure that the relevant administrators comply with their obligations. (5)The competent authority or ESMA shall issue a public notice stating that a significant benchmark provided by an administrator does not comply with this Regulation and that users are to refrain from using that benchmark where any of the following conditions is met: (a)within 60 working days following the notification referred to in Article 24(2) the designation referred to in Article 24(3) or the designation referred to in Article 24(6), the administrator concerned has not initiated procedures to comply with paragraph 2 of this Article; (b)the authorisation, registration, recognition or endorsement procedures have failed; (c)ESMA has withdrawn the registration of the administrator in accordance with Article 31; (d)ESMA has withdrawn or suspended the recognition of the administrator concerned in accordance with Article 32(8); (e)the endorsement of the administrator concerned has ceased; (f)the competent authority has withdrawn or suspended the authorisation or registration of the administrator concerned. Competent authorities shall notify ESMA of all issued public notices without undue delay. ESMA shall publish all issued public notices on its website. ESMA or the competent authority shall remove the public notice without undue delay as soon as the reason for which it was issued is no longer valid.\u2019 ;\n\n(13)in Title III, Chapter 6 is deleted;\n\n(13a)Article 28, paragraph 2 is amended as follows:\n\n\u20182.Supervised entities other than an administrator as referred to in paragraph 1 that use a benchmark shall produce and maintain robust written plans setting out the actions that they would take in the event that a benchmark materially changes or ceases to be provided. Where feasible and appropriate, such plans shall designate one or several alternative benchmarks that could be referenced to substitute the benchmarks that would no longer be provided, indicating the reasons for the suitability of such alternative benchmarks. The supervised entities shall, upon request and without undue delay, provide the relevant competent authority with those plans and any updates and shall reflect them in contractual fallback provisions applicable to financial contracts, financial instruments and investment funds.\u2019\n\n;\n\n(14)Article 29 is amended as follows: (a)the title is replaced by the following: \u2018 Use of critical benchmarks, significant benchmarks, commodity benchmarks subject to Annex II, EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks \u2019; (b)paragraph 1 is replaced by the following: \u20181.A supervised entity shall not add new references to a critical benchmark, a significant benchmark or a combination of such benchmarks in the Union where that benchmark or combination of benchmarks is the object of a public notice issued by ESMA or a competent authority in accordance with Article 24a(5). A supervised entity shall not add new references to a critical benchmark, a commodity benchmark subject to Annex II, an EU Climate Transition Benchmark or an EU Paris-aligned Benchmark or combination of such benchmarks in the Union where the administrator of those benchmarks is not included in the register referred to in Article 36. Supervised entities shall regularly consult the European Single Access Point (ESAP) as referred to in Article 28a, or the ESMA register as referred to in Article 36, to verify the regulatory status of the administrators of critical benchmarks, significant benchmarks, commodity benchmarks subject to Annex II, EU Climate Transition Benchmarks or EU Paris-Aligned Benchmarks they intend to use. By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, ESMA or the competent authority, as appropriate, may allow the use of a benchmark subject to a public notice issued in accordance with Article 24a(5) for a period of 6 months following the publication of the public notice, renewable once, where necessary to avoid serious market disruption, or for a period of 24 months, non-renewable, for the following: (a)market making in support of client activity related to transactions executed the effective date of the prohibition; (b)transactions or other activities that reduce or hedge the supervised entity's or any client of the supervised entity's exposure to the prohibited benchmark; (c)novations of transactions; (d)transactions executed for the purposes of participation in a central counterparty auction procedure in the case of a member default, including transactions to hedge the resulting exposure; (e)interpolation or other use provided for in contractual fallback arrangements in connection with the prohibited benchmark.\u2019 ; (c)\u258cnew paragraphs 1 b, 1ba, 1bb and 1bc are inserted: \u20181 b.A supervised entity that uses a benchmark in existing financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds or financial instruments that is subject to a public notice under Article 24a(5) shall replace that benchmark with an appropriate alternative within 6 months following the publication of that notice, or issue and publish a statement on its website providing clients with a reasoned explanation for not being able to do so.\u2019 1ba.A supervised entity may use a benchmark claiming, in its legal or marketing documentation, or denomination, to take ESG factors into account in its methodology, only where its administrator discloses the information referred to in Article 13(1), point d, and in Article 27(2a). All methodology disclosure requirements shall seek coherence with Article 10 of Regulation EU 2019/2088. This paragraph shall apply to both EU and non-EU benchmarks.\u2019 (ca)Paragraph 2 is amended as follows: \u20182.Where the object of a prospectus to be published under Directive 2003/71/EC or Directive 2009/65/EC is transferable securities or other investment products that reference a critical benchmark, a significant benchmark, a commodity benchmark subject to Annex II, an EU Climate Transition Benchmark, or an EU Paris-aligned Benchmark, the issuer, offeror, or person asking for admission to trade on a regulated market shall ensure that when a public notice on the benchmark used is included in the register referred to in Article 36 of this Regulation, within 9 months following the publication of the public notice, the prospectus also includes this information in a clear and prominent manner.\u2019 (cb)a new paragraph 2a is inserted: \u20182a.Administrators of benchmarks used in the EU shall endeavour to request a globally agreed identifier code for each of the benchmarks they provide for use in the Union.\u2019 ;\n\n(15)Article 32 is amended as follows: (a)paragraph 1 is deleted; (b)paragraphs 2 and 3 are replaced by the following: \u20182.An administrator located in a third country that intends to obtain recognition as referred to in Article 24a(1) and(3) shall comply with this Regulation, with the exception of Article 11(4) and Articles 16, 20, 21 and 23. The administrator located in a third country may fulfil that condition by applying the IOSCO principles for financial benchmarks or the IOSCO principles for PRAs, as applicable, provided that such application is equivalent to compliance with this Regulation, with the exception of Article 11(4), and Articles 16, 20, 21 and 23. When determining whether the condition referred to in the first subparagraph is fulfilled and assessing the compliance with the IOSCO principles for financial benchmarks or the IOSCO principles for PRAs, as applicable, ESMA may take into account: (a)an assessment of the administrator located in a third country by an independent external auditor; (b)a certification provided by the competent authority of the third country where that administrator is located. Where, and to the extent that, a third country administrator is able to demonstrate that a benchmark it provides is a regulated-data benchmark or a commodity benchmark that is not based on submissions by contributors the majority of which are supervised entities, the administrator shall not be obliged to comply with the requirements which, pursuant to Article 17 and Article 19(1), are not applicable to the provision of regulated-data benchmarks and of commodity benchmarks. 3.An administrator located in a third country intending to obtain recognition shall have a legal representative. The legal representative shall be a \u258clegal person located in the Union and expressly appointed by that administrator to act on behalf of that administrator with regard to the administrator\u2019s obligations under this Regulation. The legal representative shall, together with the administrator, perform the oversight function relating to the provision of benchmarks performed by the administrator under this Regulation and\u258c be accountable to ESMA. ESMA may impose a supervisory measure in accordance with Article 48e on the legal representative and the administrator for one of the infringements listed in point (a) of Article 42(1) or in relation to any failure to cooperate or comply in an investigation or with an inspection or request covered by Section 1 of Chapter 4.\u2019 ; (c)in paragraph 5, the first subparagraph is replaced by the following: \u2018An administrator located in a third country intending to obtain recognition as referred to in paragraph 2 shall apply for recognition with ESMA. The applicant administrator shall provide all information necessary to satisfy ESMA that it has established, at the time of recognition, all the necessary arrangements to meet the requirements laid down in paragraph 2 with respect to its benchmark or benchmarks that have been designated in accordance with Article 24. Where applicable, the applicant administrator shall indicate the competent authority in the third country responsible for its supervision.

Asset backed securities are created through the process of securitisation.\n\n\n\n\nAgency risk\n\n\t\n\nRisk arising from the multiple relationships between different agents and parties involved in a securitisation structure, and related information asymmetries.\n\n\n\n\nAsset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) Securitisation\n\n\t\n\nA securitisation within an asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) programme: a programme of securitisations the securities issued by which predominantly take the form of asset-backed commercial paper with an original maturity of one year or less.\n\n\n\n\nCliff Effects\n\n\t\n\nSituation where small changes in the parameters used in the calculation of banks\u2019 capital requirements for securitisations result in large changes in the capital requirements.\n\n\n\n\nCLO\n\n\t\n\nCollateralised loan obligation. A securitisation backed by a pool of debt, usually corporate loans, often leveraged loans made to companies with lower credit rating.\n\n\n\n\nCovered Bond\n\n\t\n\nA senior bond issued by a bank that is characterised by a dual recourse: i.e. an investor has a claim not only against by the bank issuing the covered bonds, but it also has a priority claim against specifically assigned cover assets collateralising the bond.\n\n\n\n\nDefault risk (also \u201cCounterparty\u201d default risk)\n\n\t\n\nRisk of losses due to unexpected default, or deterioration in the credit standing, of the counterparties and debtors of an insurance or reinsurance company.\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Green Bond Standard (EUGB)\n\n\t\n\nVoluntary standard introduced by the EU Green Bond Standard Regulation to define green economic activities according to the Taxonomy Regulation. In order to qualify the bond\u2019s issuer needs to commit to use the proceeds from the issuance to finance, refinance or acquire assets\u00a0aligned with the EU taxonomy.\n\n\n\n\nGFC\n\n\t\n\nGlobal Financial Crisis \u2013 a severe worldwide economic downturn between mid-2007 and late 2008, triggered by the collapse of major financial institutions due to risky lending and collapse of the US housing market. The crisis spread internationally and led to a sharp decline in consumer wealth, widespread unemployment, and a collapse in economic activity. Many banks incurred large losses and required government interventions and bailouts to prevent bankruptcies and stabilise global financial systems.\n\n\n\n\nHQLA\n\n\t\n\nHigh-Quality Liquid Assets. Cash or assets that can be sold or exchanged easily and immediately into cash at little or no loss of value, to meet liquidity needs.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIG\n\n\t\n\nInvestment Grade. A rating that indicates that a bond has a relatively low risk of default. 'AAA' to 'AA' (high credit quality) and 'A' to 'BBB' (medium credit quality) are considered investment grade.\n\n\n\n\nJunior/Equity tranche\n\n\t\n\nA junior/equity tranche in a securitisation is the lowest-ranking class of securities, meaning it has the highest risk and is the last to receive payments from the underlying assets. This tranche absorbs any losses first if the cash flows from the securitised assets are insufficient. Because of the higher risk, junior/equity tranches offer the highest potential returns (yields), but they are also the most vulnerable to defaults or shortfalls in the asset performance.\n\n\n\n\nLCR\n\n\t\n\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio. A requirement setting out the amount of liquid assets that a bank must have to meet its short-term liquidity needs. The LCR standard is part of the Basel III framework. In the EU, it is implemented through the CRR and a dedicated LCR Delegated Act that was adopted in 2015.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nMarket volatility risk\n\n\t\n\nRisk of losses due to short-term fluctuations in market prices of financial instruments and other assets.\n\n\n\n\nMezzanine tranche\n\n\t\n\nA mezzanine tranche in a securitisation refers to a middle-ranking class of securities that sits between the senior tranche and the equity tranche. It carries a higher risk than the senior tranche because it is paid after the senior class, but before the equity/junior tranche. As a result, mezzanine tranches offer higher yields to compensate for the increased risk. If there are losses in the underlying assets, mezzanine tranches are more likely to be affected than senior tranches, but are protected from losses until the equity/junior tranche absorbs them.\n\n\n\n\nModel risk\n\n\t\n\nModel risk relates to uncertainty surrounding the way in which the credit risk of the underlying exposures (such as loans) is allocated across the securitisation capital structure (rather than uncertainty over the scale of that credit risk). It arises from models used, and assumptions made within those models, on the underlying pool and structural features of the securitisation, used to estimate distribution of losses across the securitisation capital structure.\n\n\n\n\nNon-neutrality\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nNon-neutrality of bank capital requirements means that holding all the securitisation tranches in a securitisation is subject to a higher capital charge than a direct holding of all the underlying assets as if not securitised.\u00a0Non-neutrality is the core defining element of the securitisation capital framework for banks.\n\n\n\n\nOriginator\n\n\t\n\nAn entity which itself or through related entities, directly or indirectly, was involved in the original agreement which created the obligations or potential obligations of the debtor or potential debtor giving rise to the exposures being securitised or purchases a third party\u2019s exposures on its own account and then securitises them.\n\n\n\n\n(P) factor\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nIs the main parameter responsible for the non-neutrality of the bank capital requirements for securitisation, aiming to capture principally agency and model risks embedded in securitisation. It is one of the main parameters used in the formulas for the calculation of banks\u2019 capital requirements for securitisation. The (p) factor of 1 means 100% capital surcharge compared to the capital prior to securitisation.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nRMBS\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nResidential mortgage-backed securities. Common type of traditional securitisation with residential mortgages used as underlying exposures.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nRTS\n\n\t\n\nRegulatory technical standards. Level 2 measures adopted by Commission based on drafts from ESAs. Used to modify/supplement non-essential (technical) elements of law. After adoption by the College, the Council and the EP have right of objection for 3 months, extendible by another 3 months (reduced to 1 month +1 month, if the adopted RTS is the same as the draft submitted by the ESA).\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSecuritisation repository\n\n\t\n\nA legal person that centrally collects and maintains the records of securitisations.\n\n\n\n\nSenior tranche\n\n\t\n\nA senior tranche in a securitisation refers to the highest-ranking class of securities in the structure, which has priority in receiving payments from the underlying assets. It typically carries the lowest risk and therefore offers lower yields compared to subordinate (or junior) tranches, which are paid after the senior tranche, but take on more risk.\n\n\n\n\nSME ABS\n\n\t\n\nSME Asset-Backed Securities. Common type of traditional securitisation with exposures (loans) to small and medium enterprises used as underlying exposures.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSponsor\n\n\t\n\nA credit institution or an investment firm (other than an originator), that establishes and manages an ABCP programme (or other securitisation) that purchases exposures from third-party entities or establishes an ABCP programme (or other securitisation) that purchases exposures from third-party entities and delegates the day-to-day active portfolio management involved in that securitisation to an entity authorised to perform such activity.\n\n\n\n\nSpread risk\n\n\t\n\nRisk of financial losses arising from the sensitivity of the values of assets, liabilities and financial instruments to changes in the level or in the volatility of credit spreads.\n\n\n\n\nSRT\n\n\t\n\nSignificant Risk Transfer. Process by which a bank transfers, through securitisation, a significant \u2018amount\u2019 of credit risk associated with the pool of underlying exposures from the bank\u2019s balance sheet to a third party. It is a crucial regulatory and supervisory concept in the banks\u2019 securitisations. It is a precondition for capital relief for the originator bank, and it is therefore a strategic objective of the banks seeking to enhance their capital efficiency and risk management.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSSPE or SPV\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nSecuritisation Special Purpose Entity or Special Purpose Vehicle. A \"bankruptcy-remote entity\", usually a subsidiary company, with an asset/liability structure and legal status that makes its obligations secure, even if the parent company goes bankrupt.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSTS Securitisations\n\n\t\n\nSimple, Transparent and Standardised securitisations. EU standard identifying criteria for simplicity, standardisation and transparency to differentiate STS securitisation products from more opaque and complex ones. STS securitisations benefit from a better regulatory treatment than non-STS ones. EU STS framework is an equivalent of the STC framework (framework for simple, transparent and comparable securitisations) under the Basel framework\n\n\n\n\nTPV\n\n\t\n\nThird-Party Verifier is an entity authorised to provide verifications for originators or sponsors of the STS status of their transactions, in line with Article 27 SECR.\n\n\n\n\nTranche/Tranching\n\n\t\n\nA contractually established segment of the credit risk associated with an exposure or a pool of exposures, where a position in the segment entails a risk of credit loss greater than or smaller than a position of the same amount in another segment, without taking account of credit protection provided by third parties directly to the holders of positions in the segment or in other segments. The process of creating tranches when structuring a securitisation transaction is called tranching.\n\n\n\n\nUCITS\n\n\t\n\nUndertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities. Established a regulatory framework that creates a harmonised regime for the management and sale of mutual funds. UCITS funds are designed primarily for retail investors with harmonised regulatory and investor protection requirements. UCITS have become a globally recognised brand with many non-EU jurisdictions allowing funds to be sold in their domestic market.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Abbreviations\n\nAFME\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nAssociation for Financial Markets in Europe\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAIFMD\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nAlternative Investment Fund Managers Directive\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nBCBS\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nCoRep\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nCommon reporting framework\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nCRR\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nCapital Requirements Regulation\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDA\n\n\t\n\nDelegated Act\n\n\n\n\nDR\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nDelegated Regulation\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nEBA\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nEuropean Banking Authority\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nECB\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nEuropean Central Bank\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nEIOPA\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nEuropean Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nESA\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nEuropean Supervisory Authority\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nESMA\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nEuropean Securities and Markets Authority\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nEUGBS\n\n\t\n\nEuropean Green Bond Standard Regulation\n\n\n\n\nGDP\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nGross domestic product\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGFC\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nGlobal Financial Crisis\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIACPM\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nInternational Association of Credit Portfolio Managers\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIG\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nInvestment grade\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNCA\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nNational Competent Authority\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNCB\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nNational Central Bank\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNPL\n\n\t\n\nNon-performing Loan\n\n\n\n\nRW\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nRisk Weights\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSECR\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nSecuritisation Regulation\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSME\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nSmall and Medium-sized Enterprise\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSSM\n\n\t\n\nSingle Supervisory Mechanism\n\n\n\n\nSII\n\n\t\n\nSolvency II Directive\n\n\n\n\nSTS\n\n\t\n\nSimple, Transparent and Standardised\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\nIntroduction\n\nSecuritisation is a financial practice that involves pooling various types of contractual debt, such as mortgages, auto loans, or credit card debt, and selling their related cash flows to third-party investors as securities. This practice\u00a0emerged prominently in the U.S. in the 1970s.\u00a0Securitisation increases the depth and liquidity of financial markets by converting the illiquid debt instruments into tradable securities that capital market investors, such asset managers, insurers or banks, can buy.\u00a0On the buy side, securitised\u00a0assets are an attractive investment opportunity for investors seeking exposure to new risks, as they enable greater diversification\u00a0and superior returns in comparison to some more established fixed income assets.\u00a0In the EU\u2019s bank-centric financial system, it allows banks to free up capital and provide more financing to individuals, households, and businesses, including SMEs 1 .\u00a0Securitisation also allows banks to transfer risks outside of the banking system, thus fostering greater risk diversification within the financial system. By increasing the amount of financing available in the real economy, well-functioning securitisation markets can also contribute to higher economic growth and facilitate funding EU strategic objectives like defence or green and digital transitions. These elements make the securitisation review an important initiative under the Savings and Investment Union (SIU).\n\nHowever, there are also risks associated with securitisation, as was seen during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) 2 . Complex\u00a0structures exposed investors to large losses. Similarly, misaligned incentives between issuers and investors\u00a0incentivised issuers to securitise \u2018bad loans\u2019 3 . At the same time, securitisation amplified\u00a0asset\u00a0price\u00a0bubbles\u00a0by increasing credit growth and the risk appetite of investors, which increased risks to financial stability. Moreover, securitisation increased risks within the financial system by increasing leverage (i.e. securitisation allows to increase lending within the financial system while holding less capital) and interconnectedness between financial market entities.\n\nFor these reasons, as a response to the GFC, the EU Securitisation Framework has sought to tackle the risks associated with this instrument, in particular agency and model risks. Agency risk in the case of securitisation arises when issuers have more information than investors. Model risk occurs when imperfect economic modelling is used to value and assess the risk of securitisation. Several measures have been introduced to deal with these risks, including risk retention, transparency, due diligence, and prudential requirements. Addressing these risks effectively continues to be a key objective of the Securitisation Framework today.\n\nThe evaluation of the current framework, however, shows that the Securitisation Framework has been designed and implemented mostly in response to the shock of the GFC and as a result is too strict and hinders market development. At the time, strict requirements were considered necessary to rebuild the securitisation market which had been suffering from inadequate protections and severe investor distrust. Now that appropriate safeguards have been firmly embedded in the market\u2019s organisation and securitisation is gaining back investors\u2019 trust, a better balance between safeguards and growth opportunities- both for investments and issuance- needs to be found.\n\nThe\u00a0European public securitisation market, including CLOs, stood at approximately EUR 1.2 trillion in terms of outstanding volumes at the end of 2023 (compared to EUR 2 trillion at its peak during the GFC 4 ).\u00a0Despite showing signs of gradual recovery (the EU public\u00a0market was only EUR 790\u00a0billion in the second half of 2020 compared to EUR 900 billion by the end of 2023), securitisation issuance as a percentage of GDP remains much lower in the EU than in other major jurisdictions (according to AFME, 10-year average issuance is approximately 3% of GDP for the US and around 0.5% for the EU). A significant portion of the traditional securitisation transactions (see Section 1.1 right below for further details on the different types of securitisation) remains retained on banks' balance sheets (slightly over 40%)\u00a0to be used as collateral for obtaining liquidity from the ECB, rather than being placed on the market with external investors. At the same time, the current investor base (i.e. the number of active investors participating in the market) remains small 5 , resulting in a limited capacity to absorb increased supply. In addition, the EU securitisation market remains highly concentrated in five Member States (France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands and Spain). This can lead to uneven development of capital markets within Member States and limit the tool's potential for risk diversification. Furthermore, banks often prefer to issue covered bonds to obtain funding since they are subject to less strict regulatory requirements.\n\nSection 3.2 of Annex V (Evaluation) provides a more detailed assessment of the market context and market developments of the different parts of the securitisation market as well as the development in different countries.\n\n1.1. What is securitisation?\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two main types of securitisations: traditional (also known as \u201ccash\u201d or \u201ctrue sale\u201d), and synthetic (for an overview of the different parts of the EU securitisation market, see the market context in Annex V).\n\nTraditional securitisation (outstanding public 6 and bank originated, sponsored or invested private 7 volumes within the EU securitisation market stood at more than EUR 1,1 trillion\u00a0as of end 2023) is used primarily to obtain funding and to transfer risk out of the balance sheet of the lender. An example of a traditional securitisation is a bank selling a pool of mortgages to a securitisation special purpose entity (SSPE). As a result, the credit risk associated with the mortgages is transferred, and the mortgages are \u2018erased\u2019 from the balance sheet of the originator bank. If a bank transfers a sufficient amount of the risk to investors, it is allowed to reduce the capital it holds against the securitised assets, i.e. achieving \u2018capital relief\u2019 that is available for further lending.\u00a0The SSPE issues notes (debt instruments) divided into tranches of varying risk profiles (usually into three tranches \u2013 junior, mezzanine and senior), which are then sold to investors. The money raised through selling the notes to investors is paid by the SSPE to the bank for the purchase of the mortgage loans. This gives the bank immediate access to funds that can be used for further lending.\u00a0Common types of traditional securitisations include residential mortgage-based securitisation (RMBS), commercial-mortgages backed securitisation (CMBS), asset-backed securitisation (ABS), collateralised debt obligations (CDOs), and others.\n\nInstead of placing the notes of a traditional securitisation on the market, banks can also choose to retain part of the transaction. This allows banks to access central bank liquidity, but prevents them from achieving \u2018capital relief\u2019. These \u2018retained\u2019 traditional securitisations currently form an important part of the traditional securitisation market segment.\n\nFigure 1: Traditional Securitisation Structure\n\nA specific type of traditional securitisation is Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) securitisation. It is a short-term securitisation where the securities issued take the form of asset-backed commercial paper with a maturity of less than one year. ABCP is usually used to finance very short-term assets, such as trade receivables. ABCP is a popular form of financing for corporates because it allows them to access short-term funding at a lower cost than they would be able to obtain through traditional bank loans. The EU public and private outstanding ABCP volume by the end of 2023\u00a0is estimated\u00a0to EUR 180 million. 8\n\nSynthetic securitisation (outstanding volumes in the EU securitisation market stood\u00a0at EUR 295 billion as of end 2023 9 ) is a type of securitisation that differs from traditional securitisation. In traditional securitisation, assets are transferred off the bank's balance sheet. In contrast, synthetic securitisation does not involve the physical transfer of assets. These assets remain on the originator's balance sheet, but the risk is managed using financial instruments such as guarantees,\u00a0making it like an insurance contract.\nJust as an insurance policy compensates the policyholder\u00a0when an adverse event occurs, synthetic securitisation allows banks to be compensated when losses materialise to the underlying pool of assets. Thus, the banks\u00a0transfer the risk of default on a set of loans to investors, without selling the actual loans themselves. This allows banks to obtain \u2018capital relief\u2019 i.e. reduce the amount of capital that they need to hold for these assets, but it does not allow them to obtain funding.\u00a0The investors get remunerated for accepting the credit risk of the originating bank.\n\nFigure 2: Synthetic Securitisation Structure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Example of synthetic securitisation and regulatory capital relief\n\n Source: The European significant risk transfer securitisation market\u201d, Gonz\u00e1lez and Triandafil (2023)\n\nFigure 3 illustrates how a bank can obtain capital relief through synthetic securitisation, enabling them to lower capital requirements compared to an alternative scenario without securitisation. The underlying reference loan pool is EUR 2 billion. With a risk weight of 53% and a 8% minimum capital requirement, this bank would face a EUR 85 million minimum capital requirement for this portfolio.\n\nHowever, through a synthetic securitisation the bank may save on capital requirements by transferring the risk of the mezzanine tranche to an investor (credit risk protection provider). The portfolio is split in accordance with the capital requirements prescribed by the bank\u2019s regulatory securitisation approach. The senior tranche has only a 15% risk weight so requires only EUR 22 million of capital; the mezzanine and first loss tranches have a 0% risk weight as the risk is transferred to an external protection provider and no longer affects the bank\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nOverall, the transaction saves the bank EUR 63 million of capital in comparison to holding the portfolio on its balance sheet without risk transfer.\n\nIn the EU, securitisations can also be classified as public or private. Public securitisations (EU outstanding volumes (excluding ABCP volumes) stood at EUR 900 billion as of end of 2023 10 ) are those that must provide a prospectus to investors. Private securitisations (outstanding volumes stood at EUR 632 billion as of end 2023 11 ) are defined as securitisations where no prospectus has to be drawn up in accordance with Directive 2003/71/EC. Private securitisations have to fulfil the same regulatory requirements as public securitisations, but they are not required to use a securitisation repository to disclose the information prescribed by Article 7 of the SECR. Most traditional securitisations are public, while the majority of synthetic securitisations are private.\n\nThe securitisation market is therefore not a homogeneous market but is composed of various different segments or types of securitisations. See Annex IX for a selection of case studies which elaborate how securitisation has been used for the benefit of the real economy.\n\n1.2. Legal context\n\nThe Securitisation Framework was adopted in 2017-18 and entered into application in 2019-20 12 . It aimed to revive a safe securitisation market that improves financing of the EU economy. It consists of a Securitisation Regulation (SECR) 13 as well as amendments to the pre-existing Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) 14 , Liquidity Coverage Ratio Delegated Act (LCR) 15 , Solvency II (SII) Delegated Regulation 16 .\u00a0The SECR laid down a general framework for securitisation applicable to all involved parties. It consists of detailed rules on risk retention, transparency, due diligence, the prohibition of re-securitisation, and credit-granting standards. It also introduced an additional voluntary framework for Simple, Transparent and Standardised (STS) securitisations, originally limited to traditional securitisations only.\n\nThe CRR defines the prudential framework for banks and sets out how much capital banks need to hold for their securitisation exposures, whether as originators or investors in securitisation. SII defines the prudential framework for insurers and establishes capital requirements for insurers\u2019 investments in securitisation. The LCR defines eligibility conditions for securitisation to be included in the banks\u2019 liquidity buffers. Both CRR and LCR are largely consistent with and implement the Basel III securitisation standards.\n\nIn 2021, as part of the Capital Markets Recovery Package to help the EU economy to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, limited amendments to the SECR and to the CRR were introduced. These amendments expanded the scope of the STS framework to synthetic securitisations and removed certain regulatory impediments to the securitisation of non-performing exposures.\n\nFurthermore in 2024, a dedicated regime for green securitisations was introduced as part of the European Green Bond Standard Regulation (EUGBS) 17 .\u00a0The EUGBS introduces a voluntary standard for securitisation bonds to be labelled as green.\u00a0In order to qualify, assets in the securitisation pool have to fulfil certain requirements and originators must allocate the proceeds from securitisation to economic activities compliant with the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\u00a0\n\nThe evaluation in Annex V (section 2.2) explains the intervention logic of the current framework, i.e. the problems it intended to tackle, the solutions found and their expected and observed impacts. It assesses how the Securitisation Framework has performed over the past five years and how it can be further improved.\n\n1.3. Political context\n\nIn response to the global financial and sovereign debt crises, the EU took multiple actions to create a safer financial sector for the EU single market, including a framework to revitalise the use of securitisation while preserving financial stability. In that context, the Securitisation Framework was an important initiative under the initial Capital Markets Union (CMU) Action Plan. Although reviving the securitisation market following the shock of the GFC was part of the general objective of the Securitisation Framework, the focus was more on making the market extremely safe, and fighting the stigma associated with securitisation. As a result, most measures that were introduced made the regulatory treatment of securitisation more conservative and aimed to primarily mitigate risks, rather than stimulate market development.\n\nIn light of several years of experience with the current rules and taking into account several recent high level political statements 18 \u00a0that have highlighted the need to take additional measures to remove issuance and investment barriers in the EU securitisation market, this review aims to strike a better balance between safety and market development.\u00a0Annex II provides for a detailed description of inputs received and positions\u00a0of Member States, ESAs, ECB and other stakeholders.\n\nRelaunching securitisation has also been recommended in the reports from Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi as a means of strengthening the lending capacity of European banks\u00a0for the financing needs of EU priorities including defence, creating deeper capital markets, building the Savings and Investments Union and increasing the EU\u2019s competitiveness. Finally, the need to accelerate work on all the measures developing banking and capital markets, including securitisation, was highlighted in the political guidelines of Commission President von der Leyen from July 2024, and reiterated in the mission letter to Commissioner Albuquerque. One issue, which is mentioned in the public debate, is the possibility of setting up securitisation platform(s), with various ideas being put forward on the possible characteristics and functions of such platforms (see Draghi report) 19 . Annex VI discusses the issues more in detail.\n\nIncreasing the competitiveness of the EU economy requires substantial investments for the green and digital transitions, and for funding our strategic priorities\u00a0including the\u00a0defence sector (see the Competitiveness Compass 20 for a more comprehensive list of the European Commission\u2019s strategic priorities). By allowing banks to lend more, securitisation can contribute to the financing of these large investment needs. Securitisation is an additional tool to meet the financing needs of corporates and SMEs.\u00a0Against this background, this impact assessment outlines the problems with the current framework based on the evaluation (Annex V), identifies areas for improvement, and explores reform options that could further enhance the EU's securitisation markets, ultimately contributing to a more resilient and integrated Savings and Investments Union.\n\n2.\nProblem definition\u00a0\n\n2.1 What are the problems and problem drivers?\n\nAs the evaluation (Annex V, section 4) has demonstrated, the current framework has served to make the EU securitisation market safer.\u00a0At the same time, it has resulted in high operational costs for issuers and investors, and high prudential costs 21 for banks and insurers. Ultimately, these high costs constitute a regulatory failure, which disincentivises issuance and investment in the EU securitisation market. The evaluation shows that the specific objectives set out in the 2015 Impact Assessment (see below for a summary of this assessment) remain unmet or are only partially achieved. The Securitisation Framework has not been effective in reducing/eliminating unduly high operational costs (Problem 1 below), while it has been partially effective in removing (i) regulatory disadvantages for simple and transparent securitisations, and (ii) investor stigma. In addition, the evaluation\u00a0and stakeholder feedback have identified\u00a0undue prudential barriers that disincentive banks to issue and invest (Problem 2 below) and for insurers to invest (Problem 3 below) as two new problems that need to be addressed.\n\nTable 1: Assessment of objectives from the 2015 Impact Assessment\n\nObjective\n\n\t\n\nAssessment (see Annex V, section 4 for a detailed assessment)\n\n\n\n\nReduce/eliminate unduly high operational costs for issuers and investors\n\n\t\n\nNot achieved\n\n\n\n\nRemove stigma from investors\n\n\t\n\nPartially achieved\n\n\n\n\nRemove regulatory disadvantages for simple and transparent securitisation products\n\n\t\n\nPartially achieved\n\n2.1.1. Problem Tree\n\nFigure 4 displays the problem tree, covering the three problems that were identified in the evaluation of the Securitisation Framework, as well as during the targeted consultation and in meetings with various stakeholders. They are described in the following sections, together with their problem drivers and related consequences.\n\nThe first problem groups together all issues related to the high operational costs faced by issuers and investors in the EU securitisation market. The second problem focuses on prudential factors that unduly disincentivise banks to issue or invest in securitisations. The third problem focuses on the prudential factors that act as an undue disincentive for insurers to invest in the EU securitisation market.\n\nFigure 4: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Problem tree\n\nExternal factors\n\nBeyond the regulatory framework, there are external factors that affect financial institutions' decisions to issue and invest in the EU securitisation market. These include, among others, monetary policy, credit growth, and the availability of alternative funding sources like covered bonds. Evaluating the combined impact of these external factors on the development of the EU securitisation market since the GFC is challenging due to their interdependent nature\u2014such as the interaction between monetary policy, credit growth, and the availability of alternative funding sources\u2014and the significant variation in elements like credit growth and funding alternatives across different Member States. Although some of these factors were mentioned by stakeholders, they primarily focused on the impact of the regulatory framework on the securitisation market.\n\nThe impact of accommodative monetary policy on the\u00a0EU securitisation market since the Global Financial Crisis is unclear.\u00a0On the one hand, accommodative monetary policy\u00a0(up until 2022) could have\u00a0disincentivised\u00a0banks to issue traditional securitisations as they had access to cheap funding alternatives: central bank funding, stable deposits and liquid EU covered bond markets 22 . On the other hand, the low-for-long interest rate environment could have incentivised banks to lend more, thus providing banks with more opportunities to transfer risk and increase their activity in the securitisation market 23 .\u00a0Nevertheless, the low-interest rate environment was a common factor across many other economies and therefore may not explain on its own the slower pace of market development in the EU vis-a-vis other jurisdictions like the United States or Australia\u00a0where this market has recorded much higher issuance as a percentage of GDP in the last 10 years\u00a0(see Evaluation Section on\u00a0Market Context for more details).\u00a0\n\nRegarding credit growth, it is generally expected that higher credit growth would have a positive impact on securitisation activity. This is because, all else being equal, financial institutions need to fund their increasing loan portfolios and free up their balance sheets to facilitate further lending as demand for loans rises - and securitisation can fulfil both functions. Credit growth in the EU experienced varying trends since the GFC, so its impact on the market is ambiguous.\n\nIt is normal for market conditions to affect the attractiveness of financial instruments, including securitisation. Financial institutions should be able to select the instrument that best suits their needs, based on the prevailing market conditions. The objective of this initiative is therefore to focus on eliminating any unnecessary regulatory hurdles that may be holding back the securitisation market, so that financial institutions can access this tool whenever it is needed and are not constrained by undue regulatory burden.\n\nCross border securitisation activity is also impacted by the lack of harmonisation in regulatory frameworks outside of financial services, including insolvency 24 and taxation, which can create complexity and uncertainty for market participants trying to issue or invest in securitisations that pool assets from multiple jurisdictions. This limits the possible scale of the securitisations, as they are constrained by underlying loans structured along national legal requirements (typically mortgages).\n\nChanges to the regulatory\u00a0framework\u00a0might modify incentives for issuers and investors but cannot guarantee on their own market growth.\u00a0While regulatory changes can help scale up the securitisation\u00a0market, market participants also have an essential role to play in developing standardised products that are more attractive to investors and facilitate the work for supervisors to approve securitisation issuances. For example, the ECB is currently developing a fast-track process for the supervisory assessment of the significant risk transfer in securitisation, in close dialogue with the European Banking Federation, which aims to substantially reduce the duration of the supervisory assessments\u00a0for simple transactions meeting some requirements \u2013 this initiative is which expected to further stimulate the market 25 .\n\n2.1.2. Problem 1: High operational costs for issuers and investors\n\nThe evaluation (see Annex V, section 4.1.3) highlights the existence of high operational costs arising from the application of the current Securitisation Framework for EU issuers and investors in securitisations, also in comparison to other asset classes. High operational costs\u00a0disincentivise institutional investors 26 from investing in securitisations and prevent financial institutions from using securitisation to manage their credit risk, diversify exposures and obtain new funding. Overly burdensome and detailed transparency and due diligence requirements result in high operational costs that put EU issuers and EU investors at a competitive disadvantage relative to their international counterparts who are not subject to the same requirements. This makes entering the market particularly difficult. The current framework negatively impacts also non-EU issuers\u00a0when they want to sell their securitisation to EU investors.\n\nFrom a better regulation perspective, these costs link to \u201cadministrative burdens\u201d 27 . We estimate that annual recurring operational or administrative costs currently amount to EUR 780 million for the financial market as a whole 28 .\u00a0While these operational costs, may appear moderate when compared to the total market size, they accumulate annually. Apart from the\u00a0annual recurring costs,\u00a0one-off costs linked to the implementation of the SECR requirements represent a significant barrier to entry 29 ,Administrative hurdles therefore represent a significant obstacle for issuers and investors and have had a negative impact on the overall growth of the market.\n\nThe extent of burden reduction that can be achieved by simplifying or removing certain due diligence and transparency requirements should not undermine the policy goals of those requirements. Namely, there should remain sufficiently high levels of market transparency and investor protection to ensure that the EU securitisation market remains safe and supervisors should continue to have access to high-quality data.\n\n2.1.2.1. Certain due diligence requirements are too prescriptive and disproportionate\n\nArticle 5 of the SECR outlines the due diligence requirements for EU institutional investors (see Annex V, section 4.1.3). It aims to ensure that EU investors conduct a thorough assessment of the risks associated with securitisation. Article 5 harmonises the due diligence requirements that were introduced by regulatory bodies in the aftermath of the GFC across various pieces of sectoral legislation governing banks, asset managers, etc. to address key lessons learned from the event. One critical takeaway from the crisis was the importance of a thorough risk assessment. Inadequate due diligence, in particular risk evaluation, led investors to unknowingly take on excessive risk, leaving them unprepared to absorb the significant losses that ultimately materialised. As a result, due diligence requirements aim to empower investors by ensuring that they are aware of the potential risks associated with their securitisation investments and are better equipped to manage those risks.\n\nWhile Article 5 has helped to ensure that proper due diligence is carried out prior to investing and while holding a securitisation position, the current requirements go beyond what is needed to ensure investor protection and financial stability. The evaluation has shown that the requirements are overly prescriptive, duplicative and costly.\n\nFor example, in addition to carrying out a thorough assessment of the risks prior to holding a securitisation position, EU investors are required to verify that originators have complied with Securitisation Regulation Article 6 (risk retention), Article 7 (disclosure), Article 9 (credit granting criteria), and Articles 19 to 22 and 23 to 26 (STS criteria). These verification activities are unique to securitisation and are largely duplicative since EU supervisors are also required to check that EU originators comply with these requirements.\n\nMoreover, stakeholders argue that the risk assessment required under Article 5(3) is not proportionate because it does not differentiate between different types of securitisation positions. For example, an investor in a AAA tranche has the same due diligence requirements as an investor in a first-loss tranche, even though the risk of the position is much lower for the senior tranche investor than the first-loss tranche investor.As a result, due diligence requirements constitute a significant entry barrier for new investors. Investors prefer to invest in other comparable products with less burdensome due diligence requirements (see Annex XII for a comparison of due diligence requirements for different financial instruments).\n\nIt is important to note that EU investors are subject to the same due diligence rules regardless of whether they invest in EU or non-EU securitisations, whereas non-EU investors in EU (or non-EU) securitisations are not bound by any of these requirements. As a result, due diligence requirements impact the level playing field to the detriment of EU investors when investing in securitisations vis-a-vis their non-EU peers.\n\n2.1.2.2. Transparency requirements are not adapted to the needs of investors\n\nThe introduction of Article 7 of the SECR has improved market transparency in the EU securitisation market by ensuring that all investors and supervisors have equal access to all relevant information about the securitisation transaction. However, the evaluation (see Section 4) highlights several challenges. Meeting the Article 7 transparency requirements implies a significant compliance burden on issuers, with costs exceeding those for other comparable structured finance instruments (see Annex XII). This is confirmed by the feedback provided by market participants to the recent targeted consultation. A key factor driving these excessive costs is the broad scope and prescriptive nature of the transparency rules. Despite the extensive disclosure rules, the information provided does not always align with investor needs, making compliance with the disclosure requirements both costly and inefficient. As a result, the overall cost of issuance has increased, discouraging securitisation activity in the EU market.\n\nApplying a one-size-fits-all approach is challenging given the diversity of securitisation types. In particular for private securitisations, the current disclosure framework 30 does not sufficiently account for the fact that these are typically bilateral and bespoke transactions where investors have specific information needs for their due diligence assessment. As a result, the current templates often provide information that is not useful for investors in private transactions. At the same time, the fact that investors in private transactions have specific information needs means that the prescribed templates sometimes do not meet the specific\u00a0requirements of some investors and credit rating agencies. This means that originators of private securitisations often need to disclose additional information beyond Article 7 requirements, further increasing complexity and costs. As regards public securitisations, stakeholders report that the current templates provide too much information, include elements that are of limited use to investors.\n\n2.1.3. Problem 2: Undue prudential barriers for banks to issue securitisations\n\nThe evaluation (Annex V, section 4.1) shows that existing prudential (capital and liquidity) rules act as a disincentive for banks to issue securitisations (or invest in the senior tranches of good quality securitisations). Bank capital requirements set out in the CRR are insufficiently risk sensitive and overly conservative, resulting in unduly high levels of capital requirements that banks need to comply with for their securitisation exposures. Based on ESAs estimates, the revised securitisation prudential framework has led to significant increases in banks\u2019 capital requirements for securitisation exposures (+114% for bank originators, +77% for bank sponsors and +105% for bank investors across the market, with large variations in the impact depending on the composition of the tranches held), compared to the previous regime. Senior tranches of securitisations have experienced an increase of more than 100% in capital requirements, while mezzanine tranches have experienced an even greater increase of capital requirement, with a median increase of 281%. On average, the required capital for securitisations is approximately double the capital required for the capitalisation of the underlying pool of non-securitised assets.\u00a0\n\nThese significant increases fail to accurately recognise the important risk mitigants implemented in the EU securitisation regulatory and supervisory frameworks which have significantly reduced the agency and model risks embedded in securitisation transactions, as well as the good credit performance of EU securitisations. The model and agency risks have been reduced in recent years, notably with the introduction of STS criteria, the multi-year Targeted Review of Internal Models by the SSM, the multi-year IRB Repair programme by the EBA, the introduction of the output floor in the banking package, the risk retention requirement, and the banning of re-securitisations. As regards the credit performance, default rates of EU securitisations have been significantly lower than those of US securitisations. Also, very few senior tranches of EU securitisations have ever suffered any losses. Data over a 30-year time period show that the default risk and ratings transitions of European securitisations across tranches rated AAA to BB are commensurate with default and ratings transitions data for other fixed income asset classes, such as European corporate bonds or global sovereign bonds, rated the same level, reflecting the strong credit performance of securitisations.\n\nThe evaluation therefore assesses the adequacy of the capital requirements from two dimensions. First, the risk mitigation measures that reduce the \u2018agency\u2019 and \u2018model\u2019 risks of securitisation transactions should be recognised in the requirements, where appropriate. Second, as supported by data on default rates, the structural credit performance of EU securitisations has been very good over the past 20+ years.\n\nThese two\u00a0dimensions, reinforced with examples provided in the evaluation, demonstrate that the current capital requirements for banks are disproportionate and go beyond what is necessary to ensure a proper and prudent capitalisation of the securitisations by banks. While the presence of non-neutrality of securitisation capital requirements\u00a0\u2013 as one of the main defining elements of the securitisation capital framework for banks - is justified, the magnitude of the non-neutrality seems no longer 31 .\u00a0In addition, there are significant discrepancies in the capital requirements for securitisations among banks using different approaches applicable to their calculation (in particular the standardised approaches, used by small-to-medium sized banks, are too conservative, resulting in overly conservative capital requirements in absolute terms as well as relative to capital requirements under the internal ratings-based approaches, used by large banks).\n\nThe issue of insufficient risk sensitivity limits the attractiveness of securitisation: securitisations are seen as too \u2018expensive\u2019 which limits their use as a credit risk and balance sheet management tool for banks. Consequently, the lack of risk sensitivity acts as a prudential impediment that disincentivises EU banks from engaging in the EU securitisation market. Overall, the securitisation capital requirements currently represent only 1.5% of the EU banks\u2019 total risk-weighted asset volume (EBA, as of December 2024). Also, small-to-medium sized banks are not participating in the securitisation transactions.\n\nThe fact that banks cannot easily issue (originate) securitisations in the EU is an important issue because\u00a0banks play a critical role in the financing of\u00a0the EU economy and limiting securitisation issuance ultimately limits banks\u2019 ability to lend more to the real economy. Banks are natural users of securitisation transactions for their funding, capital, and credit risk management practices. As shown in\u00a0Figure\u00a05 below, EU banks are primarily originators (i.e. issuers) and, to a smaller extent, sponsors of securitisations, whereas in other jurisdictions banks are primarily investors 32 . Therefore, barriers to banks\u2019 origination (i.e. issuance) of securitisation might have a disproportionately high impact in the EU relative to other jurisdictions. The current prudential set-up does not allow banks to maximise the potential that securitisation can provide for their funding, capital and credit management strategies, and which could be beneficial for the EU economy as a whole.\n\nFigure 5: Banks\u2019 role in securitisation (exposure measure)\n\n Source: BCBS\u00a0Dashboard\n\nAs shown in the evaluation, existing bank capital requirements fail to reflect the robust credit performance of the EU securitisation market over the last years and decades. The EU-issued securitisation market\u2019s resilience has now been tested through multiple economic and financial cycles and periods of stress, including the GFC, the euro area sovereign debt crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and during the 2023 banking turmoil. This suggests that the good credit performance of the EU-issued securitisation market is of a structural, rather than cyclical, nature.\n\nBesides the level of capital conservativeness, the evaluation has shed light on a number of additional issues related to the framework for SRT\u00a0embedded in the CRR and the liquidity treatment of securitisations embedded in the LCR, which pose\u00a0barriers for the banks\u2019 participation in the securitisation market.\u00a0The rules governing the SRT 33 \u00a0have several structural limitations which may impede a transfer of risk in some transactions. In addition, the rules\u00a0have in some instances led to excessively costly and complex supervisory processes and inconsistent supervisory assessments of individual securitisation transactions. This has constrained banks in their capacity to issue securitisation and to use it as a capital optimisation tool and risk transfer tool.\n\nIn addition, the narrowness of the eligibility rules for securitisation in the banks\u2019 liquidity buffers under the LCR has reduced demand by bank treasuries for senior tranches of publicly offered STS traditional securitisations and lowered the level of diversification in the LCR liquidity buffer. This has reduced banks\u2019 investments in these high quality securitisations and has limited banks\u2019 contribution to the securitisation market liquidity.\n\nAll in all, the existing framework reduces the attractiveness of securitisation as an effective instrument to address banks\u2019 funding needs, manage capital and balance sheets, and redistribute risks across the wider financial system. The assessment calls for greater confidence in the quality and resilience of well-regulated and supervised securitisation transactions and puts forward the reduction of undue prudential barriers for banks as originators or investors as a new objective.\n\n2.1.4. Problem 3: Undue prudential costs for insurers to invest in the EU securitisation market\n\nThe evaluation (Annex V, section 4.1.2.2., sub-section b) shows that the existing prudential rules for insurers result in high prudential costs that act as a disincentive to invest in the EU securitisation market.\n\nInsurance companies are subject to SII which regulates how much capital insurers should set aside to cater for the risks arising from their investment activities. While larger insurers generally use their own modelling of risks (\u2018internal model\u2019) which is more tailored to the specificities of their risk profile, smaller insurers use the so-called \u2018standard formula\u2019 which clearly prescribes capital requirements on investments. Insurers using an internal model are relatively free to determine how to assess market and credit risks (subject to prior supervisory approval). Market data confirms that internal model insurers invest more than twice as much in securitisation as those using the standard formula. Insurance companies which use the standard formula have no discretion when it comes to computing capital requirements. In general, standard formula capital requirements for securitisation are higher (slightly higher for senior STS securitisation, significantly higher for non-STS securitisation) than those applicable to other fixed income securities such as corporate bonds.\n\nSII capital charges for non-STS securitisation investments are generally deemed \u2018punitive\u2019 by financial stakeholders. To illustrate the problem more concretely, investing in a non-STS securitisation would likely require an insurer to fund more than half of the value of the investment with capital. The evaluation provides several pieces of evidence supporting that the prudential treatment for non-STS securitisation, which dates back from 2013, is overly conservative. For example, under SII, it is more costly to invest in the best rated senior tranches of non-STS securitisation (which would imply an amount of capital exceeding in general 50% of the investment amount) than in riskier asset classes like unlisted equities or in equities from emerging markets, and this raises issues of coherence. This finding also holds when comparing with the capital requirements that are applicable to insurers using their own internal model.\n\nIn addition, the capital charges for securitisation under SII are not sufficiently risk sensitive. The framework assigns the same capital charge for all non-STS transactions, regardless of their seniority. This means that insurers are required to hold the same amount of capital whether they invest in a risky first-loss tranche or whether they invest in the most senior protected tranche in a non-STS transaction. All else equal, this lack of risk sensitivity incentivises insurers to invest in the most complex and most junior assets to obtain a higher return since the prudential cost of such investments would be the same as the one applicable to more senior and less complex non-STS securitisations with the same rating. Ultimately, such risk seeking behaviour could endanger policyholder protection by lowering the risk-bearing capacity of insurers.\n\nSuch elements demonstrate that the current insurance capital requirements for non-STS securitisation goes beyond what is strictly necessary to ensure financial stability.\n\nUnlike for banks where STS capital charges are still an issue, for insurers the core problem is the non-STS segment of securitisation. The current capital requirements on senior tranches of STS securitisations are very close to those applicable to corporate bonds. Therefore, it is difficult to claim that prudential rules play a major role in the limited level of insurers\u2019 investments in senior tranches of STS securitisations 34 . In fact, insurers\u2019 investments in senior tranches of STS securitisations represent only 6% of total investments in securitisation. As for non-senior tranches of STS securitisations, the evaluation concludes that they are usually largely oversubscribed by various types of investors (i.e. much more demand than supply) and the capital requirements under Solvency II are coherent with those applicable under banking rules.\n\nThe evaluation\u00a0also identified factors other than undue prudential rules which can discourage insurers from investing in securitisation. According to EIOPA\u2019s 2022 advice on securitisation 35 \u00a0insurers typically focus on the \u2018financial risk / return profile\u2019 of an investment (and not the\u00a0\u2018prudential cost / return profile\u2019). Their investment strategies prioritise asset-liability management, particularly for insurance products with long-term liabilities and fixed cash flows. This applies not only to life insurers but also to many non-life insurers offering liability insurance. To manage risk, insurers may favour long-term, fixed-rate investments that protect them from fluctuations in interest rates and irregular cash inflows, both of which could weaken their capital position. The perceived complexity of securitisation as an asset class which requires extensive due diligence is another relevant factor.\n\nThere is however evidence that these factors should not be overstated. A Bank of America paper, drawing on market research, presents long-term data on investment portfolios of EU and US insurers and concludes that EU insurers were more active in the securitisation market before the Global Financial Crisis, which suggests that they saw value in these investments 36 . Moreover, US insurers are still significantly investing in securitisation, particularly for\u00a0long-term annuity products with regular cash outflows - securitisation represents on average 15% of their investment portfolio 37 . In addition, all consultation activities reported in Annex II point to both the willingness of insurers to ramp up their participation in the securitisation market and the hurdles generated by prudential rules. This contradicts the statement that securitisation is not appropriate to match long-term liabilities.\n\n2.2. What are the consequences? How likely is the problem to persist?\n\nThe problems outlined in Section 2.1 have resulted in a relatively small and unduly constrained EU securitisation market. High operational costs, driven by complexity, as well as due diligence and transparency costs, create a barrier for new issuers and investors to enter the market. As a result, only a limited number of issuers and investors that can afford these costs continue to operate. This limited investor base leads to fewer transactions, resulting in low market liquidity, which disincentivises issuers from using securitisation. In turn, limited supply makes the securitisation market unattractive for new investors to come in. Furthermore, as the prudential requirements associated with securitisation continue to be higher than those of other asset classes, prudentially regulated financial institutions are disinclined to issue or invest in securitisations.\n\nTogether, these high operational and prudential requirements reduce the competitiveness of the actors in the EU securitisation market. Financial institutions, businesses and households therefore do not fully reap the benefits that securitisation could offer in terms of risk diversification, capital market development and additional lending.\n\nIn the absence of regulatory action, it is difficult to envisage a change in the issuance and investment behaviour of financial institutions. In general, issuers and investors will continue to prefer financial instruments with lower operational and regulatory requirements. Banks\u2019 current strong preference for alternative, lower-cost instruments, such as covered bonds, is unlikely to change, and the issuance of traditional securitisation will likely remain subdued.\n\nThe continued operation of the EU securitisation market below its full potential represents a missed opportunity for Europe for funding strategic priorities and deepening the EU's capital markets. This, in turn, hinders the efficient financing of EU businesses and households. In addition, the securitisation market's potential to expand the universe of investable securities for institutional investors is not being fully utilised, ultimately limiting the depth and development of EU capital markets.\n\nInvestment needs will continue to grow, driven by digitalisation, decarbonisation, and defence spending. To meet these demands, the EU's investment-to-GDP ratio will need to return to levels last seen in the 1960s and 1970s.\u00a0To meet the objectives set out in the Draghi report: \u201c[T]he financing needs required for the EU to meet its objectives are massive, but productive investment is weak despite ample private savings. A minimum annual additional investment of EUR 750 to 800 billion is needed, based on the latest Commission estimates, corresponding to 4.4-4.7% of EU GDP in 2023\u201d 38 .\n\nThe benefits of securitisation, such as increased funding and capital market development, depend on how financial institutions choose to utilise the benefits brought by the instrument. A bank may use the additional balance sheet capacity gained through securitisation to increase lending, and deepen the capital market, or it may retain them for other purposes. Ultimately, this decision lies with the issuing bank. Regulation should not dictate a specific outcome. That being said, lending to the real economy is a core business of banks and a key driver of their profits. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that, all else being equal, a well-functioning securitisation market will incentivise banks to increase their lending to the real economy.\n\nQuantifying the exact impact on the real economy from releasing bank capital through securitisation\u00a0is, however, a challenging task. One respondent to the targeted consultation estimated that every EUR 10 bn risk-weighted assets that banks can securitise, rather than keep on their balance sheet, allows them to provide additional lending of EUR 15-20 bn. There are also several studies that show that there is a positive relationship between banks\u2019 released capital and loan supply. For instance, one study 39 provides evidence that banks' use of capital buffers can\u00a0benefit both the real economy and banks themselves, without a negative impact on the banks\u2019 resilience. Capital buffers are extra capital that banks hold above the minimum regulatory requirements and include buffers which are designed to be released at times of economic adversity. Banks\u2019 willingness to use the\u00a0capital buffers increases lending and\u00a0GDP and lowers credit losses. The study shows that, in stressed scenarios, a broad-based use of capital buffers could increase lending to the real economy by more than 3%, and GDP by over 0.5%.\n\nAll in all, the goal of the regulatory framework is not to limit the choices of issuers to a particular outcome, but rather to remove obstacles that might hinder the use of securitisation in its various applications. A more accessible securitisation market offers financial institutions enhanced opportunities to increase the financing capacity for key EU initiatives. Conversely, a failure to address the above shortcomings is likely to perpetuate and perhaps even aggravate the problems and barriers outlined in Section 2.\n\n3.\nWhy should the EU act?\n\n3.1. Legal basis\n\nThe regulatory requirements for the Securitisation Framework are already set at EU level. Consequently, the legal basis for the review will remain the same as the legal basis of the original legislative acts, namely Article 114 TFEU for SECR, Articles 111(1)(c) and 135(2) of the SII Directive empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts on the prudential treatment of investments, including securitisation, Article 114 TFEU for the CRR and Article 460 of CRR for the LCR Delegated Regulation.\n\n3.2. Subsidiarity: Necessity of EU action and Added value of EU action\n\nThe purpose of the review is to make the EU Securitisation Framework less burdensome, more principles-based, more proportionate and more risk-sensitive. In particular, the review examines certain provisions on due diligence, transparency and prudential (capital and liquidity) requirements. Only action at EU level can ensure that going forward, these regulatory provisions are applied uniformly and guarantee the existence of the well-established regulatory framework regarding the taking up and the pursuit of securitisation-related activity, including issuance and investment, across the Single Market.\n\nThe ability of Member States to adopt national measures is limited, given that the existing EU Securitisation Framework, already provides for a harmonised set of rules at EU level and that changes at national level would conflict with Union law currently in force.\n\n4.\nObjectives: What is to be achieved?\n\n4.1. General objectives\n\nThe general objective of the Securitisation Framework, as expressed in the impact assessment of 2015 accompanying the Commission\u2019s proposal was: \u201cto revive a safer securitisation market that will improve the financing of the EU economy, weakening the link between banks\u2019 deleveraging needs and credit tightening in the short run, and creating a more balanced and stable funding structure of the EU economy in the long run.\u201d The evaluation (Annex V, section 5) finds that this general objective has been only partially achieved because while the securitisation market is safer, the initiative has not been sufficient to revive the market or improve financing opportunities. Indeed, most of the measures that were introduced in the current framework aimed first and foremost to mitigate potential risks associated with securitisation, rather than support market development. Going forward, the objective is to strike a better balance between safety and market development. For this reason, most of the policy options presented below focus on developing further the EU securitisation market by making the framework more proportionate and risk-sensitive. This is the main difference with the approach taken in the 2015 Impact Assessment where safety was the main focus.\n\nAddressing the unattained objective of reviving the securitisation market will contribute to creating a more balanced and stable funding structure to increase the available financing for the EU economy. The achievement of this general objective requires the pursuit of several more specific policy objectives, such as transparency requirements for issuers, due diligence obligations for investors, and prudential requirements.\n\nThis initiative does not seek to\u00a0achieve\u00a0a specific target for the size or growth of the securitisation market, also not in comparison taking as reference the situation\u00a0in other jurisdictions. Instead, it focuses on creating an \u2018enabling framework\u2019 by removing regulatory barriers, allowing the market to develop in a more sustainable and resilient way without the risks of rigid issuance targets. Comparing the EU securitisation market to those in other regions can be misleading due to key differences in regulatory frameworks, particularities of financial markets, historical developments and structural characteristics 40 . Using other markets as a benchmark may overlook these important differences, leading to inaccurate conclusions or ineffective policy decisions. Each market has its unique characteristics and challenges requiring bespoke analysis and approaches.\n\nLast but not least, the objective focuses on removing undue barriers, instead of channelling funds for a specific purpose (i.e. allowing for bank capital relief only on the condition that they provide additional lending for specific purposes or to specific sectors of the economy). Prudential regulation is designed to ensure the stability of banks, insurers and the financial system, and to ensure an appropriate reflection of risks through proper capitalisation. Prudential regulation is not intended to serve as an instrument to promote the development of specific industries or branches of economic activity (for example tax policy \u2013 outside the scope of this initiative \u2013 is better suited for supporting specific sectors, activities, or purposes but tax policy is outside the scope of this initiative).\n\nIntroducing a conditions-based system is also technically very complex and challenging and would require in depth monitoring and compliance, which could deter banks from engaging in the securitisation activities to prevent charges for potential non-compliance. Introducing a conditions-based system is also technically very complex and challenging and would require in depth monitoring and compliance, which could deter banks from engaging in the securitisation activities to prevent charges for potential non-compliance. Setting up such a monitoring system would also require additional reporting, which would run against the idea of reducing the burden for market participants.\n\nOverall, introducing such conditionality in the banks\u2019 prudential framework could prove to be counterproductive and could negatively impact the effectiveness of the current initiative, in the end potentially defeating its primary objective. Considering the above, the current initiative does not aim to stimulate or impose constraints on banks\u2019 specific activities but focuses instead on economic incentives through removing undue prudential and non-prudential barriers. Also, naturally, the more risk sensitive and better calibrated framework will impact different types of securitisations differently. For example, a more risk sensitive prudential framework should make securitisations of low risk assets more attractive, as these would receive a better capital treatment.\n\nOverall, it is by means of a more risk-sensitive, more proportionate and better calibrated framework, that we aim to create conditions and environment for greater lending to the real economy. A well-functioning securitisation market will incentivise banks to be more active in the market ultimately also making them lend more to the economy.\n\n4.2. Specific objectives\n\nThe following specific objectives aim to address the three problems identified in Section 2:\n\n\u00b7\nReduce undue operational costs for issuers and investors balancing with robust and proportionate\u00a0standards of transparency, investor protection and supervision (linked to problem 1).\n\n\u00b7\nAdjust the prudential framework to better account for actual risks and remove undue prudential barriers for banks and insurers when issuing and investing in securitisations while at the same time safeguarding financial stability and consumer protection (linked to problem 2 and 3).\n\nDo we know how banks may use additional capital relief from the securitisation review?\n\nBanks which\u00a0have used securitisation to pool and transfer\u00a0certain exposures from their balance sheet 41 \u00a0(or for synthetic securitisations, transfer default risks thereof) will be able to use that freed-up capacity in their balance sheets\u00a0(in the form of freed capital) for new lending. In a traditional securitisation transaction, they will additionally obtain funding to do that. Encouraged by the positive experience with cost-efficient and accessible securitisation,\u00a0banks will also consider using this instrument again to \u201ctransfer out\u201d of the balance sheet\u00a0those new or other loans (or, as appropriate, default risks thereof) that can then be offered to willing buyers in a new securitisation transaction. Even if some banks might decide not to use capital relief obtained from securitisation for new lending (but e.g. to pay-out dividends or buy back shares), this will not be a prevailing pattern in the sector for which lending is the core activity. Productive and prudent use of a bank\u2019s balance sheets will be under continued scrutiny of supervisors and shareholders. Thus, the cumulative effect of wider use of securitisation can be expected to result in greater lending capacity\u00a0for EU\u00a0banking sector as a whole.\n\n5.\nWhat are the available policy options?\n\n5.1. What is the baseline from which options are assessed?\n\nIn the baseline scenario, the current EU rules on securitisation would remain unchanged.\n\nIn terms of non-prudential regulation, the SECR would continue to require investors to carry out a costly due diligence process. Similarly, it would continue to impose high costs for issuers to disclose when issuing a securitisation. As explained in the Evaluation, this translates into high operational costs (currently estimated annual recurring administrative costs of about EUR 780 million) that will continue to act as a deterrent for issuers and investors to be present on this market. The scope of the STS standard would remain unchanged in terms of the applicable qualifying criteria as well as the types of securitisations that it applies to. Other important requirements (which this initiative does not consider modifying), that require issuers to retain a share of the risk, to apply adequate credit granting criteria and that limit complexity by banning re-securitisations would continue to apply. We do not expect the number of market participants to increase, and it is possible that their number may decrease, with activity shifting to other markets with more favourable regulatory treatment.\n\nIn terms of the prudential regulation, there would be no change to the current framework determining the amount of capital that banks and insurers should set aside for the securitisation positions they hold. While the framework would continue to differentiate between the capital treatment of STS and non-STS securitisations (allowing lower capital for STS securitisation compared to non-STS securitisation), the capital requirements would continue to be overly conservative and not sufficiently sensitive to reduced risk levels that have been observed in the post-crisis period.\n\nThe rules governing the transfer of risk through securitisation (so-called \u2018Significant Risk Transfer\u2019 framework) would continue to feature some structural deficiencies and be accompanied with lengthy supervisory processes. In addition, there would be no change to the current strict rules on eligibility of securitisations as high-quality liquid assets for the calculation of banks\u2019 liquidity coverage ratio, and banks would continue to be disincentivised to use the securitisations to diversify their liquidity buffers. As explained in section 2.3 where we discuss in detail the consequences of the current framework and its problems, the baseline scenario is not expected to achieve the objectives of the Securitisation Framework, will discourage the use of securitisation and will not allow securitisation to contribute to the development of the SIU.\n\nThe impact of external factors on the development of the market in the absence of regulatory changes is uncertain (see section 2 for a more detailed explanation). In its monetary policy statement\u00a0on 17 April 2025 , the ECB lowered the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, easing financial conditions in the euro area. They explain that while the euro area has been building resilience to global shocks, the outlook remains uncertain due to rising trade tensions which can negatively affect confidence among households and firms. This heightened level of uncertainty can suppress investment and consumption, and thus negatively affect securitisation activity.\n\n5.2. Description of the policy options\n\nFigure 6: Overview of policy options\n\nAll the options that are presented require legislative changes. Options 1.1 and 1.2 require amending the Securitisation Regulation. Options 2.1, and 2.2 require amending the Capital Requirements Regulation and the Liquidity Coverage Ratio Delegated Regulation. Options 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3. require amending the Solvency II Delegated Regulation.\n\n5.2.1. Measures to reduce high operational costs\n\nTwo options are considered to reduce high operational costs for issuers and investors in the EU securitisation market (Problem 1). Even though reducing high operational costs was also an objective in the previous impact assessment, the approach taken to achieve this objective in this impact assessment is not the same as before. While the previous impact assessment tried to reduce operational costs by putting all requirements in one legal framework, this impact assessment focuses on simplifying burdensome requirements as much as possible while respecting the principles behind their introduction.\n\nOption 1.1 is based on the idea that the current due diligence and transparency framework for securitisation is generally sound but can be refined through targeted adjustments. By contrast, option 1.2 is based on the premise that existing measures to ensure market transparency and investor scrutiny are ill-suited to improve the situation in the securitisation market meaningfully. It therefore proposes a more fundamental change by eliminating specific due diligence requirements for securitisations and making disclosure to investors principles-based. These two distinct approaches were reflected in the responses to our targeted consultation, with some stakeholders advocating for tweaks to the existing framework and others arguing for more significant changes.\n\n5.2.1.1. Option 1.1. Targeted measures to reduce high operational costs\n\nOption 1.1 seeks to reduce operational costs for both issuers and investors by simplifying and removing certain due diligence and transparency requirements. This option would maintain the same level of market transparency, investor protection, and data quality for supervision, while reducing costs.\n\nFor investors, operational costs would be reduced by simplifying those current due diligence requirements\u00a0that are deemed redundant or overly prescriptive. This would include:\u00a0(1) removing all\u00a0verification requirements in Article 5(1) and 5(3)(c) of the Securitisation Regulation\u00a0where the responsible sell-side party is established and supervised in the EU 42 , (2) allowing for a tailored risk assessment depending on the type of securitisation position (i.e. less intensive due diligence for low risk tranches and repeat transactions), and (3) give investors in secondary market transactions (where a securitised tranche already held by one investor is sold to another investor) more time to document their due diligence. As EU competent authorities can enforce the Securitisation Framework on EU issuers, but not on non-EU entities, verification requirements would continue to apply to non-EU securitisations.\u00a0For the same reason, investors would be required to verify transactions issued by unsupervised EU entities.\n\nFor issuers, operational costs would be reduced by optimising the transparency framework. The disclosure templates for public transactions would be streamlined to reduce the number of obligatory data fields. This means carefully scrutinising the existing disclosure templates and removing fields that provide limited benefit to investors. To safeguard market transparency, the definition of public securitisations would be widened to capture e.g. transactions that do not involve issuing a prospectus but are admitted to trading. Under this option, private transactions would be required to report to securitisation repositories, using a simplified template. This would improve supervisory monitoring and market transparency. However, to maintain the confidentiality of private transactions, data from these transactions would not be publicly disclosed.\n\nThis approach would remove redundant and burdensome requirements, allowing for more tailored due diligence, while maintaining high standards of risk assessment and market transparency.\n\n5.2.1.2. Option 1.2. Significant measures to reduce high operational costs\n\nOption 1.2 comprises a broader set of measures to yield a more significant reduction in operational costs. This approach would introduce a more substantial change to the current framework that would entail accepting greater risks in terms of investor protection, market transparency and quality of supervision.\n\nUnder this option, mandatory securitisation-specific due diligence requirements would be removed for regulated investors (banks, insurers, UCITS and AIFMs), thus eliminating additional operational requirements and costs for regulated investors imposed by the SECR. This would not relieve regulated investors of the need to carry out due diligence, since the due diligence requirements under their respective sectoral legislations would still apply. In essence, removing the specific due diligence regime for securitisation transactions would mean that requirements for securitisations would be the same as for all other asset classes. Investors that do not have due diligence requirements under their own sectoral legislations would still be required to apply those requirements set out in the SECR.\n\nFor issuers, under this option transparency requirements would become principles based. The SECR would only specify the key information principles that securitisation disclosures should abide by. Instead of prescribing Commission-specified disclosure templates applicable to all securitisations, the method for disclosing information to investors and potential investors would be left to the discretion of market participants. A simplified reporting template would be retained for all transactions (private and public), for supervisory purposes only. As in Option 1.1, private transactions would also be required to report to securitisation repositories providing a safeguard for market transparency.\n\n5.2.2. Measures to reduce undue prudential barriers for banks\n\nTwo options are considered to address Problem 2. It is important to note that unlike the previous impact assessment that proposed to increase capital requirements across the board for all securitisations, the current impact assessment proposes to reduce these requirements for securitisations for which risks have been mitigated in the post-crisis period. As such, the approach taken in the previous impact assessment is different from the one taken now. The reason being that while the primary focus of the previous impact assessment was on making the market safer, the current impact assessment tries to strike a better balance between safety and market development.\n\n5.2.2.1. Option 2.1 Targeted changes to the existing prudential (capital and liquidity) framework for banks\n\nOption 2.1 entails introduction of targeted changes to the existing prudential (capital and liquidity) requirements applied to banks. It contains a set of measures that require amendments to both CRR and LCR.\n\nTargeted changes to the CRR would ensure that:\n\n\u00b7\nbanks can calculate the minimum capital they need to hold for their securitisation exposures in a more risk sensitive manner, meaning that the amount of capital could be adapted/reduced for securitisations where crucial risks driving the capital needs, such as agency and model risks, are mitigated, as evidenced in the evaluation; and\n\n\u00b7\nthe framework used by supervisors for assessing the transactions and endorsing the capital relief (the SRT Framework) is clearer, more robust and results in more efficient and coherent processes.\n\nTargeted changes to the LCR would address inconsistencies in the existing requirements that securitisations need to comply with, to be eligible for inclusion in the banks\u2019 liquidity buffer (while maintaining the existing scope of eligible securitisations, limited to senior tranches of STS traditional securitisations only).\n\nThe overall aim of option 2.1 is to reduce the main undue barriers for banks\u2019 issuance of securitisations stemming from the existing banking prudential rules, without resorting to a significant restructuring of the framework as a whole and limiting the scope of divergences from the international Basel standards. It focuses on those elements of the prudential framework that are assessed to have the most prominent effect on achievement of the above goal.\n\n5.2.2.2. Option 2.2. Radical overhaul of the exiting prudential (capital and liquidity) framework for banks\n\nOption 2.2 entails a set of measures that introduce a fundamental reorganisation of the current framework, specifically:\n\n\u2022\nRe-design of the existing capital framework, resulting in introducing entirely new formulas and methods\u00a0that banks would need to follow when calculating capital for their securitisation exposures;\n\n\u2022\nRemoval of the existing complex requirements for supervisors to check securitisation transactions and to endorse the capital relief (resulting in banks merely self-assessing their securitisations, without the need for checks by supervisors);\n\n\u2022\nSignificant relaxation of the requirements that securitisations need to comply with to be eligible for inclusion in banks\u2019 liquidity buffers, including extension of the scope of eligible securitisations for liquidity buffer purposes also to (senior tranches) of non-STS traditional securitisations.\n\nThe overall aim of option 2.2. is to significantly reduce the barriers for banks\u2019 issuance of securitisation, by means of substantial restructuring of the existing rules and loosening a number of existing requirements. The option 2.2. would result in material divergences from the international Basel standards.\n\n5.2.3. Measures to remove undue prudential costs for insurers to invest in the EU securitisation market\n\nIn order to remove the existing disincentives for insurers to invest in the EU securitisation market, three options are presented, all of which propose to reduce capital requirements for insurers. This would be done by amendments to the Solvency II Delegated Regulation 43 . The first and second option focus on non-STS securitisations only, while the third option applies to all securitisation transactions.\u00a0In the context of this review, one may question whether such continued focus on reducing capital requirements is justified, considering the moderate effect of the previous attempt to reduce capital requirements for STS securitisations (even if we still noted an increase of more than 50% in such investments between 2019 and 2023). Our assessment \u2013 as outlined in the evaluation \u2013 leads us to conclude that reducing capital requirements (in particular on non-STS securitisations) can help change insurers\u2019 investment behaviour for the following reasons:\n\n\u2022\nThere is evidence that insurers using an internal model \u2013 which results in general in lower capital requirements than under the standard formula \u2013 invest more than twice as much in securitisation than companies using the standard formula. While other factors can explain such a situation \u2013 in particular the average size of insurers using an internal model is larger than the average size of standard formula insurers \u2013 there are also very large standard formula insurers (for instance, insurance subsidiaries of large banking groups use the standard formula) which still invest negligible amounts in securitisation. Therefore, the comparison implies that it cannot be precluded that\u00a0capital requirements do play a role in insurers\u2019 investment decisions;\n\n\u2022\nIn all consultation activities conducted by Commission services\u00a0a majority view from stakeholders has been that capital requirements under Solvency II are perceived as an obstacle to investments in securitisations despite an appetite to increase exposure to this asset class;\n\n\u2022\nCapital charges in the previous framework for simple and transparent securitisation were high, but not as high as the current capital charges for non-STS securitisations. As a result, the impact of reducing capital charges for non-STS securitisations is likely to be more significant than the one already observed for STS after the last initiative.\n\n\u2022\nNon-STS securitisations represent a bigger share of the EU securitisation market. Consequently, decreasing capital charges for these types of securitisations will have a broader and more substantial impact on the market in absolute amounts.\n\n5.2.3.1. Option 3.1. Removing prudential barriers to investments in all non-STS securitisations\n\nUnder option 3.1, non-STS capital requirements would be decreased, removing the excessive level of prudence embedded in the current framework. The decrease in risk factors could be between 25% and 40% depending on the credit rating. By reducing the cost of investing in non-STS securitisation, this option would make investments in non-STS securitisation more attractive than under current rules.\n\n5.2.3.2. Option 3.2. Improving risk sensitivity and removing prudential barriers to investments in the safest tranches of non-STS securitisation\n\nUnder option 3.2, capital requirements on non-STS securitisation would be made more risk sensitive by differentiating between senior and non-senior tranches, as is the case for STS securitisation. The calibration approach would aim at some consistency with the banking calibrations.\n\nThe level of capital requirements for non-senior tranches would remain broadly in line with the current capital charges applicable to non-STS securitisation, whereas the capital requirements for senior tranches would be reduced by a factor of up to 5 depending on the credit rating of the senior tranche 44 . Reducing the capital requirements applicable to senior tranches of non-STS securitisation would remove the existing prudential disincentives to investments in this market segment.\n\n5.2.3.3. Option 3.3. Overhauling the prudential treatment of securitisation in order to make all securitisation investments relatively more \u2018attractive\u2019 than under current rules\n\nUnder option 3.3, the framework for securitisation (STS and non-STS) would be overhauled\u00a0to lower all capital requirements for securitisations. Stakeholder responses to the targeted consultation argued that the very low default probability of securitisation justifies\u00a0lower capital requirements across the board.\u00a0However, under the current rules, capital requirements for insurers capture spread risk (i.e. the exposure to volatility in market price of securitisation investments), which can be driven by several factors 45 , only one of which being default risk. Option 3.3 would therefore change the current framework to focus only\u00a0on default risk.\u00a0Since default risk is in essence a subset of spread risk, this overhaul would imply a significant reduction in risk factors (by up to 80% depending on the securitisation type and rating 46 ) for all (STS and non-STS) securitisation investments.\n\n5.3. Options discarded at an early stage\n\nThe identified options in the previous section have been defined based on stakeholder feedback received through our consultation, as well as our own evaluation of the framework. All the presented options are realistic and comprise elements of changes proposed by stakeholders. We did not assess extreme options that would risk compromising market integrity and financial stability, like strong deviations from the international Basel agreement.\u00a0\n\nRegarding operational costs and banking prudential requirements,\u00a0the options considered in the previous section cover the full spectrum of possible plausible options to address the problems identified. For each of the three problems, both \u2018targeted\u2019 and \u2018more radical\u2019 options are listed.\n\nRegarding insurance prudential requirements, it was decided to discard the possibility to increase the granularity of the STS category by introducing a dedicated prudential treatment for \u2018mezzanine\u2019 tranches. First, the evaluation shows that there is limited evidence that amending the prudential treatment of STS securitisation is an urgent need in view of the oversubscription of non-senior STS issuances 47 . In addition, this would add significant complexity (how to define \u2018mezzanine\u2019 in an objective manner, and set out harmonised characteristics in terms of tranche thickness) and inconsistency with banking rules where there is no explicit treatment for mezzanine tranches.\n\n6.\nWhat are the impacts of the policy options and how do they compare?\n\n6.1. Measures to reduce high operational costs\n\n6.1.1. Option 1.1 Targeted measures reduce high operational costs\n\n6.1.1.1. Benefits\n\nSimplifying the due diligence requirements, as outlined in option 1.1, would substantially lower the additional costs imposed by the SECR on investors by eliminating the verification requirements for regulated investors when investing in securitisations originated by entities subject to supervision in the EU. Verification requirements were consistently cited by investors as a key driver of the costs imposed by the SECR.\n\nRemoving the requirement for investors to verify that an STS securitisation complies with the STS criteria would reduce the due diligence cost for investing in such transactions. This is expected to increase the price that investors would be willing to pay for an STS securitisation, thereby increasing the attractiveness of using the STS label for issuers. Even though investors would no longer be checking that a transaction complies with the STS criteria, the integrity of the label is not undermined as supervisors would still be checking this as is currently required under the Securitisation Regulation. Moreover, originators and sponsors are liable for sanctions in case they misleadingly or erroneously label a transaction as STS and they can also rely on the services of external third-party verifiers of STS compliance.\n\nIn addition, making the risk\u00a0assessment principles-based would ensure that investors still analyse the key structural features and risk characteristics of a securitisation transaction while at the same time providing them with sufficient flexibility to look at those structural features and risk characteristics that are most relevant for the type of transaction they wish to invest in. This would be beneficial for investors that primarily invest in low-risk senior positions, allowing them to carry out a lighter and more targeted risk assessment than for investors that invest in high-risk first loss tranches 48 .\u00a0\n\nFinally, simplified requirements for repeat securitisations 49 would incentivise standardisation, as it would be less costly to invest in a\u00a0series of transactions with similar characteristics issued by the same originator. Simplified requirements for secondary market transactions would make it easier to invest in the secondary market 50 , thereby increasing market liquidity.\n\nAt the moment, stakeholder feedback suggests that the additional burden imposed by the due diligence requirements in the SECR is the highest for a AAA-rated tranche with a repeat issuer in the secondary market. According to market perceptions, the due diligence costs for these transactions are\u00a0up to 75% higher than what would be incurred in the regular course of business (without the requirements imposed by the SECR). On the other hand, due diligence for a new issuer is\u00a0estimated to be only approx.\u00a033% higher due to\u00a0the due diligence requirements imposed by the SECR 51 .\u00a0This finding shows a lack of risk\u00a0sensitivity in the current framework that needs to be remedied in order to reduce costs. On average, based on information received from stakeholders we estimate a savings potential of about 44% 52 .\n\nDue to the duplicative or redundant nature of the provisions that are proposed to be removed, no negative impacts can be expected on the ability of investors to analyse the risks of individual transactions, as well as on the possible emergence of macro financial stability risks in the securitisation market.\n\nIn the area of transparency, option 1.1 would improve the current reporting burden by reducing the number of obligatory data fields, in particular those that are redundant or that refer to the information that is unavailable or irrelevant for the particular type of securitisation. The impact of this measure might vary for different types of securitisations, depending on the number of fields that would be removed. It might be possible to achieve a higher reduction in certain templates in comparison to others, without compromising investor protection. For example, the disclosure costs for issuers of private securitisations would be significantly reduced by introducing a dedicated, simplified disclosure template for this type of deals. Both private and public securitisations would benefit from option 1.1 as it would reduce the current reporting requirements and potentially allow to securitise assets, for which certain data was uneconomical to collect.\n\nMost respondents, however, did not specify by how much option 1.1 would reduce costs, as this would depend on the concrete details of the change that were not presented in the high-level-description in the stakeholder consultation. Of the few replies received to this question, most respondents spoke of a \u201cminor\u201d or \u201cmoderate\u201d expected reduction of\u00a0their total costs. This is due to the fact that\u00a0established issuers already incurred the bulk of the costs in the past during the implementation of the required templates. A reduction in one-off costs will, however, be very relevant for new players that are considering entering the securitisation market and that currently\u00a0would not do so due to the very high one-off costs. Respondents also\u00a0estimate a reduction of annual recurring reporting costs between 15%-25% (full range with an average of 22,5%),\u00a0which will be partly offset by the estimated additional costs of approximately 7 million that would\u00a0result from the reporting of private transactions to securitisation repositories. 53\n\nFurthermore, lower one-off costs would benefit all types of new issuers entering the market by making it less costly, in comparison to the baseline, to set up the reporting framework.\n\nIn widening the legal definition for public securitisations, option 1.1 would support overall market transparency, as fewer transactions would qualify as private and be eligible to use the simplified reporting regime. Moreover, removing the current exemption that allows private securitisations to avoid reporting to securitisation repositories, would facilitate the ability of supervisors to monitor the private side of the securitisation market, and thus reduce supervisory costs for this part of the market. Therefore, option 1.1 is also expected to benefit supervision as supervisors would obtain access to data for the entire securitisation market, both public and private, via the securitisation repositories.\n\nOverall, the changes proposed to the due diligence and transparency requirements are estimated to result in EUR 310 million of cost savings per year for the EU securitisation market.\n\n6.1.1.2. Costs\n\nWhile option 1.1 is expected to have a positive impact on investors' recurring due diligence costs, there will be a trade-off in terms of the cost of supervisory efforts. Adopting a more principles-based approach to risk assessment may require supervisors to dedicate more time and resources to understanding investors' risk management practices. Moreover, removing the verification requirements for investors may require supervisors to dedicate more resources to supervise the compliance of issuers with the sell-side requirements (risk retention, transparency, credit granting standards). Option 1.1 could also result in more divergent supervisory approaches. For this reason, it may be useful to develop supervisory guidance and enhance cooperation to ensure that option 1.1 does not result in an uneven playing field.\n\nOption 1.1 would imply one-off adjustment costs for all existing issuers due to having to adapt to new disclosure templates.\n\nThere was no sufficient evidence in the stakeholder consultation on the one-off implementation efforts to adapt to a simplified reporting as proposed in option 1.1 as stakeholders could not assess the costs without detailed and concrete proposal listing all the required data fields. However, one securitisation repository provided an estimate of their adjustment costs for the described adaptation to be about EUR 50,000-70,000. If we take this reply as a rough estimate with a conservative margin, we estimate the adaptation costs to EUR 100,000 per issuer (assuming that existing data fields are re-used to a maximum extent) and that approx. 330 active issuers in the market incur the same cost on average (there will be smaller players operating without IT infrastructure and larger players with more complex IT systems and changes), we obtain one-off implementation costs of EUR 33 million for the market as a whole.\n\nOn the one hand, private issuers will benefit from the simplified reporting template and therefore will face lower recurring reporting costs compared to the baseline 54 .\u00a0On the other hand, private issuers will face\u00a0additional recurring costs resulting from the obligation to report to securitisation repositories. Based on the current fees charged by securitisation repositories, those costs are less than EUR 10,000 per year per transaction 55 . For an estimated number of 700 outstanding private transactions, this amounts to about EUR 7 million annually. 56\n\n6.1.1.3. Overall assessment: Effectiveness, efficiency and coherence\n\nOption 1.1 will lower the recurring costs investors face when complying with the due diligence requirements in the SECR. However, the impact would not be the same for all types of securitisations. Recurring due diligence costs for EU issued securitisations would be reduced to a greater extent than for non-EU securitisations. This would be an acceptable outcome because EU transactions are supervised according to the SECR, whereas this is not the case for transactions issued outside of the EU.\n\nAt the same time, option 1.1 would not significantly change the risk assessment that an investor needs to carry out in order to invest in a securitisation. Therefore, this option would result in the same level of investor protection as the baseline.\n\nAs regards issuers, option 1.1 will reduce operational costs by reducing the amount of information that issuers are required to disclose. The long-term impact of reducing annual recurring costs will be more than sufficient to offset the impact of the one-off costs that need to be incurred by issuers to adapt to the revised type of reporting. This option is also expected to facilitate market entry as it would entail lower one-off costs for new issuers compared to the baseline.\n\nOption 1.1 will improve market transparency relative to the baseline as a higher share of securitisations will be expected to report to securitisation repositories.\n\nThe overall impact on the cost of supervision is expected to be neutral as the need for more oversight over compliance with due diligence would be offset by lower need for resources to supervise disclosure.\n\nOption 1.1 would continue to be coherent with the rest of the Securitisation Framework (i.e. \u2018internal coherence\u2019), as well as with other pieces of financial legislation and with international standards (i.e. \u2018external coherence\u2019).\n\n6.1.1.4. Stakeholders\u2019 views\n\nIn general, both the industry and the supervisors support option 1.1. Many respondents to the targeted consultation indicated that implementing option 1.1 could be expected to result in higher securitisation issuance, thereby contributing to the general objective.\n\nOption 1.1 was preferred by many respondents under the condition that it would mean keeping the structure of the current templates that are already implemented while introducing flexibility by using the \u201cno-data-option \u2013 ND\u201d more extensively. For very granular transactions, i.e. transactions pooling thousands of underlying exposures such as credit card receivables, removing the requirement of loan-by-loan reporting and instead allowing for aggregate reporting could also be considered. Flexibility of the\u00a0required format 57 and allowing the inclusion of additional data would also be welcomed by certain issuers to better meet the needs of investors. Some respondents pointed also to further reporting with similar content, e.g. securitisation reporting required by the ECB or national competent authorities. Alignment and data sharing between authorities could have beneficial effects for the reporting entities.\n\nRegarding the removal of STS verification, some supervisors argue that this should be contingent on introducing supervision requirements for STS third-party verifiers (TPVs) 58 , whereas the industry seems to think that TPVs are already supervised under the SECR. Removing verification requirements, and in particular STS verification, is the main ask from stakeholders in the\u00a0area of due diligence.\n\nRegarding transparency, issuers warn that requiring private securitisations to report to the securitisation repositories would increase compliance costs for those transactions, which runs contrary to the policy goal of burden reduction. Moreover, stakeholders warn that disclosure requirements for private securitisations should take into account confidentiality and data breach risks.\n\nOption 1.1 would not negatively affect financial stability. In terms of disclosure, option 1.1 still requires enough information about the characteristics and performance of the underlying exposure and the structural features of the transaction to be disclosed to investors so they can carry out a proper risk assessment. Regarding due diligence, option 1.1 still requires investors to meaningfully assess the risks associated with securitisation. Supervisors are still expected to pay close attention to the activities of the securitisation parties.\n\n6.1.2. Option 1.2: Significant measures to reduce high operational costs\n\n6.1.2.1 Benefits\n\nOption 1.2 would remove all operational costs (recurring plus one-off) associated with the due diligence requirements in the SECR for EU regulated investors that go beyond the usual course of business and what would be required by their respective sectoral regulations in the absence of Art. 5 SECR. According to stakeholder feedback, the one-off costs to set up an investment business that would invest in securitisations, associated with the implementation of existing due diligence requirements only, are about EUR 130,000 per entity. If the existing due diligence requirements no longer apply, those costs and time-investment would no longer have to be incurred by new market entrants, which would facilitate market entry.\n\nThis would not exempt EU investors from conducting due diligence when investing in securitisations, but it would eliminate the need for investors to comply with due diligence requirements stipulated in the SECR on top of the due diligence requirements outlined in their respective sectoral legislations. In practice, investors would still need to adhere to the due diligence standards specific to their sector, just as they are required to do so when investing in other financial instruments. Investors that do not have due diligence provisions within their own sectoral legislations would still have to apply the due diligence requirements in the SECR.\n\nThe main beneficiaries from such an approach would be those investors for which the existing due diligence requirements result in an additional effort on top of their regular due diligence process. According to the result from the targeted consultation, the costs added by the due diligence requirements in the SECR vary significantly depending on the type of respondent. Some large and experienced asset managers report additional costs as low as 0%. This is the case because they already carried out similar due diligence procedures as those required under the SECR before its entry into force. For other small, regulated institutional investors that carry out different due diligence procedures than those stipulated under the SECR or for other new market entrants option 1.2 could, however, potentially save a significant amount of administrative costs.\n\nIn addition to reducing costs, option 1.2 would also lead to a level playing field between securitisations and other financial instruments that are not subject to additional specific due diligence requirements. In turn, this would incentivise EU investors to invest more in securitisations. One may reasonably expect that greater investor interest in securitisations would be followed by the emergence of a wider and more diverse securitisation offer (greater issuance), thus supporting the role of securitisation in funding the EU\u2019s economy (see introduction section for a more detailed explanation of what securitisation is and how it can support the EU economy). This option would also benefit new EU regulated investors as it will not be necessary for them set up dedicated processes to comply with the existing due diligence requirements in the SECR.\n\nOption 1.2 would reduce operational costs for all issuers relative to the baseline scenario. The reduction will impact start-up costs in particular, as this approach would give issuers the flexibility to customize their disclosures for each specific deal rather than having to abide by a prescribed disclosure template and format. This is expected to be less costly than the current one-size-fits-all approach, which is often reported to fail to meet the specific characteristics of securitisation transactions and unique investor needs.\n\nOption 1.2 would not require issuers to disclose information that investors find superfluous and that they do not use when making investment decisions. Overall, this streamlined approach should make the disclosure process more straightforward and useful to certain market participants, while not adversely impacting the reporting of information necessary for supervisory purposes.\n\nAt the same time, by requiring all securitisations (public and private) to report to securitisation repositories with a single supervisory template, market transparency would be enhanced in comparison to the baseline scenario where only public transactions are obliged to report to repositories. This would allow investors, supervisors and market analysts to get a better view of the market, lowering information asymmetry, enhancing price formation and supporting the further development of the EU securitisation market.\n\n6.1.2.2. Costs\n\nWith regard to due diligence, no significant adjustment costs are expected under option 1.2. As for supervisory costs, the impact is likely to be neutral as regards securitisations issued by EU entities as supervisors are already responsible for overseeing due diligence rules in sectoral legislation.\n\nIn the area of transparency, option 1.2 would imply some adjustment costs for existing issuers as they would have to adapt their reporting systems. These costs should be comparable to option 1.1 as the new template would build on the existing reporting requirements only with significantly fewer mandatory data fields than the current set of templates.\n\nAs regards supervisors, the reduced reliance on standardised reporting for investors would make it more costly to ensure that issuers disclose sufficient information to investors. Moreover, due diligence costs might increase as a result of option 1.2 for transparency, as investors would have less readily available information on other deals, besides the one they are directly investing in.\n\n6.1.2.3. Overall assessment: Effectiveness, efficiency and coherence\n\nOption 1.2 would be the most effective in reducing operational costs for all issuers and investors relative to the baseline scenario.\n\nWith regard to due diligence, however, there is a risk that this option would be incoherent with international standards, in particular with respect to the recommendation by the Financial Stability Forum (later succeeded by Financial Stability Board), to ensure stronger requirements for investors\u2019 processes for investment in structured products 59 .\u00a0In addition, reducing due diligence standards too much might also facilitate investments by inexperienced investors who might not be capable of assessing comprehensively the relevant risks of the transaction, which could put financial stability at risk. \u00a0\n\nRegarding transparency, the reduction in recurring costs is expected to be comparable with that achieved by option 1.1. Disclosure will still be required, but the regulation will rely on the best efforts of issuers subject to market control (if investors are not happy with the disclosure, they will not invest). The primary beneficiaries would be new issuers, who would not be burdened with high one-off costs to set up the reporting framework required in the baseline scenario.\n\nSupervisory control is improved from the baseline as private securitisations would also report to the securitisation repositories, but not to the same level as in option 1.1, as the disclosure templates will provide less information (at least for \u201cpublic\u201d securitisations).\n\nOverall market transparency should be sufficient but may decrease from the baseline because: i) disclosure from issuers to investors may not always be visible to the entire market, ii) data would no longer be available for public transactions in a uniform and standardised format, and iii) the information disclosed via repositories will be limited.\n\nAlthough Option 1.2 is more ambitious than Option 1.1, it would not lower requirements to such an extent that financial stability could be at risk. In terms of disclosure, Option 1.2 still requires enough information about the characteristics and performance of the underlying exposure and the structural features of the transaction to be disclosed to investors so they can carry out a proper risk assessment. Moreover, even if securitisation specific due diligence rules are eliminated under Option 1.2, investors will still be required to meaningfully assess the risks associated with securitisation in line with their own sectoral legislation.6.1.2.4. Stakeholder views\n\nRegarding transparency, there is no support from supervisors for option 1.2. Some industry participants are supportive of this option, but most prefer option 1.1 (45 respondents preferred option 1.1, 12 respondents preferred option 1.2, 3 respondents did not want any changes to the current regime and 43 respondents did not answer). Many industry stakeholders warned that it is difficult to estimate the potential savings that Option 1.2 might bring. One large market player pointed out that \u201cif the overall volume of data does not change or if data is difficult to obtain and/or highly complex \u2026, the cost reduction could be lower than expected\u201d.\n\nRegarding due diligence, option 1.2 was not explicitly discussed with either market participants or supervisors. However, from the consultation responses, it appears that some industry participants think that due diligence requirements in sectoral legislation are sufficient and that specific due diligence requirements for securitisation in addition to sectoral due diligence requirements are not needed. Although option 1.2 was not explicitly discussed with supervisors, based on previous discussions on this topic, we expect that they would not favour this option since most of them seem to support the idea of having additional due diligence requirements for securitisations.\n\n6.1.2.5.

Measures to reduce undue prudential barriers for banks\n\n6.2.1. Option 2.1: Targeted changes to the existing prudential (capital and liquidity) framework for banks\n\nHigh level description of the securitisation capital framework in the CRR\n\nThe current prudential securitisation framework for banks (set out in the CRR, which implements the Basel III securitisation framework),\u00a0has significantly increased capital requirements for banks\u2019 securitisation exposures compared to the previous regime: as a measure of prudence a considerable level of overcapitalisation (or the so-called \u2018non-neutrality\u2019) was introduced, to address the agency and model risks inherent to securitisation transactions.\u00a0\u2018Non-neutrality\u2019 of capital requirements means that holding all the securitisation tranches in a securitisation is subject to a higher capital charge than in a counterfactual where the bank has a direct holding of all the underlying non-securitised assets. 60 \u00a0\n\nMore specifically, there are two correction factors in the CRR capital framework that safeguard and ensure the capital \u2018non-neutrality\u2019, of the framework: (i) a risk weight floor for exposures to the senior tranche \u2013 which defines an absolute minimum risk weight for banks\u2019 exposures to the senior tranche of securitisation \u2013 i.e. even if the calculation of capital requirements for that tranche results in lower risk weights, the risk weight floor needs to be applied to prevent excessively low resulting risk weights; and (ii) a (p) factor (\u2018penalty factor\u2019) which defines the relative capital surcharge for all securitisation exposures, compared to the capital requirement for the underlying pool of exposures. In terms of impact on individual tranches, the risk weight floor to senior tranches influences the capital requirement for senior tranches only, while the (p) factor influences the capital requirements for all tranches, not just the senior one. Each bank needs to reflect the risk weight floor and the (p) factor in the calculation of the minimum capital requirement that applies to their securitisation exposures.\n\nAnother important element of the securitisation capital framework is the Significant Risk Transfer (SRT) framework, which set out tests and rules that supervisors need to follow, when assessing whether the bank has transferred a sufficient amount of risk through a specific securitisation to external investors, and whether as a consequence, it achieves the capital relief (i.e. it is allowed to reduce the capital it has to hold, after securitisation).\n\nOption 2.1 entails targeted amendments towards a more risk-sensitive design of banks\u2019 capital and liquidity requirements, in the CRR and in the LCR Delegated Act, where undue requirements would be limited.\n\nThe targeted changes to the CRR aim to achieve the following objectives: (i) introduce more risk sensitivity into the framework, while supporting financial stability; (ii) reduce unjustified levels of conservatism and capital non-neutrality; (iii) mitigate undue discrepancies between the standardised and internal rating-based approaches for the calculation of capital requirements for securitisation, which should also encourage greater participation of medium-sized banks; (iv) differentiate the prudential treatment for originators/sponsors of securitisations and investors; and (v) make the significant risk transfer framework more robust and predictable. This is achieved through targeted changes to the securitisation capital framework, and to the significant risk framework, in the CRR. The targeted changes to the securitisation capital framework are focused on the above mentioned two elements that have the most significant and direct impact on the capital requirements: the risk weight floor for the senior tranches and the (p) factor.\n\nThe proposed changes (and capital reductions in percentage changes) are targeted on (i) the senior tranches, where the exposures of banks are concentrated and where there is space to reduce the excessive conservativeness (the focus is less on the riskier junior and mezzanine tranches); (ii) on originator positions where agency and model risks are reduced (rather than investor positions); (iii) on STS securitisations where the STS requirements largely mitigated the agency and model risks (rather than non-STS securitisations). This focus behind the changes (i.e. away from banks investing in non-STS or away from relaxing the prudential treatment for the more risky tranches) is also consistent and in line with the objective to transfer the risk outside of the banking system towards those that may be better placed to bear those risks.\n\nWith respect to the risk weight floors for senior tranches, the current framework is not risk-sensitive, as it allows only for two risk weight floors for senior tranches (a 10% risk weight floor for STS transactions, and a 15% risk weight floor for non-STS transactions). Under this option, the risk weight floors are made risk sensitive: they are made proportional to the riskiness of the underlying securitised portfolio. A lower risk weight floor is calculated for securitisations of assets that are deemed less risky (i.e. that have relatively low risk weights), such as residential mortgages or SME and corporate exposures, in comparison to securitisations of riskier assets. To prevent excessive reductions, the risk weight floors calculated under this risk-sensitive formula will be subject to pre-defined minimum levels.\n\nMoreover, building on the proposals in the 2022 Joint Committee Report, the concept of \u2018resilient securitisations\u2019 is introduced: securitisations which feature reduced agency and model risk, and which comply with a set of safeguards 61 that ensure the resilience of the transactions and the protection of the senior tranche. These transactions would benefit from a lower risk weight floor and lower (p) factor for the senior tranche, compared to non-resilient transactions. The resilient transactions safeguards are adjusted compared to the 2022 Report, to capture a larger part of the securitisation market, while still ensuring prudent results.\n\nWith respect to the (p) factor, under the standardised approach (SEC-SA), targeted changes are introduced to the (p) factor to address an excessively punitive capital treatment, for senior tranches.\u00a0Under the internal rating-based approach (SEC-IRBA), formula-outcome scaling factors and floors to the (p) factor are lowered and caps are introduced, in particular for senior tranches.\n\nAs regards the significant risk framework, the proposed changes aim to make the framework more robust by replacing the current prescriptive tests for assessing the amount of risk transferred in securitisation, which is a precondition for the bank to benefit from the capital relief through securitisation, by the Principle Based Approach (PBA) test, as proposed by EBA in 2020. The PBA test addresses the limitations of the current tests which fail to ensure the transfer of risk to third parties in some cases, and specifically aims at the transfer of the unexpected losses of the securitised portfolio. Supervisors would maintain the flexibility to adapt supervisory assessments of transactions with complex features. The main elements of the SRT assessment and the broad design of the test would be defined in the CRR. EBA would be mandated to deliver technical standards which would operationalise the technical details of the test and would set high level principles for the supervisory process, including for a fast-track process for simpler transactions.\n\nBefore proceeding to analysis of impacts, it should also be clarified that the impact of the proposed changes to the capital and liquidity for securitisation for banks on their issuance and investment behaviour differs based on the type of securitisation transaction (i.e. whether it concerns traditional or synthetic securitisation) and the role of the bank in the securitisation transaction (i.e. whether the bank originates the transaction or invests in it). These particularities have been taken into account when designing the measures under each option and when assessing their impact on the securitisation market.\n\nThe main objective of synthetic securitisation is capital and credit risk management, as banks sell and transfer out risk and achieve SRT to achieve capital relief. The originator bank normally retains the senior tranche and sells the mezzanine tranche which contains higher risk, to achieve SRT. Banks are not investing in synthetic securitisations. Securitisation prudential rules have therefore direct impact on synthetic securitisations.\n\nOn the other hand, traditional securitisations are issued mostly for funding purposes i.e. to get access to cash/funds. This is achieved by selling senior tranches (hence, contrary to synthetic transactions, here the senior tranche is sold and is no longer capitalised). 62 \u00a0Banks are important investors in the senior tranches of traditional securitisations, as the latter are eligible for their LCR liquidity buffers. Overall, in the case of traditional securitisations, the securitisation prudential rules mostly impact banks that invest in the senior tranches. The treatment of these securitisations under the LCR is considered to be the more important driver for banks\u2019 investments in these securitisations.\n\nThe securitisation rules in the CRR apply to bank originators (i.e. to the exposures they retain in the securitisation they have originated \u2013 subject to the condition that significant risk transfer is achieved), bank sponsors (i.e. to tranches they sponsor) as well as to bank investors (i.e. to the tranches they have bought).\n\n6.2.1.1. Benefits\n\nOption 2.1 would make the capital requirements for banks\u2019 securitisation exposures more risk-sensitive by reducing the amount of capital that banks are required to hold for securitisations where key risks driving the securitisation capital needs, such as agency and model risks, have been mitigated. These risks are lower, for example, from the perspective of an originator (who has more detailed knowledge and control over the underlying exposures and the securitisation origination process than an investor), or in case of STS transactions (because STS criteria largely mitigate the agency and model risks).\n\nRevising the capital framework in a risk-sensitive manner is expected to reduce excessive overcapitalisation by better aligning the capital treatment with the underlying risks. Targeted revisions would also mitigate undue discrepancies in the capital requirements for different banks using different approaches for the calculation of their securitisation capital requirements (concretely, more coherence would be introduced between more sophisticated internal approaches and less sophisticated standardised approaches).\n\nThe proposed revisions are expected to have a positive impact on market developments, as follows:\n\n\u00b7\nThey should lead to an increase in issuance by banks of securitisations\u00a0which achieve SRT, as a more favourable prudential treatment is expected to increase the attractiveness of securitisation as a tool for risk sharing purposes. The changes should affect mostly synthetic securitisations (which are primarily structured for SRT purposes), but it should also encourage issuance of traditional securitisations which are done for SRT purposes and where senior tranches are sold to the market.\n\n\u00b7\nMore banks could decide to issue, notably less sophisticated banks using the standardised approach might have better incentives to enter the market as issuers. In 2024, over 70 banks issued securitisation that achieved SRT; this number is expected to increase.\n\n\u00b7\nThe measures should also positively impact banks\u2019 investments in senior tranches of STS traditional securitisations (acknowledging that the liquidity treatment of these securitisations in the LCR has a more pronounced effect on the attractiveness of the banks to invest in these securitisation).\u00a0Currently, in the primary market, according to market estimates, the oversubscription for senior tranches has been on average 1.5/1.7 of investor per senior tranche on average in 2024; this number is expected to increase.\n\nWhile the reduction of the capital requirements for individual securitisation transactions is expected to be potentially significant, the overall impact on the capital of banks would be quite limited, because of the very small weight of securitisation exposures in their total exposures. Indeed, the risk-weighted assets corresponding to banks\u2019 securitisation positions currently represents only 1.5% of the banks\u2019 total risk-weighted assets (according to EBA, as of December 2024).\n\nAs regards the use of traditional securitisation for funding purposes, the total outstanding securitisation funding represented 0.4% of EU banks\u2019 total balance sheet as of December 2023 (compared to 63.1% of funding coming from deposits and 5.4% coming from covered bonds, for example). This means that on aggregate traditional securitisation is very scarcely used as a source of banks\u2019 funding, although it could be an important funding instrument for some banks. It is expected that the measures under option 2.1 will increase this share but the overall impact on banks\u2019 funding mix would likely not be substantial.\n\nOn the impact of the proposed measures, based on informal checks with supervisors and indicative figures covering a sample of anonymised existing SRT securitisations, the reductions of the risk weight floors and (p) factors are expected to result in reductions of capital requirements for senior tranches by approximately one third, on average. These estimates should be interpreted with caution as they are subject to a number of caveats (as explained below).\n\nThe measures are expected to reduce the levels of capital required for securitisation, but still in a prudent way. The overall amount of capital for securitisation would always be approximately at least 20% higher compared to the capital of the underlying exposures, based on the principle of non-neutrality and prudence (as the (p) factor would never be lower than 0.2, even for the least risky transactions).\n\nRespondents to the consultation provided unverifiable estimates of the impact of changes to the securitisation framework on additional lending. One respondent wrote that every EUR 10 bn of risk-weighted assets that banks can securitise, rather than keep on their balance sheet, allows banks to provide additional lending of EUR 15-20 bn 63 . Another respondent suggests that 71% of the capital released or funding generated by SRT securitisations is currently used for further lending to the EU economy; and that this percentage would likely increase with the proposed measures.\u00a0\n\nAll these quantitative estimates should however be interpreted with caution. There is significant uncertainty in all the estimates and in modelling the outcomes of the proposed measures in general, as estimates rely on several assumptions and they have the following main limitations:\n\n\u00b7\nFirst and foremost, static and mechanistic comparisons are limited as they do not allow to take into account the behavioural changes or the modification in the structuring of the products themselves, which makes comparability and achieving reliable and accurate estimates difficult. This is especially relevant for securitisations, where banks structure the securitisation transactions according to the applicable regulation (and hence banks would structure securitisation transactions differently under two different regulatory regimes). \u00a0\n\n\u00b7\nSecond, it is difficult to quantify the amount of capital that would be relieved from the banking system altogether, as there are various external variables that come into play, such as the overall number of issuer banks, the number of investors and the overall volume of issued securitisation transactions, which are difficult to predict as they also depend on wider macro-economic and interest rate environments etc. \u00a0\n\n\u00b7\nThird, the quantification is complicated by the fact that it assesses the impact of a series of measures including several parameters, rather than a single measure and a single parameter (i.e. even if one could provide an estimate of the impact of the changes to the floor parameters \u2013 and this is already subject to a number of limitations as mentioned above \u2013 it is impossible to provide a reasonable quantitative estimation of the combined effect of the measures); \u00a0\n\n\u00b7\nFourth, the\u00a0impact also depends on response to the incentives set by the prudential treatment for originators and investors, which are more difficult to quantify. The overall amount of released capital depends also on the impact of the SRT framework and the SRT rules on the overall issuance, which are also expected to change, under the Option 2.1. A decisive factor in this respect is also the complexity of the securitisation structures that banks might decide to use: if banks have simple standardised structures, this might ease the life of investors and supervisors and provide more relief overall thanks to the increased number of issuances, compared to individual more complex issuances which might provide more benefits only if seen in isolation.\u00a0\n\nTaking all the above into account, the most important impact of option 2.1 is therefore qualitative, and that is that it would make the use of securitisation more attractive as a tool for risk transfer and capital relief, with smaller transaction costs (related to due diligence and transparency) and a broader investor base.\n\nThe measures under option 2.1 will help banks achieving capital relief in a more efficient way \u2013 i.e. they will allow banks to achieve the same amount of capital relief by selling less risk, or they will allow banks to increase the capital relief for the same amount of risk transferred \u2013 while still ensuring prudent levels of capital.\n\nThe estimates are even more complicated in the context of the introduction of the output floor, which will progressively change the incentives for banks to move out exposures from their balance sheet (and in a way that differs individually from bank to bank).\n\nWith respect to significant risk transfer, the proposed changes would address the structural flaws of the current SRT framework. For example, a number of transactions can pass the existing tests even though they may not necessarily transfer a sufficient amount of risk in economic terms in all cases. This structural flaw may result in a weakening of the capital position of the bank since the capital relief that is obtained is not justified from an economic perspective. The replacement of the existing tests with a new test would allow to address identified flaws and would ensure that a significant risk transfer effectively occurs, so that the capital relief achieved by the originator through that securitisation transaction is justified. This is not expected to result in increased number of supervisory objections to the SRT for specific transactions; rather, the aim is to ensure that the rules that supervisors follow when assessing the transactions before the SRT validations are clearer and more solid where possible.\n\nIn addition, the efficiency of the process of the SRT supervisory assessments would be enhanced by providing some harmonised high-level principles, allowing for a simpler and quicker supervisory assessment process for simple transactions.\n\nThe proposed changes to the SRT framework would increase the reliability and predictability of the SRT assessments, while ensuring the efficiency of the process, as well as the supervisory discretion to decide on the prudent treatment of transactions. The proposed changes are expected to result in increased market volumes and efficiencies when transferring risks from banks\u2019 balance sheets to existing and new investors, freeing up banks\u2019 lending capacities. All in all, an enhanced SRT framework would be beneficial for all stakeholders (originators, investors and supervisors) and for both traditional and synthetic transactions.\n\nWith respect to the liquidity treatment, targeted revisions to the liquidity framework would address some inconsistencies in the current eligibility conditions. These targeted changes would strengthen the incentives for banks to invest in publicly traded STS traditional securitisations, which would have a positive impact on the market liquidity and volume of these securitisations. It would thus deepen this segment of the securitisation market and diversify banks\u2019 liquidity buffers and risk profiles.\n\n6.2.1.2. Costs\n\nBy design, making the capital requirements for securitisation more risk-sensitive will reduce the amount of capital that banks hold against their securitisation exposures in some cases, but the overall level of capitalisation is expected to remain prudent and proportionate to the associated risks. Banks may incur some minor implementation costs from implementing the proposed changes, as they would need to implement limited targeted changes to their existing methods for capital requirements calculation. However, these implementation costs are expected to be lower in comparison to the benefits (i.e. estimated funding cost savings stemming from reduced capital requirements). Overall, as the measures do not propose a fundamental overhaul of the methods that banks use for the calculation of capital, they rather involve an adaptation of existing parameters and make the framework more risk sensitive - the costs will be limited and are not considered as a topic of concern by the banking industry.\n\nChanging the SRT framework may result in implementation costs for supervisors to adapt their supervisory methodologies to the existing framework. However, the SSM, the major EU supervisor which assesses almost all SRT transactions in the EU, already incorporates a number of the proposed requirements in their supervisory assessments and processes, which should significantly mitigate the implementation costs of the proposed changes. Implementation costs may be higher for other supervisors which do not incorporate such requirements in their practice (non-SSM or non-Euro area). On the other hand, improving efficiency of SRT supervisory processes should lead to reduction of the ongoing supervisory costs.\n\nMaking the Framework more robust would necessarily mean that some of the new SRT tests may be stricter for some transactions. Increasing the robustness and solidity of the SRT framework is, however, a necessary condition to accompany the proposed changes in the capital treatment and ensure trust in the securitisation market. The proposed changes should simplify the processes associated with these supervisory assessments, reducing the overall administrative burden for both banks and supervisors.\n\n6.2.1.3. Overall assessment: Effectiveness, efficiency and coherence\u00a0\n\nOption 2.1 is expected to be effective in reducing undue prudential barriers for banks to issue securitisation. It is also expected to increase the risk sensitivity of the framework and economic viability of securitisation as a risk transfer tool. By mitigating some of the key barriers to entry for new EU banks, option 2.1 would make securitisation more accessible to a larger number of banks across the EU.\n\nOverall, it is expected to give rise to a relatively moderate increase in securitisation issuance and investments by banks active in the market, in particular of simple and resilient securitisations. It is also expected to result in the entrance of new banks in the market, in particular medium-sized banks or banks in Member States with no active issuance to date.\n\nThe measures are expected to mainly increase\u00a0the issuance of synthetic securitisations, but to a lesser extent also\u00a0of traditional securitisations that are placed in the market (as these will become less capital and cost intensive), thus providing the bank originators with increased liquidity for lending and increased lending capacity. 64 They are also expected to increase the role of banks as investors in the senior tranches of these placed securitisations.\u00a0This would help strengthen the EU banking system\u2019s ability to provide credit to the economy and to refinance new businesses.\n\nThe measures are also expected to increase the share of securitisations in the banks\u2019 liquidity buffers and increase the diversification of banks\u2019 liquidity buffers.\u00a0\n\nHowever, the intervention itself cannot ensure significant market growth, and the active role of market participants will be crucial as well (as noted above). \u00a0\n\nOverall, measures under option 2.1 would support the development of the securitisation market and increase the competitiveness of the banking sector. However, they are not expected to result in an undercapitalisation of securitisation related risks or to jeopardise financial stability, and hence should maintain prudence and soundness as regards banks\u2019 exposures to securitisation. The guiding principle is that prudential requirements are made more risk-sensitive, which in turn is actually expected to support financial stability (a risk-insensitive one-size-fits-all approach would imply that requirements are either too high or too low, relative to the actual underlying risk). This means that capital requirements will be reduced for transactions which are deemed less risky (i.e. with less risky securitised portfolios which have relatively low risk weights), while capital requirements will be increased for transactions which are deemed more risky (i.e. with more risky securitised portfolios). In addition, the SRT rules for assessing the amounts of risk transferred would be made more thorough and robust and liquidity buffers would be more diversified.\n\nThe proposed targeted changes do not represent a trade-off between the banks\u2019 competitiveness and financial stability, as the changes aim to maintain capital requirements at a prudent level\u00a0and concern a specific and narrow area of prudential regulation only (risk-weighted assets corresponding to EU banks\u2019 securitisations currently represent only 1.5% of the EU banks\u2019 total risk-weighted assets). The proposed changes reduce the capital surcharge for securitisations, taking into account that securitisations have suffered very low losses and defaults in the last decades, and that a number of important risk mitigants have been introduced in the EU regulatory and supervisory framework. The EBA\u2019s advice has been taken on board in designing the measures, and the concerns as regards potential undercapitalisation have been taken into account in the design and calibration of the individual measures proposed.\n\nIt should be acknowledged that financial stability risks cannot be reliably quantified, and that there is no precise level of capital requirements below which financial stability is jeopardised and above which financial stability is safeguarded. At the same time, all in all, making prudential requirements more risk-sensitive should promote financial stability.\n\nWith respect to the risk weight floor, specifically, increasing the risk sensitivity of the existing capital framework through targeted reductions to the risk weight floors has been a central recommendation by the EBA. In their analysis, the EBA fully acknowledged the reduced model and agency risk associated with some types of transactions (i.e. tranches retained by originators) and proposed that the reduced risks should be recognised through lower risk weigh floors for these types of transactions, when accompanied by a set of safeguards ensuring their resilience. Option 2.1 goes further and introduces a new risk-sensitive formula for the calculation of the risk weight floor, extends the scope of the reduction of the risk weight floors to other specific types of securitisations, which also have reduced model and agency risks (such as STS securitisations) and adjusts the safeguards to make them more workable for the existing securitisation market.\n\nWith respect to the (p) factor, the EBA has not recommended to reduce the (p) factor, as this could lead to cliff effects (i.e. situation where small changes in the (p) factor result in large changes in the capital requirements and steep differences between capital requirements for different tranches) - due to the intrinsic nature and limitations of the existing formulas for the calculation of capital; and as this could result in undercapitalisation of banks\u2019 exposures to mezzanine securitisation tranches in particular. To take these concerns into account, Option 2.1 limits the changes to the (p) factor to specific types of transactions only, where agency and model risks have been reduced by means of a series of regulatory and supervisory measures, also considering the solid credit performance of the EU originated securitisation market. Also, as the reductions of the (p) factor would be minimal, it would limit the cliff effects (i.e. it would limit the risk of excessive differences between the capital requirements for various tranches) and the resulting amount of capital would still be kept at sufficiently prudent levels, including for the mezzanine tranches.\n\nOption 2.1 is coherent with the recent political statements, including by the European Council, which have highlighted the need to take measures to remove issuance and investment barriers in the EU securitisation market and which have called to look at the prudential treatment of securitisation for banks in particular.\n\nWith respect to the aspect of consistency with international standards, it should be noted that all potential changes to the prudential framework would result in a certain level of deviation from the international standards. The measures under option 1 aim to limit these deviations and maintain a high level of international consistency. Given that the materiality of the deviations from the Basel standards would be limited, we believe the proposal under option 2.1. remains largely consistent and coherent. The proposals have a targeted scope, aim to ensure a positive impact on the EU securitisation market going forward, and to support the international competitiveness of EU banks.\n\nThe proposed targeted changes, when compared to the current provisions, are expected to reduce the capital requirements in particular for less risky, robust and resilient securitisation, but are not expected to give rise to prudential concerns. They aim to correct the current overcapitalisation stemming from the current framework, which is based on best-effort calibrations rather than empirical evidence.\n\n6.2.1.4. Stakeholders\u2019 views\n\nThe targeted amendments towards a more risk-sensitive design of banks\u2019 capital and liquidity requirements (option 2.1) will be welcomed by banks acting as issuers and investors as this proposal will reduce excessive conservatism in the Framework and address some of the main undesired effects. Its targeted nature may be criticised as not being ambitious enough to make the EU securitisation market sufficiently attractive. Banks have been calling for more substantial long-term amendments to revive securitisation activity.\n\nIn the consultation, a significant majority of financial industry representatives considered that the current capital framework gives rise to an undue overcapitalisation of securitisation exposures (33 respondents agree, 0 disagree, 9 have no opinion and 65 provided no answer) and they generally called for comprehensive reductions of the capital parameters. As regards the liquidity framework, a large majority of stakeholders (44 out of 131, 78 did not respond and 9 had no opinion) called for amendments to the eligibility criteria applied to securitisations eligible to the buffer for high quality liquid assets under the LCR.\n\nWith respect to the SRT rules, the respondents generally support regulatory harmonisation of rules and supervisory convergence at the EU level. With respect to the tests applied to securitisations, industry generally agrees with the conditions of the tests and do not see a need to make them more robust, although they are not opposed to targeted changes (23 agree, 19 disagree, 11 have no opinion and 78 do not answer). Supervisors on the other hand believe it is necessary to increase the robustness of the framework, in line with the EBA reports, and support the measures proposed. \u00a0\n\nAs the proposed amendments increase the risk-sensitivity of the Framework, are targeted, take into account the main prudential concerns raised by supervisors as regards the risk from banks\u2019 exposures to securitisation, and do not constitute a major adjustment to the Basel standard, option 2.1 should constitute a pragmatic and balanced proposal.\n\n6.2.2. Option 2.2: Radical overhaul of the existing prudential (capital and liquidity) framework for banks\n\nOption 2.2 entails a radical overhaul of the existing prudential (capital and liquidity) framework, that results in material changes to the way capital requirements are calculated and assessed by supervisors and to the eligibility of securitisations under the liquidity framework. It contains a set of far-reaching yet conceivable policy measures that have been debated between different kinds of stakeholders. It aims to correct an undue bias towards conservativeness and overcapitalisation introduced in the previous framework, which has been detrimental to the banks\u2019 involvement in the securitisation market.\n\nOption 2.2 considers radical changes to three aspects of the framework: the capital framework, the SRT framework and the liquidity framework.\n\nFirst, this option entails a fundamental re-design of the existing capital framework (i.e. the formulas used for the calculation of capital requirements), which would result in completely new methods for the calculation of capital requirements across securitisation tranches. Two alternatives that could be considered are the replacement of the current risk weight design with an \u2019inverted S-curve\u2019 function, and the introduction of a\u00a0scaling parameter to scale the KA downwards, as also analysed by the EBA. 65 \u00a0\n\nSecond, option 2.2 also removes the existing core legal requirements for the significant risk transfer, notably the existing quantitative criteria/tests for achievement of capital relief, and the requirements for supervisory checks and approvals. Option 2.2 effectively results in banks self-assessing their securitisation transactions, based on high-level requirements specified in the legal text, without the need for checks by the supervisors.\n\nFinally, option 2.2 introduces comprehensive changes to the current liquidity requirements for banks in the LCR Delegated Act, resulting in a significant relaxation of the existing eligibility requirements for securitisations to be included in the LCR liquidity buffers, which would substantially extend the scope of eligible securitisations in HQLA beyond STS traditional securitisations (such as, the extension of the eligibility to non-STS securitisations).\n\n6.2.2.1. Benefits\n\nAs noted by the ESAs, the securitisation capital framework should ideally aim to achieve three goals -limit cliff effects, avoid an unreasonable level of capital non-neutrality, and ensure a maximum capitalisation of the junior (most risky) tranches. The structural limitations of the existing securitisation capital framework however only allow to achieve two out of these three goals and generally fails to achieve sufficient risk sensitivity. Therefore, option 2.2 provides an opportunity to reassess the importance and prioritisation of the goals of the existing framework, including the prominence of the role of the (p) factor. The redesign of the current securitisation capital framework thus has a potential to achieve more proportionate levels of capital non-neutrality, mitigate the cliff effects (and therefore mitigate the risks of the undercapitalisation of mezzanine tranches) and introduce more risk sensitivity in the calculation of capital for securitisation.\n\nWith respect to the changes to the SRT framework, option 2.2 would introduce a new approach to the way how transactions are assessed for the purpose of capital relief and would introduce a significantly higher level of flexibility in the existing framework. Significant simplification of the existing framework would help stimulate the issuance of securitisation, as it would reduce the burden on both banks and supervisors. The current SRT framework is highly comprehensive, setting out a number of specific quantitative and qualitative criteria, extending beyond the international Basel requirements. This option would allow to make the SRT framework more comparable with those of some other jurisdictions, where SRT requirements are much more lenient.\n\nWith respect to the LCR changes, relaxing the eligibility conditions to the liquidity buffer to non-STS securitisations would contribute to an increased demand for non-STS securitisations by banks to be included in their liquidity buffers, and as such could help address one of the main issues of the current securitisation market which is the lack of investors in the senior tranches. It would improve market liquidity and volumes and contribute to the diversification of banks\u2019 liquidity buffers. A number of respondents to the targeted consultation have called for the extension of the scope of the LCR to non-STS securitisations, as considered under this option.\n\n6.2.2.2. Costs\n\nThis option would lower the external coherence of the Securitisation Framework since it would entail significant deviations from the existing Basel standards. The ESAs acknowledged that one could in principle look for an alternative design of the existing framework, but that this should be done and agreed preferably at the Basel table. All in all, a potential fundamental redesign of the capital framework is more of a medium-term to long-term project.\n\nLoosening the SRT framework as proposed in option 2.2 could result in further divergence and incoherence in the application of the SRT rules across banks, or even for similar transactions of the same bank. It could lead to higher heterogeneity of SRT outcomes and could increase uncertainty in the market. It could overall reduce the safety and soundness of the capital positions of the banks, and hence negatively impact financial stability.\n\nSimilarly, the changes to the LCR rules could impact the quality of the banks\u2019 liquidity buffers, as it would also include securitisation transactions not meeting the quality criteria of the STS label. A liquidity buffer of lower quality may lead banks to face more difficulties to sell or exchange their liquid assets. This may also oblige banks to accept significant haircuts on their liquid assets in stressed environments. This would mitigate their capacity to refinance their needs on capital markets.\n\n6.2.2.3. Overall assessment: Effectiveness, efficiency and coherence\n\nFundamentally redesigning the risk weight formulas that underpin the capital framework for securitisation would allow to address the limitations of the existing securitisation capital framework. There is therefore a merit in considering these proposals, which have been analysed by the ESAs and also debated by the stakeholders. However, the reformed framework would diverge significantly from the Basel standards. These considerations could therefore be developed in medium term and brought to the Basel table in due time, as also pointed out by the ESAs.\n\nSome elements of option 2.2 (concretely changes to the SRT framework and LCR framework) would however make the framework less robust and could lead to non-prudent outcomes. They could therefore jeopardise the sound capital and liquidity positions of banks and could pose risks for the financial stability.\n\nIn sum, the overall combined impact of measures under the option 2.2 on the reduction of prudential barriers, increase in securitisation issuance and increase in banks\u2019 competitiveness is expected to be potentially more significant than under option 2.1. However, the potential impact on financial stability is also expected to be more significant. Option 2.2. is also expected to lead to major deviations from international Basel requirements.\n\n6.2.2.4. Stakeholders\u2019 views\n\nA number of respondents in the consultation (20 out of 131 agree, 4 disagree, 23 had no opinion and 84 did not answer) considered that a fundamental redesign of the capital framework merits further consideration, as it has a potential to achieve more proportionate levels of capitalisation and increase the risk sensitivity. However, they generally consider that such proposals require further analysis and should be considered in a longer-term perspective, preferably at international level. Banks would also support the possibility to further diversify their liquidity buffer and appreciate the burden reduction linked to the removal of supervisory checks in terms of risk transfer.\n\nSupervisors support investigating alternative designs of the risk weight formulas, albeit they prefer to do it at international level. Supervisors would also disagree with the removal of core supervisory checks for SRTs and with measures that would negatively impact the quality of the banks\u2019 liquidity buffers and the capital position of banks.\n\n6.2.2.5.

Measures to remove undue prudential costs for insurers\n\nThe three options (Options 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3) considered share similarities, as they all involve revising existing risk factors to calculate capital requirements. As a result, it can be challenging for an external reader to grasp the differences and nuances between the options by examining each one in isolation. Therefore, we have chosen to present a simultaneous assessment and comparison of the options. This approach allows us to highlight how each option contributes to specific costs and benefits while clearly distinguishing and quantifying the extent of these effects. We also avoid extensive repetitions and redundant content. Although the structure is distinct, the dimensions assessed remain consistent with the previous sections.\n\n6.3.1. Comparative impacts of Options 1, 2 and 3\n\nOption 3.1: Removing prudential barriers to investments in all non-STS securitisations;\n\nOption 3.2: Improving risk sensitivity and removing prudential barriers to investments in the safest tranches of non-STS securitisations;\n\nOption 3.3: Overhauling the prudential treatment of securitisations in order to make all securitisation investments relatively more \u2018attractive\u2019 than under current rules.\n\nAll three options considered imply a reduction in the amount of capital that insurers are required to hold when investing in a securitisation. This would make it less costly (capital cost) for insurers to invest in securitisation, thus removing the existing undue prudential disincentives for insurers to invest in the EU securitisation market. The options mainly differ in terms of (1) the type of securitisations that would benefit from lowering of capital charges, (2) the extent of capital relief provided and (3) whether this implies a fundamental change to the way of assessing risks of securitisation positions. The net overall effect of these options varies mainly by degree. Still, one needs to also consider the robustness of the underlying technical rationale for changing the rules when assessing each option. The comparative features of the three options are described in the below table.\n\n\t\n\nOption 1\n\n\t\n\nOption 2\n\n\t\n\nOption 3\n\n\n\n\nEligible securitisations\n\n\t\n\nAll non-STS securitisations\n\n\t\n\nOnly senior non-STS securitisations\n\n\t\n\nAll securitisations (both STS and non-STS)\n\n\n\n\nExtent of capital relief\n\n\t\n\nSimple (moderate) lowering of capital requirements\n\n\t\n\nMore significant lowering of capital requirements\n\n\t\n\nHighest lowering of capital requirements\n\n\n\n\nFundamental change to the way of assessing risks of securitisation positions?\n\n\t\n\nNo - capital requirements would continue to reflect market volatility risk\n\n\t\n\nNo - capital requirements would continue to reflect market volatility risk\n\n\t\n\nYes \u2013 capital requirements would only reflect counterparty default risk, and no longer market volatility\n\nThe impact on stakeholders depends on how insurers will use the capital relief.

Comparative benefits and costs of the three options\n\n6.3.2.1. Benefits\n\nAs explained above, all options have in common a reduction of capital requirements so that it is less costly for insurers to invest in securitisations \u2013 hence removing undue prudential obstacles to investments in securitisations in line with the second specific objective. For this reason, they would all contribute to the general objective of this impact assessment (reviving a safer securitisation market).\n\nThe below table provides a very rough estimate of the potential total capital relief (before assuming any change in their investment behaviours). This would represent the additional capital available for insurers to make new investments (possibly in securitisation). Please note that these Commission calculations are based on a number of simplifying assumptions 66 , which are necessary as the reporting data submitted by insurers to their supervisors (and centralised by EIOPA) is not sufficiently granular.\n\n\t\n\nOption 3.1\n\n\t\n\nOption 3.2\n\n\t\n\nOption 3.3\n\n\n\n\nComparison of scope of eligible investments\n\n\t\n\nIntermediate\n\n(all non-STS)\n\n\t\n\nNarrowest\n\n(only senior non-STS)\n\n\t\n\nLargest\n\n(all securitisations)\n\n\n\n\nTotal impact in terms of capital relief\n\n\t\n\nEUR 4.1 bn\n\n\t\n\nEUR 5.9 bn\n\n\t\n\nEUR 7.1 bn\n\nHowever, each of the three options have a differentiated additional benefit:\n\n-\nOption 3.1: simplicity\n\n-\nOption 3.2: removal of undue incentives for excessive risk taking\n\n-\nOption 3.3: preservation of Solvency II\u2019s ability to be conducive of standardisation around the STS label.\n\nOption 3.1 has the merits of being the simplest to implement. It merely requires changing the actual risk factors applicable to non-STS securitisation. Its implementation boils down to changing seven numbers (factors) set out in Article 178(8) of the SII DA. Although options 3.2 and 3.3 are not overly complex either, they require some additional adjustments to information systems.\n\nOption 3.2 brings the additional benefit of making SII more \u2018risk sensitive\u2019 while avoiding undue incentives for excessive risk taking. As the capital requirements on non-senior non-STS would remain much higher than those applicable to senior non-STS tranches, the enhanced risk sensitivity would also remove undue incentives for risk taking by insurance companies. As such, option 3.2 is the most successful in achieving the second specific objective of this impact assessment, namely \u201cenhancing the prudential framework to better account for actual risks and remove unnecessary prudential costs (\u2026) for insurers when (\u2026) investing in securitisations.\u201d While EIOPA did not express specific comments on Option 3.2, it is our assumption that EIOPA would not challenge the technical rationale underlying such Option, as EIOPA does not deny that senior tranches bear less risks than non-senior ones.\n\nOption 3.3 is the only option which would result in capital relief for both STS and non-STS securitisations. It would therefore ensure that Solvency II remains conducive to greater standardisation around the STS label. By contrast, options 3.1 and 3.2 only focus on improving incentives for non-STS securitisation, which might reduce the relative attractiveness of STS ones.\n\n6.3.2.2. Costs\n\nAll three options would generate limited administrative and compliance costs which would therefore not be the main guiding factor when deciding on the preferred option. The reader can find more detailed information in Annex III and Annex XI, Section B. We can expect the costs to be even lower than under banking rules, as changes to Solvency II under all three options would concern a limited number of values for one single parameter (whereas in the banking rules, several provisions and parameters are affected), and we do not envisage e.g. any meaningful change in IT systems.\n\nNone of the three options would differentiate between different types of non-STS securitisations and would apply the same capital requirements regardless of the underlying asset. This may result in underestimating or overestimating the risks underlying certain forms of non-STS securitisations. In particular, the non-STS category can prove to be very diverse, comprising some very stable and very liquid categories, as well as some other, more complex types of securitisations. Against this background, a general lowering of capital requirements for all non-STS securitisations would result in a deterioration of policyholder protection where a specific insurer would materially increase its investments in the more complex/opaque segments of non-STS securitisations.\n\nThe risk is however more contained in option 3.2, which only reduces capital requirements on the most senior tranches (i.e. those less risky and with higher credit rating). The risk of any of the three options is also dependent on insurers\u2019 behaviours and the level of additional investment risk taken by insurers. If behaviours do not change significantly (i.e. the overall share of investments in insurers\u2019 investment portfolio increases in a moderate manner), the risk discussed would remain moderate (though still higher under option 3.3 than under the two other options). However, options 3.1 and 3.3 have specific downsides which are not applicable to option 3.2:\n\n-\nSpecific downside of options 3.1 and 3.3: remaining incentives for \u2018excessive\u2019 risk taking\n\n-\nSpecific downside of options 3.1 and 3.2: reducing the relative attractiveness of STS securitisation\n\n-\nSpecific downside of option 3.3: lack of robust technical basis and significant incoherence introduced within Solvency II which can harm policyholder protection and financial stability.\n\nNeither option 3.1 nor option 3.3 would differentiate senior from non-senior capital requirements (no improvement to risk sensitivity). This means that all else equal, insurers could still be unduly incentivised to invest in the most junior tranches of securitisations as they would be subject to the same requirements as the more senior tranches while offering prospects of higher returns (but also higher risks). This lack of risk sensitivity would be incoherent with banking rules.\n\nOptions 3.1 and 3.2, by only focusing on non-STS securitisation, would reduce the \u2018prudential attractiveness\u2019 of STS securitisation. However, Option 3.2 implies improving risk sensitivity. As such, it is not expected to \u2018dilute\u2019 the STS label, but simply to ensure that the level of capital requirements on non-STS securitisation is more commensurate to its risk, including by comparison with the risks of STS securitisation.\n\nOption 3.3, which is not backed by any advice or assessment made by EIOPA, would be an overhaul to the current approach of calculating capital requirements:\n\n-\nUnder current rules, securitisation investments are treated in the same manner as government bonds, corporate bonds, loans and covered bonds. More concretely, SII requires insurers to set aside capital to cover the risk of loss in value of their investments (\u2018spread risk\u2019).\n\n-\nWith option 3.3, securitisation investments would no longer be treated like other bonds and loans. Their risk would be assessed by looking exclusively at the risk of default 67 . Such a significant change requires either robust technical basis or sufficient evidence.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the choice to focus on default risk can only be justified if insurers stick to their investments until their maturity (if this is the case, then insurers are not exposed to the risk of losses stemming from the early sale of their investments at a depreciated price). However, while insurers have a long-term business \u2013 in particular in life insurance \u2013 a general assumption of holding to maturity conditions is highly challengeable. In fact, only a very limited share of insurers\u2019 assets is intended to be held to maturity, as evidenced in their accounting and financial disclosures 68 .\n\nIn addition, a preferential capital treatment cannot only be justified by a mere \u2018intention\u2019 to hold an asset to maturity. In terms of policyholder protection, what matters is whether insurers can avoid forced selling of their assets when they are facing stressed market conditions. However, the cuts in capital requirements stemming from option 3.3 would not be conditional to such demonstration. Therefore, option 3.3 does not comply with the current level of prudence of the SII framework 69 .\n\nThirdly,\u00a0option 3.3 would affect policyholder protection the most, by introducing significant internal inconsistency within SII, as securitisation would no longer be treated like other similar fixed income securities (government bonds, corporate bonds, covered bonds) 70 . It would also create significant incoherence with banking rules 71 . option 3.3 would therefore bring additional risks to policyholder protection in comparison with options 3.1 and 3.2, by misrepresenting the actual level of risks to which insurers are exposed on their investments.\n\n6.3.3. Overall assessment: Effectiveness, efficiency and coherence\n\n6.3.3.1. Effectiveness\n\nOption 3.1 is effective in reducing undue prudential disincentives to investments in non-STS securitisations.\n\nOption 3.2 is effective in reducing undue prudential disincentives to investments in senior non-STS securitisations. It also avoids providing \u2018wrong\u2019 incentives of risk taking due to the enhanced risk sensitivity. The capital relief insurers obtain through option 3.2 is higher than under option 3.1, which implies more effectiveness in unleashing their investment capacity.\n\nOption 3.3 is effective in reducing undue prudential disincentives to investments in securitisations \u2013 both STS and non-STS. Because it also concerns STS securitisation, the effectiveness is higher than under options 3.1 and 3.2.\n\nFor all three options, it is unclear whether the released capital would result in more investment in securitisations. The capital relief could instead be used in an opportunistic manner by insurers for higher dividend distributions or share buybacks. The risk is higher for option 3.3. in view of the higher extent of capital relief.\n\n6.3.3.2. Efficiency\n\nOption 3.1 would entail very limited compliance costs for insurers due to the simplicity of the amendments. Such costs are negligible in view of the level of reduction in capital costs. However, it would not improve the risk sensitivity of the Framework nor policyholder protection. In addition, it could generate financial stability risks if the lowering of capital requirements results in a significant increase in investments in the most junior tranches of non-STS securitisation. By improving the \u2018prudential attractiveness\u2019 of non-STS securitisation investments and reducing the discrepancy between non-STS and STS capital requirements, the review might the reduce relative attractiveness of STS securitisations and would not be conducive to greater standardisation around that label. Option 3.1 could actually result in less investments in STS securitisation by insurance companies (which are already quite low as shown in the Evaluation).\n\nOption 3.2 would entail some limited compliance and administrative costs that are negligible in view of the reduced capital costs, though slightly higher than in option 3.1. In addition, option 3.2 avoids the \u2018wrong\u2019 incentives for excessive risk-taking identified in option 3.1. Option 3.2 can also be framed so that it does not hinder the objective of the initial initiative of enhanced standardisation, for instance by ensuring that capital requirements on any non-STS securitisation remain higher than those on STS securitisations (including for non-senior tranches). In other words, under option 3.2, all tranches of STS securitisations would remain prudentially more attractive than non-STS securitisations 72 . For all these reasons, option 3.2 would overall be more efficient than option 3.1.\n\nOption 3.3 would entail some limited compliance and administrative costs that are negligible in view of the reduced capital costs (cost levels being between those in options\u00a03.1 and 3.2). Option 3.3 does not hinder the objective of the initial initiative of enhanced standardisation as capital requirements on STS securitisations would also be reduced. However, the technical justifications supporting this approach are limited and not backed by any EIOPA assessment or advice. The lack of safeguards (requirements or criteria) allowing for such preferential treatments poses risks to policyholder protection that are materially higher than under options\u00a03.1 and 3.2 (though the extent of such higher risks would depend on whether insurers materially increase their investments in securitisations following the implementation of this option). Indeed, the SII framework would no longer measure the risk posed by securitisation in a similar manner as for other fixed income securities with similar features. For all these reasons, option 3.3 would be less efficient than options 3.1 and 3.2 in achieving the second specific objective in view of the associated risks. This is due to the limited technical justifications and the absence of qualitative safeguards. Additionally, it presents significantly higher risks to policyholder protection, as the SII framework would no longer assess the risks associated with corporate bonds and securitisation in a comparable way, despite their similar features 73 .\u00a0\n\n6.3.3.3. Coherence\n\nOption 3.1 neither improves nor deteriorates the internal coherence of SII.\n\nOption 3.2 improves the internal coherence of SII by treating in a \u2018comparable\u2019 manner STS and non-STS securitisations (both of them having differentiated capital requirements for senior and non-senior tranches).\n\nOption 3.3 would result in an incoherent SII framework by considering different risks for asset classes with similar characteristics (spread risk for bonds, default risk for securitisation).\n\n6.3.4. Stakeholders\u2019 views\n\nThere is a general support from industry stakeholders to decrease capital requirements for securitisation. Stakeholders do not address concerns regarding the potential complexity of non-STS products and argue that historical risks of default remain low. However, as explained previously, options 3.1 and 3.2 would still include securitisation in the scope of market volatility risk (volatility in credit spreads), not default risk.\n\nHistorical risks of default do not necessarily imply low volatility over a one-year horizon. Market volatility not only depends on the probability of default but also the cost of a potential increase in risk of the investment (e.g. cost of a rating downgrade). It also depends on the specific context of securitisation, including the type and quality of the assets in the securitised pool, as well as the transparency of the asset (lower transparency can result in more significant \u2018irrational\u2019 market movements).\n\nIn fact, it is the understanding of the Commission services that irrespective of the technical or conceptual rationale supporting changes to insurance rules, the industry would be supportive of the most significant decrease in capital charges applied to the widest scope of securitisations (i.e. both STS and non-STS) hence favouring option 3.3. However, the main objective of these respondents is not to align insurance rules with banking rules (which would imply adopting a very sophisticated set of parameters), but to achieve significant cuts in capital requirements. Preferences between option 3.1 and 3.2 would depend on the investment strategy of each individual insurer: companies investing heavily in non-senior tranches would likely favour option 3.1 rather than option 3.2 (since the latter does not bring any changes to non-senior non-STS investments) whereas others would favour option 3.2 (which results in a more significant cut in risk factors than option 3.1.\n\nBy contrast, the insurance supervisory community, in particular EIOPA, generally does not support a decrease in capital requirements for securitisation. EIOPA claims that its current calibration (which remains the basis for currently applicable rules) remains appropriate. EIOPA does not challenge the principle of improving risk sensitivity by differentiating capital requirements between senior and non-senior tranches of non-STS securitisations (as in option 3.2). The supervisory community, in particular EIOPA, would strongly oppose option 3.3 (reclassification of securitisation in the scope of default risk) in view of the lack of technical robustness of this option, the absence of strict criteria for demonstrating a \u2018hold-to-maturity\u2019 investment behaviour, including under stressed conditions, and the internal incoherence of prudential rules which this option would entail. Finally, EIOPA doubts that targeted lowering of capital requirements would have any impacts on investment behaviours, arguing that securitised assets do not have the features that fit the insurance business model, which often requires strict matching of assets and liabilities. The complexity of the product also makes it less attractive compared to other products which necessitate less intensive due diligence. This line of thought applies to all three options.\n\nAs part of the consultation processes, stakeholders were invited to provide feedback on the impact of any decrease in capital requirements on levels of investments. However, no meaningful feedback was received, highlighting the difficulty for stakeholders to provide clarity or \u2018commit\u2019 to potential changes in investment behaviours stemming from changes in prudential rules.\n\nSummary \u2013 impact on financial stability: Option 3.2 lowers capital requirements for the highest quality tranches of non-STS securitisations. Out of all the options considered for insurance, this is the most beneficial for financial stability since it incentivises insurers to invest in the safest part of the non-STS market. The other options can be considered to provide a relatively lower level of protection of financial stability. Option 3.1 (moderately reducing all non-STS capital requirements) brings comparatively more risks to financial stability, as it benefits also the lower quality tranches. Among the options considered, Option 3.3 is the least conducive to tackling financial stability risks adequately, as risks would not be assessed consistently with other asset classes, and the envisaged revised capital requirement would underestimate the actual risks of securitisation. Finally, in view of currently low levels, even if investments in securitisation were to multiply by five, securitisation would still represent a niche asset class within insurers\u2019 portfolio. Financial stability risks are therefore contained.\n\n6.3.5.

For a more detailed analysis, please see Section 7.2.\n\n7.\nComparison and preferred combination of policy options\n\nIn the Table below we present a comprehensive comparison of the policy options, as they relate to the three problems identified in the Impact Assessment. This analysis assesses each policy option across three key criteria: effectiveness, efficiency, and coherence. Based on the analysis presented, we conclude that the following combination of policy options is the most effective, efficient and coherent: option 1.1, option 2.1 and option 3.2.\n\nSummary comparison of all policy options\n\n\t\n\nEffectiveness\n\n\t\n\nEfficiency\n\n\t\n\nCoherence\n\n\n\n\nMeasures to reduce high operational costs\n\n\n\n\nOption 1.1.

Improving risk sensitivity and removing prudential barriers to investments in the safest tranches of non-STS securitisation\n\n\t\n\nSlightly positive\n\n\t\n\nLimited costs\n\n\t\n\nPositive\n\n\n\n\nOption 3.3. Overhauling the prudential treatment of securitisation in order to make all securitisation investments relatively more \u2018attractive\u2019 than under current rules\n\n\t\n\nPositive\n\n\t\n\nLimited costs, material additional risks to policyholder protection and financial stability\n\n\t\n\nNegative\n\nTo address Problem 1 (high operational costs for issuers and investors), option 1.1 presents the most balanced outcome between reducing undue operational due diligence and disclosure costs while maintaining high levels of market transparency, investor protection and supervisory oversight. Option 1.2 has the potential to achieve higher burden reduction, but it also brings higher risks for market integrity. Addressing the risks associated with option 1.2 would make the application of that option much more challenging from a technical perspective and to a large extent nullify the potential benefit it could bring. For example, ensuring that option 1.2 does not sacrifice market transparency, and thereby the ability of investors to conduct proper risk analysis, would require supervisors to conduct thorough checks on the amount and quality of information that each originator discloses upon issuance \u2013 these checks are automated by the securitisation repositories under option 1.1.\n\nWhen it comes to Problem 2 (undue prudential barriers for banks), option 2.1 is the preferred option, as it addresses miscalibrations in the capital requirements for banks in a more efficient and targeted way, only for robust and resilient transactions for which risks have been reduced. The expected impact and outcome of the policy proposals under option 2.1 is more predictable, and the calibration of the proposal is relatively more straightforward and less complex. It would allow to stimulate banks\u2019 participation in the securitisation market without resulting in significant regulatory deviations from international standards and without jeopardising financial stability. On the other hand, option 2.2 would likely reduce the safety and soundness of the capital positions of banks and negatively impact the quality of banks\u2019 liquidity buffers.\n\nUnder Problem 3 (undue prudential costs for insurers), option 3.2 is the most effective in removing undue prudential disincentives while avoiding undue deterioration of policyholder protection. It would remove undue prudential obstacles to investments in non-STS securitisations by addressing the current very conservative prudential treatment, while removing undue incentives for insurers to invest in the riskiest tranches.\n\nAll three preferred options are complementary, target different aspects of the Securitisation Framework and different players on the securitisation market, hence altogether provide a comprehensive solution to the core problems identified. The three preferred options are also mutually reinforcing; for example, changes in the prudential treatment of securitisation would have a much less pronounced effect on securitisation issuance if implemented on a standalone basis and if not accompanied with the adjustments to the disclosure and due diligence framework.\n\nSolving Problem 1 reinforces the impacts of the measures to address Problems 2 and 3. Solving Problem 3 reinforces the response to Problem 2, to the extent that lack of issuance is driven by insufficient investor demand. The reverse is also true \u2013 having more supply would reinforce the impact of solving Problem 3 to the extent that insufficient supply affects investor demand. Despite their complementarity, the effectiveness of the options to address one problem does not depend on which option is chosen to address another problem. For example, the effectiveness of the measures to lower operational costs does not depend on which option is chosen to address the undue prudential barriers/costs for banks and insurers.\n\nAgainst this background, the assessment concludes that there is no better combination of policy options to meet the stated objectives. Moreover, as explained above, none of the preferred policy options are expected to put financial stability at risk. Therefore, their combination also does not.\n\n7.1. Impact of the preferred policy options on the general objective\n\nOptions 1.1, 2.1, and 3.2 present a compelling opportunity for the EU to revitalise its securitisation market, to allow securitisation to play a role in the development of the SIU and to reduce burden and compliance costs for issuers and investors. By addressing the high operational costs and undue prudential disincentives that have deterred banks and insurers from participating in the EU securitisation market, these options will contribute to the Commission's effort to reduce the regulatory burden on market participants and stimulate the use of securitisation. The pace of growth of the market would, however, depend also on factors outside the regulatory securitisation framework. At the same time, the presented options will continue to safeguard financial stability and provide an adequate level of investor and consumer protection.\n\nTogether, this package of options will directly contribute to the broader effort to establish a Savings and Investment Union. A safe and vibrant securitisation market will provide EU households and businesses with access to the necessary funds to grow and be more competitive, creating new opportunities and driving economic prosperity. Moreover, by increasing the availability of financing, securitisation can contribute to funding the EU's strategic priorities, and its fungible nature means that it can be adapted to fund a wide range of priorities, making it an important tool for financing EU's future growth and development.\n\nWhile the proposed options are expected to drive market development, it is equally important to recognise that market participants also have a role to play in fostering a more robust and dynamic securitisation market. Various external factors, such as the state of monetary policy and the availability of alternative funding sources, will also have an important impact on how the securitisation market develops going forward.\n\n7.2. Social, environmental and fundamental rights impact\n\nThe assessment of the various policy options primarily focuses on their economic and regulatory impacts, with no direct impacts on social, environmental, and fundamental rights issues. However, for all the options assessed indirect effects can be considered in each of these areas:\n\nSocial Impacts\n\nBy enhancing credit availability and facilitating more efficient risk transfer, the proposed measures can indirectly boost economic activity. This can lead to increased lending to businesses, including SMEs, thereby potentially supporting job creation and economic growth. Improved efficiency in the banking sector may lower borrowing costs and enable banks to extend credit to a broader segment of the population. This could enhance access to financial services, promoting social inclusion and helping individuals who are typically underserved by traditional financial systems.\n\nEnvironmental Impacts\n\nWhile the proposed measures do not explicitly target environmental outcomes, a more efficient securitisation market could support green investment initiatives by making capital more accessible for environmentally friendly projects. This could, in turn, help banks to finance sustainable projects, contributing indirectly to positive environmental outcomes. If banks decide to prioritise investments in sustainable assets or projects, the improved liquidity and credit capacity enabled by measures envisaged under this initiative could facilitate increased funding for sustainability. It should be noted that the current framework already provides for voluntary disclosure on the principal adverse impacts of the assets financed by the underlying exposures on sustainability factors for STS securitisation. Moreover, as outlined in detail in the evaluation (see Annex V), the EUGBS Regulation provides for a dedicated framework for green securitisation. The review is not foreseeing any changes in this respect. No negative environmental implications have been identified for any of the policy options. The initiative aligns with the UN Sustainability Development Goal 8.2, which involves achieving higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading, and innovation.\n\nFundamental Rights\n\nThere are no direct impacts on fundamental rights. The simplification and efficiency measures do not directly address issues relating to personal data or privacy. Nonetheless, changes to disclosure and reporting standards must comply with existing data protection laws to ensure the security and privacy of any personal data involved in the securitisation process.\n\nThe preferred combination of options is highlighted as the preferred option due to its effectiveness in reducing high operational costs and removing undue prudential barriers, while avoiding undue deterioration of protection and avoiding incentives for excessive risk-taking. This option aims to balance the need for economic stimulus with maintaining robust standards, thus minimising negative societal impacts. Overall, while the proposed measures mainly focus on financial regulation, there are potential indirect benefits that can arise, impacting social, environmental, and fundamental rights in supportive and sustainable ways. Ensuring a stable securitisation market contributes indirectly to the protection of fundamental economic rights by promoting financial stability through risk diversification.\n\n7.3. REFIT (simplification and improved efficiency)\n\nThe presented policy options propose series of simplifications and refinements to enhance efficiency within the securitisation market. Through targeted adjustments and strategic simplification, these measures are positioned to bolster the market's capacity, attract a broader base of investors, and encourage economic growth\u2014while maintaining a resilient and transparent financial ecosystem. The changes are expected to boost the competitiveness and sustainability of the EU Securitisation Framework, driving growth for all stakeholders involved.\n\nBy reducing compliance overhead for issuers and aligning regulatory measures with actual market practices, the reform seeks to invigorate market participation, transparency, and risk management. Ultimately, these changes address unnecessary prudential and operational costs, strengthening the market structure and its resilience for future growth.\n\nThe preferred option embeds a significant simplification of due diligence duties for businesses and a more efficient transparency framework. This would involve a streamlining of the processes companies need to follow to ensure compliance. By reducing these obligations, businesses will face lower compliance costs, enabling more resources to be allocated to core business activities.\n\nImplementation costs are expected to be offset by long-term operational savings. While issuers may encounter some one-off costs to adapt to the revised reporting type under Article 7 SECR, the recurrent reduction in administrative burdens should outweigh these initial expenditures. By mandating that both public and private securitisation transactions report to repositories, the preferred option enhances market transparency.\n\n7.4. Application of the \u2018one in, one out\u2019 approach\n\nThe operational costs linked to the due diligence and transparency obligations under the SECR can be categorised as administrative costs relevant for the \u201cone in, one out\u201d offsetting:\n\n\u00b7\nThe preferred option would lead to an estimated saving of total recurring administrative costs in the approximate magnitude of EUR 310\u00a0million per year.\n\n\u00b7\nMeanwhile, it is expected that the preferred option will entail moderate\u00a0one-off administrative costs\u00a0for the implementation of amended reporting templates\u00a0estimated to EUR 33 million\u00a0subject to one in, one out considerations as the preferred approach intends lightening the existing due diligence and transparency requirements.\n\nFurther detail is available in Annex III.\n\n7.5. Impact on SMEs\n\nThe preferred options would have mostly indirect, but positive, impacts on SMEs. Although SMEs are generally not directly involved in the EU securitisation market as issuers or investors, the initiative would increase banks' lending capacity and improve SMEs' access to cheaper and more diversified funding sources. Measures to simplify regulations and lower operational costs could encourage broader securitisation, including of SME loans, and promote competition through the entry of new lenders. The increased risk sensitivity of the banks\u2019 capital framework would allow to achieve a more favourable capital treatment of SME loans (for example, the introduction of the risk sensitive risk weight floor for the senior tranches would allow to reflect the SME supporting factor in the securitisation capital treatment, which is not possible under the current framework). This could encourage the securitisations of the SME loans. While a limited number of stakeholders cited concerns regarding SME over-reliance on bank-based funding, the initiative is generally seen as supportive of SME financing, with no significant negative impacts identified.\n\nFurther detail is available in Annex VIII.\n\n7.6. Impact on EU Competitiveness\n\nThe preferred option would strengthen EU competitiveness by reducing capital and compliance costs for securitisation market participants, thereby improving cost efficiency and aligning the EU framework more closely with international standards. This will help level the playing field for EU issuers and investors, who currently face higher operational burdens compared to non-EU counterparts. By simplifying due diligence and transparency, and making prudential requirements more risk-sensitive, the initiative enhances the attractiveness of EU securitisation products both domestically and globally. Increased securitisation activity can also free up lending capacity for banks and credit institutions, supporting greater access to finance for EU businesses, including SMEs. This is particularly relevant for advancing the EU\u2019s strategic goals in green and digital innovation, where improved financing channels are critical to maintaining global competitiveness.\n\nFurther detail is available in Annex VII.\n\n8.\nHow will actual impacts be monitored and evaluated?\n\nThe Commission shall carry out an evaluation of this package of proposed amendments, four years after its entry into application and present a report on the main findings to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee. The evaluation shall be conducted according to the Commission's Better Regulation Guidelines. The evaluation will be based on a list of specific and measurable indicators that are relevant to the objective of the reform, as presented in the following table. To prepare the evaluation report, the Commission will mandate Member States, the ESAs and the ECB/SSM to collect data to calculate the indicators included in the table and report on them to the Commission.\n\nObjective\n\n\t\n\nIndicator\n\n\t\n\nSource of information\n\n\n\n\nReducing undue prudential barriers for banks\n\n\t\n\nThe Commission shall assess the overall situation and dynamics of the EU securitisation market and the appropriateness and effectiveness of the EU prudential securitisation framework (differentiating between different types of securitisations, including synthetic and traditional securitisations, between originators and investors, and between STS and non-STS transactions). It will also assess the increase in the number of banks involved in securitisation, the increase in the volume of traditional securitisations placed with external investors (i.e. not retained) and the increase of the volume of securitisation positions in the banks\u2019 liquidity buffers.\n\nAs part of the review, the Commission shall also assess the impact of the amendments on financial stability. It shall also consider whether a more fundamental change to the risk-weight formulas and functions would allow to achieve more risk sensitivity and address structural limitations of the current framework.\n\n\t\n\nEBA, ESMA, ECB/SSM\n\n\n\n\nReducing operational costs to issue and invest in securitisation in the EU\n\n\t\n\nMonitoring the cost of conducting due diligence to invest in securitisation transactions.\n\nMonitoring issuance cost stemming from the disclosure requirements.\n\nTracking the number of securitisation issuers and investors\n\n\t\n\nSurveys among market practitioners\n\n\n\n\nReducing undue prudential costs for insurers\n\n\t\n\nIncrease in the total reported amounts of investments in securitisations by insurers would demonstrate the positive effect of the reforms on insurers\u2019 decisions to ramp up their investments in securitisation.\n\n\t\n\nEIOPA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnex I: Procedural information (still under development)\n\n1 - Lead DG, Decide Planning/CWP references\n\nThis Impact Assessment Report was prepared by Directorate A \u201cGeneral Affairs\u201d, and Directorate D \u201cBanking, Insurance & Financial Crime\u201d, of the Directorate-General for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union (DG FISMA).\n\nThe Decide Planning references are: PLAN/2024/1808; PLAN/2024/1929; PLAN/2024/2001.\n\nThe initiative was included in the Commission Work Programme 2025.\n\n2 - Organisation and timing\n\nThe first ISSG took place on 23 January 2025 with the attendance of the following Directorates-General (DGs) of the European Commission: Economic and Financial Affairs, Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs; Budget; Education, Youth, Sport and Culture; Reform and Investment Task Force; Regional and Urban Policy; Research and Innovation; Justice and Consumers; Trade; Competition; Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion; Taxation and Customs Union; Trade and Economic Security; Environment; Taxation and Customs Union; Eurostat; Joint Research Centre; Secretariat General; Energy; and Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union. The second ISSG meeting took place on 21 February 2025.\n\nDG FISMA has considered the comments made by DGs in the final version of the impact assessment. In particular, DG FISMA has provided more clarity about the seriousness of the problems, the impacts of the various options, as well as further evidencing the various claims and statements made throughout the text. DG FISMA provided bilateral feedback on certain comments to provide additional background, explanation and reassurance to colleagues, particularly on comments and issues that fell outside the remit of the current initiative. The analysis of impacts and the preferred option takes account of the views and input of different DGs.\n\n3 - Consultation of the RSB\n\nAn upstream meeting was held with the Regulatory Scrutiny Board (RSB) on 25 November 2024.\n\nThe draft report was sent to the RSB on 12 March 2025 and the hearing took place on 9 April 2025. The RSB issued a positive opinion with reservations on 11 April 2025 74 . The principal reservations (which have been addressed in this final version of the report) were the following:\n\n(1) The report does not sufficiently substantiate the problem and its drivers. It does not clearly identify the evidence driving the conclusion that over-restrictive prudential, due diligence and transparency requirements act as a barrier to the development of the market.\n\n(2) The report does not adequately define the key elements for each of the assessed options. It is unclear what is supposed to change in the prudential framework and due diligence and transparency rules. The report does not therefore clearly bring out the choices and trade-offs made when developing the options.\n\n(3) The report does not adequately assess and compare the combined impacts of the options in terms of how they could affect the stability of the financial system. The report is also not sufficiently clear on whether the different options presented imply different risk levels for the financial system.\n\n\u00b7\nReports were introduced in Annex 2 of two further consultation events held subsequent to the submission of the draft report to the RSB \u2013 the closure of the Call for Evidence (stakeholders), and the Commission Expert Group on Banking Payments and Insurance (Member States).\n\nIssue identified by the Board\n\n\t\n\nAction taken\n\n\n\n\nThe report does not sufficiently substantiate the problem and its drivers. It does not clearly identify the evidence driving the conclusion that over-restrictive prudential, due diligence and transparency requirements act as a barrier to the development of the market.\n\n\t\n\nAdditional evidence with regard to the role of external factors has been added in section 2.1. Explanation was added in section 2.1.2. to demonstrate why the current disclosure and due diligence requirements go beyond what is necessary, thus hindering market development. In addition, explanation has been added to further substantiate the problem regarding the prudential treatment of banks. In addition, key findings from the Evaluation were highlighted in the text of the Impact Assessment to better illustrate all three identified problems and their drivers (see sections 2.1.2, 2.1.3., and 2.1.4.). Stakeholders\u2019 feedback has been amended to more systematically outline the views of different stakeholder groups.\n\n\n\n\nThe report does not adequately define the key elements for each of the assessed options. It is unclear what is supposed to change in the prudential framework and due diligence and transparency rules. The report does not therefore clearly bring out the choices and trade-offs made when developing the options.\n\n\t\n\nFurther detail has been added to explain the changes that the different options entail for transparency, due diligence and prudential requirements (see sections 5.2.1, 5.2.2, and 5.2.3). Such clarifications aim to clearly bring out the choices and trade-offs made when developing the options.\n\n\n\n\nThe report does not adequately assess and compare the combined impacts of the options in terms of how they could affect the stability of the financial system. The report is also not sufficiently clear on whether the different options presented imply different risk levels for the financial system.\n\n\t\n\nIn general, additional detail has been added to explain that none of the presented options are expected to endanger financial stability, and therefore neither does their combination (see section 6).\n\nThe section on the prudential treatment of banks has been amended to provide further details on the content of the proposed measures, on the expected impact of the stability of the financial system and on the costs related with the implementation of the proposals.\n\n4 - Evidence, sources and quality\n\nThe impact assessment drew on a broad range of information sources such as the results of consultations with stakeholders, reports from the ESAs, and additional desk research by the Commission services. Some of the specific sources of data used in the preparation of this impact assessment include the following:\n\n\u00b7\nEvidence supplied in the context of various consultations by the Commission as described in Annex II;\u00a0\n\n\u00b7\nEIOPA data extracted from quantitative reporting templates submitted by insurance and reinsurance undertakings;\n\n\u00b7\nECB Governing Council Statement of 7 March 2024; 75\n\n\u00b7\nEurogroup Statement of 11 March 2024; 76\n\n\u00b7\nEuropean Council conclusions of April 77 , June 2024; 78\n\n\u00b7\n\u201cMuch more than a market\u201d, report by Enrico Letta, 17 April 2024; 79\n\n\u00b7\n\u201cThe future of European competitiveness,\u201d report by Mario Draghi, 9 September 2024; 80\n\n\u00b7\nEBA working papers and staff working documents;\n\n\u00b7\nPublicly available studies, reports, position papers and other relevant documents drawn up by private and public stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnex II: Stakeholders\u2019 consultation (Synopsis report)\n\nIn order to ensure that the Commission\u2019s proposal adequately takes into account the views of all interested stakeholders, the consultation strategy supporting this initiative was built on the following components:\n\n\u00b7\nA targeted (but nevertheless public and open) consultation, with detailed questions aimed specifically towards market participants with expertise in the European securitisation market, open from 9 October 2024 to 4 December 2024; 81\n\n\u00b7\nNumerous ad hoc bilateral contacts with various stakeholders, either on their initiative or that of the Commission.\n\n\u00b7\nConsultation of stakeholders in a dedicated day-long in-person Securitisation workshop, held on Commission premises in Brussels on 3 July 2024;\n\n\u00b7\nInput from the European Supervisory Authorities within the framework of the Joint Committee Securitisation Committee and of the European Systemic Risk Board;\n\n\u00b7\nConsultation of Member States\u2019 experts through (the Financial Services Committee and Eurogroup Working Group +)\n\n\u00b7\nCall for Evidence published on 19 February 2025 and running until 26 March 2025.\n\n1 - Targeted Consultation\n\nGiven the technical nature of the initiative, a decision was taken to conduct a targeted public consultation to obtain stakeholder views on the functioning of the EU securitisation framework. The 8-week feedback period ran from 9 October 2024 to 4 December 2024. The consultation, which was conducted online via the EUSurvey platform, received 133 responses from a variety of stakeholders. 131 replies were submitted via the online form, and 2 were sent by email to a dedicated functional email inbox, managed by DG FISMA. Please note that unless specifically mentioned in the summary of the online consultation, the two email respondents were not considered in the statistical analysis of answers.\n\nMost respondents were stakeholders from the European Economic Area (107), in addition to the US (13), UK (10) and Switzerland (2), Australia (1). Please note that unless specifically specified in the summary of the online consultation, those who did not provide a view were not considered in the analysis of answers. Responses received were from a variety of stakeholders representing individual companies, business associations, public authorities, consumer organisations, EU citizens, NGOs, trade unions and academic/research institutions.\n\nBelow is a summary of the views expressed in the targeted consultation with regard to the experience with the framework so far and to further action to improve the framework and develop the EU securitisation market. The summary is presented thematically by issue area. Any opinions expressed reflect the views of the respondents and do not reflect the position of the European Commission.\n\n1.1. Non-prudential issues\n\n1.1.2. Effectiveness of the securitisation framework\n\nThe following chart presents the replies to the question: \u201cDo you agree that the securitisation framework (...) has been successful in, or has contributed to, achieving the following objectives. For clearer presentation, respondents that did not answer the question have been omitted from the graph.\n\n1.1.3. Impact on SMEs\n\nThe majority of respondents identified SMEs as having only limited access to securitisation. More than one third of the respondents (51 out of 131, 72 gave no answer or provided no opinion) reported having come across impediments to securitise SME loans or invest in SME securitisation (8 had not, 72 gave no answer or didn\u2019t know). They highlighted regulatory complexity, high costs, and lack of data quality as major impediments to securitising SME loans. Insufficient reliable financial data hinders risk evaluation and investor interest \u2013 relatedly, stringent due diligence requirements are burdensome and complicated, particularly with limited SME information. Unfavourable prudential treatment of securitised loans, including higher capital requirements under the Basel III framework, are highlighted as discouraging investments in SME securitisation. As such, the existing regulatory framework struggles to offer attractive access to financing options for SMEs via securitisation.\n\nSome respondents from the industry see the potential for securitisation to facilitate SMEs' access to capital markets by providing them with a wider range of financing options and increasing their access to credit. In order for securitisation to support access to finance for SMEs, many respondent banks and banking associations stated that the regulatory framework for securitisation should be simplified and made more proportionate to make it more effective. In particular, transparency and investor due diligence requirements should be more proportionate and therefore less burdensome, and transparency and disclosure requirements should be improved.\n\nOn the other hand, consumer organisations point out that it is unrealistic that securitisation would contribute to SME financing. Consumer organisations also caution that promoting securitisation could entrench the dependence on bank financing and potentially disrupt covered bond markets. They suggest that instead of simplifying the securitisation framework, the EU should expand existing programs, such as those offered by the EIF and EIB.\n\n1.1.4. Scope of application of the Securitisation Regulation (SECR)\n\nOpinions were mixed amongst respondents on whether clarification was needed on the jurisdictional scope of the SECR, to establish a clearer and more consistent framework for supervising and regulating securitisations that involve non-EU entities. On the question of the need to clarify the SECR\u2019s jurisdictional scope, 28 out of 131 respondents agreed, 32 disagreed, 24 had no opinion and 47 did not respond. Many recommend the recent UK reforms, as striking the right balance between ensuring regulatory consistency and avoiding unnecessary burdens, by allowing investors to collect the information and data they need without being forced to comply with prescriptive requirements.\n\nIn contrast, other banks and trade associations argue that the scope of application is well understood and settled satisfactorily. They suggest that any changes should focus on revising the ESMA template for third-country securitisation to ensure that institutional investors can obtain appropriate disclosure. Some also suggest that the EU should clarify the allocation of supervisory competence between national authorities.\n\nOn changing the definition of securitisation, opponents cited uncertainty and regulatory complexity that might stem from such a move, and that the existing market definition was well-understood. A few suggest harmonising it with the US definition of \"asset-backed security\u201d, which many EU market participants are also familiar with. Broadening the scope is recommended by some who believe the current definition does not capture transactions that are structured so as to fall outside the SECR\u2019s technical scope but fulfil the same economic purpose. Conversely, respondents in favour of narrowing the definition claim its current breadth and vagueness have made market participants reluctant to participate in transactions that fall within a regulatory \"grey area\u201d.\n\nApproximately half of those responding to this section advocated for the definition of a sponsor to be expanded to include alternative investment fund managers (AIFMs) established in the EU. The other half opposed considered that AIFMs are not set up to retain a 5% share in a securitisation transaction and such risk retention practices could give rise to possible conflicts of interest.\n\n1.1.5. Due diligence requirements\n\nMost respondents (84 out of 131) believe that the due diligence requirements set forth in the SECR should be reformed to be more principle-based, proportionate, and less burdensome. This sentiment stems from the notion that the current requirements are disproportionate to the risks associated with securitisations. They suggest that less stringent due diligence requirements should be applied to well-rated senior tranches. Should the Commission consider making due diligence requirements more risk-sensitive, respondents emphasize that such an approach should not result in overly prescriptive requirements, as relevant factors will vary on a case-by-case basis.\n\nMost market participants propose the removal of verification requirements for investors that are already checked by supervisors, including compliance with the STS (Simple, Transparent, and Standardised) criteria. However, supervisors are hesitant to abolish these requirements, particularly the need for investors to verify that the originator adheres to the disclosure requirements under SECR.\n\nSome respondents even advocate for the complete elimination of due diligence requirements for securitisations, opting to rely solely on sector-specific legislations as is the case for other investments. The consensus among respondents is that the current due diligence requirements discourage investment in the secondary market and repeat securitisations. Regarding delegation of due diligence, stakeholders have different interpretations about the applicable sanctions for non-compliance with Article 5.\n\n1.1.6. Transparency requirements\n\nThe majority of respondents (56 out of 131, 57 did not respond and 4 had no opinion) find that disclosure when issuing a securitisation is significantly more costly than disclosure for other instruments with similar risk characteristics due to the complexity, level of detail and vast scope of the disclosure requirements.\n\nTo lower compliance costs while still ensuring a high level of transparency, the majority of respondents opted for streamlining the current disclosure templates for public securitisations and introducing a simplified template for private securitisations. However, many industry respondents advise against requiring private securitisations to report to securitisation repositories due to the associated increase in compliance costs. To further reduce compliance costs, stakeholders are in favour of cautiously moving away from the current requirement for loan-level disclosure for all securitisations.\n\n1.1.7. Supervision\n\nThe responses (56 out of 131, 67 did not respond and 8 had no opinion) highlight widespread challenges in the EU's securitisation supervision framework. Key issues include inconsistent supervisory practices among National Competent Authorities (NCAs), leading to divergent interpretations of rules, overlapping reporting requirements, and application of criteria for Significant Risk Transfer (SRT) and STS securitisations. Concerns also stem from the treatment of non-binding recommendations, such as the EBA's 2020 SRT report, being applied as de facto mandatory requirements, exacerbating regulatory uncertainty. Harmonisation is further hindered by differences in collateral eligibility assessments.\n\nStakeholders propose enhanced coordination between European and national supervisors. The majority of the respondents that replied to the supervision related questions suggest setting up supervisory hubs, to a lesser extent they support the idea of having one national authority as lead coordinator in the case of one issuance involving multiple supervisors or a single supervisor.\n\nOn the added value of Third-party verifiers (TPVs) in the STS market, the vast majority of respondents (55 out of 131, 67 did not respond and 9 had no opinion) highlight their importance. Only 43 of the 131 survey participants responded on whether TPVs should be supervised: the majority of these (28 replies), including some public authorities, a suggest that supervision of TPVs is necessary to ensure the integrity of the STS standard and to promote investor confidence. However, to provide more meaningful input, most respondents highlight that more information is needed to accurately estimate the potential costs and benefits of supervision.\n\n1.1.8. STS standard\n\nMost respondents (65 out of 131, 46 did not respond and 7 had no opinion) think that the current STS label does not have the potential to significantly scale up the market. This sentiment is shared by many stakeholders, who argue that to achieve success with STS, the criteria must be simplified, and the prudential framework should be reformed.\n\nCritics of the current STS criteria point to two main issues: i) homogeneity criteria, which they believe are a significant obstacle for certain transactions, such as infrastructure financing transactions and SME portfolios, and ii) the list of eligible collateral arrangements for on-balance-sheet STS securitisations. Furthermore, smaller banks face additional challenges in meeting these criteria due to their limited portfolios, making it even more difficult for them to participate in the market. Many respondents highlighted the complexity of the STS regime in general.\n\nIn addition to addressing the STS criteria, many respondents also emphasize the need for reforms in the non-STS market. They argue that relying on a targeted approach to specific segments of the market will not be sufficient to attract the necessary investment. This is because such an approach will not provide investors with the critical mass required to invest in the market.\n\n1.1.9. Securitisation Platform\n\n41 out of 131 respondents agree that a securitisation platform or platforms could increase the use and attractiveness of securitisation in the EU (18 disagreed, 51 did not respond and 21 had no opinion). Those in agreement viewed the objective of the securitisation platform as to facilitate standardisation, lower issuance cost and funding cost for the economy, promote better integration of cross border securitisation, and enhance transparency and due diligence.\n\n22 respondents agreed that a securitisation platform should target a specific asset class, like green loans (6 respondents), mortgages (6 respondents), or SME loans (6 respondents). 12 did not agree that a future platform should target a specific asset class, (74 did not respond, 23 had no opinion). 21 respondents disagree that guarantees are necessary for such platform to function, while 18 agreed to the necessity of guarantees (67 did not answer, 25 had no opinion). The majority of respondents favourable to a guarantee would opt for a public guarantee provided by the EU or dedicated EU agency (like EIB or EIF). Due to potential systemic risks respondents do not believe that a private guarantee to a pan-European platform would be appropriate.\n\nRespondents identified several challenges associated with the introduction of such a platform, like fragmented legal framework (differences in insolvency laws, contract law, and securitisation practices across EU Member States), lack of standardisation in loan contracts, securitisation structures, and eligibility criteria across jurisdictions complicates asset pooling and investor confidence. Competition with existing instruments like covered bonds could also potentially limit the platform's utility. The high development and upkeep costs, as well as costs related to pricing and valuation disparities for assets from different jurisdictions, were also cited as a challenge. Lastly, concerns about the political will to implement a unified system and debates about risk-sharing among Member States would also have to be addressed.\n\nAt the same time, nearly all the respondents agree that creation of securitisation platform is not the main issue in the market, and it should be addressed at a later stage, following comprehensive feasibility studies and consultations. Quite a few suggested to focus on improving existing schemes, such as EIB/EIF securitisation programmes.\n\n1.2. Prudential and liquidity risk treatment of securitisation for banks\n\n1.2.1. General comments\n\nA substantial majority of financial industry representatives consider that the current capital framework based on non-neutrality of capital requirements 82 leads to undue overcapitalisation of the securitisation exposures (33 respondents agree, 0 disagree, 9 have no opinion and 65 provided no answer), and consider that reducing such non-neutrality would stimulate banks\u2019 involvement in the securitisation market, while at the same time keeping the capitalisation of securitisations at a sufficiently prudent level (36 agree, 0 disagree, 8 no opinion, 63 did not answer).\n\nThe level of capital non-neutrality is considered disproportionately high relative to the current lower levels of agency and model risks embedded in securitisations, which have been significantly reduced following the financial crisis, by means of several supervisory and regulatory initiatives.\n\nTo reduce the non-neutrality, the respondents call for comprehensive reductions of two main capital parameters (the (p) factor being the main parameter driving the non-neutrality of securitisation capital, and the risk weight floors setting out the minimum capital levels for the senior tranches) - arguing the capital reductions should be applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all types of banks i.e. originators, sponsors and investors, all capital approaches and all types of securitisations (STS and non-STS). With respect to the public authorities, they raised concerns with the reductions of the (p) factor in particular against the high risk of undercapitalisation of some (in particular mezzanine) tranches.\n\nA number of respondents (20 out of 131 agree, 4 disagree, 23 had no opinion and 84 did not answer) consider that an alternative design, involving a fundamental redesign of the capital framework merits further consideration as it has a potential to achieve more proportionate levels of capitalisation. However, they generally consider that such proposals require further analysis and should be considered in the long-term, preferably at international (Basel) level.\n\n1.2.2 (P) factor\n\nSupervisors have been cautious as regard the reduction of the (p) factor (out of 9 supervisors, 2 supervisors consider that the current levels of the (p) factor adequately address structural risks of securitisation, 1 is against, 1 has no opinion and 5 did not answers). In their qualitative responses, they argue that reducing the (p) factor risks undercapitalisation of mezzanine (and potentially senior) tranches and will not have any relevant effect on freeing capital and on securitisation issuance. Supervisors acknowledge the limitations of any unilateral reductions of the (p) factor and agree with the existence of limitations embedded in the current regulatory framework. They support investigating the alternative designs of the risk weight functions, at an international level.\n\n1.2.3 Risk weight floors\n\nA significant majority of active respondents (yes 42, no 7, no opinion 7, no answer 75) call for a comprehensive reduction of the risk weight (RW) floors, beyond those proposed by the EBA. Most respondents favour reduction of the risk weight floor for banks in all roles in securitisation, while a minority advocate for a more restrictive treatment of investors due to their having less information on the transaction. Similarly, a number of respondents view that a reduction of the risk weight floor only for STS transactions would be insufficient to revive the European securitisation market. Respondents however generally agree with distinct STS and non-STS risk weight floors.\n\nA large majority of active respondents do not consider that safeguards proposed by EBA to accompany the reduction of the risk weight floors and to ensure the resilience of the transactions are proportionate or adequate (36 do not agree, 4 agree, 11 have no opinion, 80 did not answer).\n\nA large group of respondents argue for a risk sensitive approach to setting the risk weight floors, so that it is proportional to the risk of the underlying portfolio. Supervisors are more reluctant to change the floors without sufficient analysis and do not support a deviation from Basel.\n\n1.2.4. Framework for significant risk transfer (SRT)\n\nWith respect to the Significant Risk Transfer rules, the respondents generally support regulatory harmonisation of rules and supervisory convergence at the EU level. With respect to the tests applied to securitisations, industry generally agree with the conditions of the tests and do not see a need to make them more robust, although they are not opposed to it (23 agree, 19 disagree, 11 have no opinion and 78 do not answer). Public authorities on the other hand see necessity to increase the robustness of the framework, in line with the EBA reports.\n\nWith respect to the process of the SRT supervisory assessments, the financial industry and several public authorities noted that the SRT process suffers from a lack of supervisory convergence and regulatory clarity, which makes both its timings and outcomes unpredictable.\n\n1.2.5. Liquidity treatment in the LCR\n\nOn liquidity risk requirements for banks, a large majority of stakeholders (44 out of 131, 78 didn\u2019t respond and 9 had no opinion) call for amendments to the eligibility criteria and haircut levels applied to securitisations eligible to the buffer for high quality liquid assets under the LCR. Some of these changes are aligned with the recommendations received from the ESAs and compatible with the Basel framework. A couple of respondents consider there is not enough track record and data on the liquidity of securitisations under stress to significantly relax their eligibility to the liquidity buffer.\n\n1.3. The prudential treatment of securitisation for insurers\n\n1.3.1. Interest in and obstacles for securitisation investment\n\nThe majority of financial institutions and trade associations (47 respondents \u2013 among whom 16 insurers \u2013 out of 131, 67 stakeholders did not reply and 14 had no opinion) agreed that there exists a strong interest from (re)insurance undertakings to increase their investments in securitisation. However, respondents stressed the necessity of suitable risk-return profiles, appropriate risk-based capital requirements in Solvency II and reduced due diligence requirements. Some stakeholders expressed concern that improvements may not lead to a short-term increase in securitisation for (re)insurers (7 respondents). In contrast, public authorities (3 respondents) generally have no interest in such increase in securitisation investment.\n\nFinancial institutions expressed divergent views on which securitisation segments are of interest for (re)insurers: CRE debt, CLO, RMBS, CMBS, true sale and synthetic structures. Notably, some financial institutions showed a preference for senior tranches. In contrast, others indicated that the seniority of the tranche and the distinction between true sale and synthetic are not decisive factors, provided the associated risks and returns align with their investment objectives. Some trade associations added that (re)insurers typically exhibit a broad appetite for investments across various securitisation segments, provided the investment delivers an appropriate risk-return profile. Their investment decisions are predominantly influenced by key factors such as yield, credit risk, and liquidity, rather than the specific structure of the securitisation vehicle (whether a true sale or synthetic structure). Consequently, the seniority of the tranche\u2014whether senior, mezzanine, or junior\u2014does not pose a constraint for (re)insurers, as long as the associated risks and returns are in line with their investment objectives.\n\nThe majority of the financial institutions, trade associations and public authorities, including insurers identified significant obstacles to increase securitisation investments (53 respondents \u2013 among whom 19 insurers \u2013 out of 131, 14 had no opinion and 64 did not reply). These include, but are not limited to, \u2018disproportionate\u2019 capital requirements imposed on securitisations compared to other financial instruments with similar credit risk and asset quality, and that the European securitisation market is too small and illiquid.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStakeholders were split on whether internal models disincentivise securitisation investments under Solvency II (29 yes, 9 no, 20 \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019, 73 did not reply). A minority of respondents, amongst whom all public authorities, and a minority of financial institutions, believed that internal models do not have a disincentivising effect. Conversely, the majority of respondents (financial institutions and trade associations) concluded that internal models do indeed disincentivise securitisation investments under Solvency II. They pointed out that such models are subject to the same non-prudential impediments as (re)insurers using the standard formula. Stakeholders noted that supervisory attitudes can vary amongst jurisdictions and costs to maintain an internal model are high. They also add that (re)insurers using internal models may struggle to accurately capture the complexities of underlying securitisation, which can lead to overly conservative assumptions and, subsequently, higher capital charges. In addition, they identify possible model-building miscalibration on the asset side due to the use of historical post financial crisis data.\n\n1.3.2. Senior STS securitisations\n\n\u2013The majority of stakeholders (40 respondents out of 131, 70 either did not reply or had no opinion), mainly financial institutions and trade associations, including insurers, indicated that the Solvency II standard formula capital requirements for spread risk is disproportionate and not commensurate with the risk of senior STS securitisation. One respondent suggests that the enhanced transparency of STS securitisation, combined with the presence of credit mechanisms such as guarantees or credit reserves, enables more accurate risk assessment, which should result in lower capital requirements. Whilst one public authority supports the view that the capital requirements are punitive, a majority of public authorities expressed a differing opinion, stating that there is no evidence to suggest that the calibration method for senior STS securitisations is inappropriate.\n\nStakeholders present two main views on the \u2018appropriate\u2019 calibration of capital requirements for senior STS. First, respondents argued that Solvency II\u2019s emphasis on market risk volatility creates a burden that discourages investments in securitisations. According to these stakeholders, as (re) insurers typically adopt a hold-to-maturity approach, they suggested that capital calculations should be based on default risk, including recovery levels, and not spread risk. Second, respondents argued that risk charges for senior STS are disproportionally high, both in absolute terms and relative to equally rated bonds. To address this, a minority of respondents proposed aligning STS bonds with capital charges for other collateralised instruments (such as covered bonds) following Perraudin and Qiu (2022) 83 (6 respondents). These authors suggest a 1.3 ratio for senior STS ratio to covered bonds.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOnly two financial institutions commented on the assessment of internal models and their impact on securitisation investments. Both argued that (re)insurers using internal models can adjust capital requirements in accordance with their own risk assessment, enabling more flexible management of both capital and due diligence requirements. This flexibility highlights the disparity between (re)insurers using the standard formula and those using internal models. Notably, these financial stakeholders pointed out that the standard formula\u2019s capital requirements are less adaptable and fail to fully capture the risk reduction benefits associated with STS securitisations.\n\n1.3.3. Non-senior STS securitisations\n\nAgain, the majority of stakeholders (39 out of 63 respondents \u2013 among whom 12 insurers \u2013 out of 131, 68 either did not reply), including all financial institutions and trade associations, indicated that the Solvency II standard formula capital requirements for spread risk is disproportionate and not commensurate with the risk of non-senior STS securitisation. The same public authority as in section 1.3.2. supports the view that capital requirements are punitive, whilst a majority of public authorities stated that there is no evidence to suggest that the calibration method for non-senior STS securitisations is inappropriate.\n\n\u00a0\n\nRespondents acknowledged that non-senior tranches do have a higher risk of default than senior tranches. Nevertheless, these securitisations are often covered by credit mechanisms, such as first loss tranches or credit reserves. Furthermore, stakeholders highlighted that investors in STS securitisations often have better visibility on the underlying assets, enabling more accurate risk assessments. As a result, stakeholders argued that capital requirements should be reduced to better reflect actual risk.\n\nSimilar to the calibration approach put forward in section 1.3.2., financial institutions and trade associations suggested that prudential requirements for non-senior STS securitisations in Solvency II should be more consistent with those for bonds and loans with the same rating (18 respondents). In support of this, respondents refer to the paper of Perraudin and Qiu (2022), which suggests a 1.5 ratio for non-senior STS to senior STS capital requirements (5 respondents).\n\nWith regards to differentiating the Solvency II standard formula capital requirements for spread risks between mezzanine and junior tranches, views within the stakeholder groups were split (17 respondents \u2013 among whom 2 insurers \u2013 supported differentiation, 19 respondents \u2013 among whom 9 insurers \u2013 did not express interest or opposed, and 22 had no opinion out of a total of 131; 73 stakeholders did not reply). Half of the financial institutions, trade associations and public authorities opposed such differentiation. \u00a0 They claim it adds unnecessary complexity (such as defining tranche thickness) and the focus should rather be on reducing overall capital calibrations for STS securitisations (9 respondents). Additionally, some respondents reiterated their previous suggestion in section 1.3.2, namely\u00a0that risk should be determined by credit risk rather than a temporary risk spread (8 respondents). They believe a more balanced approach would enable insurers to evaluate securitisation holistically, integrating it into their ALM framework without being hindered by excessive capital requirements.\n\nIn contrast, the other half of financial institutions, trade associations and public authorities who supported differentiation between mezzanine and junior tranches, argue that the capital charge should reflect the risks taken. Uniform capital charges for mezzanine and junior tranches could disincentivize investment, despite mezzanine tranches offering a balanced risk-reward profile between senior and junior tranches. One respondent added that differentiation would enable (re)insurers using internal models to better understand and manage risks, making more informed investment decisions, particularly in STS securitisations where transparency is key.\n\nAlthough supportive of differentiation, stakeholders put forward limited responses on how to subsequently define this mezzanine tranche, which calibration methods they deem as appropriate and why such mezzanine calibration would be justified in Solvency II (even if no dedicated treatment for mezzanine tranches is introduced in CRR). One public authority shared that mezzanine tranches should be determined through a prudent risk assessment, considering the attachment point value to avoid underestimating risk. A low attachment point can increase risk by creating a thin first-loss tranche. A trade association and public authority add that CRR does take into amount attachment and detachment points as inputs to compute the associated capital requirement (SEC-IRBA and SEC-SA methods).\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.3.4. Non-STS securitisations\n\nConsistent with the findings in section 1.3.2 and 1.3.3, all financial institutions (except one) and trade associations, amongst whom a significant group insurers and insurers\u2019 associations consider the Solvency II standard formula capital requirements for spread risk disproportionate and not commensurate with the- risk of non-STS securitisation. Respondents (40 respondents out of 131, 19 had no opinion and 70 did not provide an answer) emphasized the need to stimulate the securitisation market by eliminating the disparity in risk charges between non-STS and STS securitisations, which in their view disproportionately penalizes non-STS deals. Again, the study of Perraudin and Qiu (2022) is cited as evidence of a substantial miscalibration of capital charges relative to historic volatility data (6 respondents).\n\nIn contrast, 2 respondents (one financial institution and one public authority) argue that there is no evidence to suggest that the calibration method for non-STS securitisations is flawed. The same public authority as in section 1.3.2 and 1.3.3.) posits that the non-STS class, with fewer safeguards and including non-EU based originators, sponsors, and SSPEs, justifies the inclusion of post-financial crisis data in the calibration. The authority argues this implicitly accounts for additional risks such as agency and model risk, through the capital charges.\n\nWhen asked to identify specific sub-segment of non-STS securitisation for which evidence would justify lower capital requirements, financial institutions and trade associations suggested no industry wide segment or specific class which fits a \u2018uniform\u2019 insurance model. The following segments for recalibration are put forward: granular pools (3 respondents), CLO (3 respondents), CRE debt (3 respondents) and RMBS (1 respondent).\n\nA majority of respondents (39 respondents among who 14 insurers, out of 131, 17 respondents had no opinion and 71 did not provide an answer), in particular financial institutions and trade associations support differentiating the Solvency II standard formula capital requirements for spread risks between senior and non-senior tranches of non-STS securitisations. They argue that the current framework is insufficiently risk-based and that more granular approach, with \u2018tranche thicknesses\u2019 is needed. However, apart from references to Perraudin and Qiu (2022), no other concrete suggestions for calibration were provided through the public consultation responses.\n\nIn contrast, respondents opposing such differentiation, amongst whom one financial insurance institution and a majority of public authorities, argue that the focus should be on the type of securitisation rather than just the seniority. They also caution that introducing differentiation would add unnecessary complexity, in addition to uncertainty about the effectiveness of this measure.\n\n1.4. Prudential framework for institutions for occupational retirement provision (IORPs) and other pension funds\n\nNote: Respondents to this section represented a diverse range of stakeholders, with only 2 identifying themselves as IORPs. The remaining limited number of respondents comprised a mix of banks, associations for financial markets, NCAs, etc representing the interests of (non)-IORPs.\n\n1.4.1. Interest for investments in securitisation\n\nA total of 12 respondents out of 131 expressed a view with regards to their interest in securitisation investments (94 out of 131 didn\u2019t respond and 25 had no opinion). Of these 12 respondents, a majority (11 out of 131, amongst whom 2 IORPs), expressed a general interest to increase IORPs\u2019 investments in securitisation to diversify their portfolio. However, they emphasized the need for a more liquid market, with high quality securitisations to make investment more appealing. A limited number of respondents (2 replies out of 131, amongst whom no IORPS) identify the segments of interest to these pensions\u2019 institutions, including synthetic on-the-balance-sheet securitisations and senior and mezzanine tranches. No further details were provided by stakeholders. Notably, only one respondent, a public authority, reported no interest from both IORPs and non-IORPs in increasing their investment in securitisation.\n\n1.4.2. Obstacles for investments in securitisation\n\nA total of 8 respondents expressed a view with regards to obstacles to securitisation (98 didn\u2019t respond and 25 had no opinion). Out of these 8 respondents, a majority (6 out of 131, amongst whom no IORPs), indicated that the IORP II Directive does not contain provisions that restrict IORPs\u2019 ability to invest in securitisations. Out of these 8 respondents, a majority (6 out of 131, amongst whom no IORPs), indicated that the IORP II Directive does not contain provisions that restrict IORPs\u2019 ability to invest in securitisations. They argued that the Directive is based on minimum harmonization, allowing for sufficient flexibility in investment decisions as long as the fiduciary duty and the prudent person principle are respected. Out of the 8 respondents, a minority of disagreed (2 out of 131, amongst whom 1 IORP) and, argued respondents disagreed with the majority view, arguing that the Directive contains indirect restricting provisions. They presented two key concerns. First, they noted that securitisation structures can exhibit a wide range of risk profiles, which may not be compatible with the conservative investment strategies often employed by IORPs. As a result, even in the absence of explicit restrictions, the regulatory framework and internal policies governing IORPs' investments can create significant barriers to investing in securitisations. Second, they highlighted the potential existence of indirect barriers in Article 19 of the Directive setting out the \u2018prudent person rule\u2019.\n\nGenerally, stakeholders agreed that national legislations or supervisory practices do not unduly restrict IORPs\u2019 and non-IORPs\u2019 ability to invest in securitisation (8 out of 131, 97 didn\u2019t respond and 24 had no opinion). Furthermore, respondents refrained from answering whether there are any wider structural barriers preventing pension funds from participating in the market. Nevertheless, two respondents out of 131 challenged this latter view, suggesting that overly restrictive and prescriptive due diligence and disclosure requirements act as an obstacle for investor participation. They argued that these requirements increase complexity and costs associated with securitisations, compared to other asset classes. To address this issue, they recommend reviewing the due diligence requirements, to introduce proportionality and simplifications, while maintaining overall prudence.\n\n1.5. Additional questions\n\nSection 12 of the Consultation covered general and wide-ranging questions covering respondents\u2019 views for the future direction of European securitisation, the international competitiveness of the EU securitisation market, the relative potential for different market segments to contribute to the Capital Markets Union, which regulatory measures could best stimulate issuance and investment, how to address the concentration of the EU securitisation market, and so forth.\n\nNearly half of the respondents (55 out of 131, 74 didn\u2019t respond or had no opinion) agree that the EU Securitisation Framework impacts the international competitiveness of EU issuers, sponsors and investors, whereas only two respondents answered that there is no impact on the competitiveness.\n\nSeveral respondents (25 out of 131, 76 did not respond) identified the different national legal and regulatory regimes, and the resulting higher costs as the main obstacles for cross-border securitisation. 17 respondents point to the STS homogeneity requirements as an obstacle for cross-border securitisations. Other obstacles to cross-border securitisation were listed as IT requirements or an uncertain regulatory approach. Several respondents (28 out of 131, 83 did not respond) agree that the EU's regulatory framework for cross-border securitisation needs improvement, and suggest measures such as replacing complex templates, establishing a pan-European securitisation vehicle, and streamlining STS criteria.\n\nSeveral respondents (32 out of 131, 80 did not respond) identified regulatory, market and liquidity factors as the main obstacles to increasing securitisation activity in EU Member States. To address these issues, a few respondents (19 out of 131, 80 did not respond) suggested simplifying and harmonising regulatory frameworks, enhancing transparency and reporting standards, and promoting securitisation in smaller countries. Stakeholders\u2019 views are split regarding the effectiveness of regulatory changes in stimulating securitisation activity, with some arguing that changes are necessary and others being sceptical.\n\nSeveral respondents (23 out of 131, 79 did not respond) think that the EU's securitisation framework for green transition financing can be improved by simplifying the regulatory framework, creating tax and financial incentives.\n\nApproximately 10 respondents, principally large multinational asset managers or their interest representatives, criticised the 10% acquisition limit under Article 56 of the UCITS Directive, which they claim is triggered more easily for securitisation products than corporate debt. Critics of this provision argue that this limit, which aims to ensure diversification of risk and delimit excessive investor concentration, is unsuitable to securitisation investments, which are intrinsically diversified compared to bond issuances. These respondents emphasised the need for exemptions or adjustments to facilitate more competitive and diversified portfolio strategies for EU investors. Stakeholders disagree on which type of securitisation (traditional vs. synthetic; STS vs. non-STS) can most significantly contribute to the achievement of CMU.\n\nA number of respondents (21 out of 131, 79 did not respond) agree that the current regulatory review should promote a comprehensive framework, rather than targeting certain segments. A minority of respondents (43 out of 131, 81 did not respond) believe that the principal reasons for the slow growth of the placed traditional securitisation are low returns due to high capital charges and operational costs, as well as difficulties in placing senior tranches.\n\nThere is no consensus on why alternative instruments such as covered bonds are preferred funding instruments in the EU. However, there is a consensus that a combination of targeted measures can stimulate traditional securitisation issuance, and that there is no \u201csilver bullet\u201d to singularly revitalise the market. Furthermore, in the view of 22 respondents, simplifying due diligence and transparency requirements would be beneficial, while only one respondent (a major asset manager) viewed that the due diligence and transparency requirements were not a cause for concern.\n\nFinally, as far as securitisations of consumers loans and specifically mortgage loans are concerned, consumer organisations reiterated their concern that the securitisation severs the link between lenders and borrowers, making forbearance and loan restructuring more difficult to apply to the detriment of borrowers.\n\n1.6. Additional or late feedback\n\nStakeholders were offered the opportunity to make an attachment to their contribution to cover any topic or provide any complementary information that they would deem useful. 57 stakeholders provided such inputs. Most of them aimed at expanding or clarifying the stakeholder\u2019s point of view on certain areas of the consultation.\n\n2 \u2013 Call for Evidence\n\nA call for evidence was opened between 19 February 2025 and 26 March 2025 84 to request feedback from stakeholders on the review of the Securitisation Framework. Stakeholders were asked to provide views on the Commission's understanding of the problem and possible solutions, as well as provide relevant information, including on the possible impacts of the different options. 34 respondents replied to the call for evidence and presented their views. 85 Out of those 34 respondents, 26 86 had also replied to the targeted consultation with their views remaining broadly the same as outlined in the sections above. Points made by first-time respondents \u2013 outlined is greater detail below - were also consistent with the targeted consultation feedback received earlier. Taken together, views submitted in response to the Call for Evidence are already reflected in the reasoning informing the Impact Assessment and do not necessitate any change to the problem definition, choice of options and assessment of impact, as informed by previous feedback.\n\nThe views of the 8 other respondents can be summarised as follows:\n\n1. One of the two EU citizens who responded raised concerns about market fragmentation and advocated for the creation of a government agency structure, akin to that of the United States, to promote securitisation and eliminate agency risk and moral hazard. They disagreed that AIFMs should be subject to the same capital rules as banks (to be noted that the capital rules for AIFMs are outside of the scope of the current initiative). The matter of public guarantees for securitisation structures is considered in Annex VI: Securitisation Platform(s). The other citizen respondent made a general argument against government economic intervention; however, these points were not specific to securitisation or the instant initiative.\n\n2. The two business associations represented securitisation market participants and were broadly supportive of the review. One called for greater clarity on the scope and definitions of the SECR and argued that AIFMs should be granted risk-retention and subject to the same capital rules as banks. Scope and definitions are considered in the Impact Assessment Section 5.2.1, Measures to Reduce High Operational Costs. The other respondent advocated for a simplification of transparency and due diligence requirements. This concern is addressed in the above Impact Assessment, see Section 7, Comparison and Preferred Combination of Policy Options.\n\n3. One company was in favour of introducing more risk-sensitive prudential rules, including recalibrating securitisation capital charges for banks and insurers. They highlighted the need for capital rules that reflect the actual risks of securitisation exposures, to facilitate grater investment, particularly for the climate and digital transitions. This concern is addressed in the above Impact Assessment, see Section 7, Comparison and Preferred Combination of Policy Options. Another company made the point that debtors must be given the first chance to repurchase their securitised loans at the same price.\n\n4. The NGO respondent pointed out that while increased securitisation might free up additional lending, this may not necessarily benefit green or sustainable investments, but may rather be channelled towards polluting activities. It therefore called for mandatory rules for green securitisations, and the establishment of environmental safeguards to avoid securitisation being used for fossil fuel assets. Section 7.2 above discusses the current framework for green securitisation.\n\n5. A respondent identifying as \u201cOther\u201d (though representing companies in the investment and pension fund sectors), called for a review of SECR and IFRS 9 to change how institutional investors\u2019 fund investments are treated, as current rules increase balance sheet volatility and discourage investment. Any review or amendment to IFRS 9 is beyond the scope of this current initiative.\n\n3 - Bilateral contacts with stakeholders\n\nA wide range of bilateral contacts were held with various stakeholders during the preparation of this initiative, mostly by videoconference. Consulted parties included issuers, investors, sponsors, servicers, arrangers, third-party verifiers, data repositories, rating agencies, industry associations, and competent authorities. For the most part, the stakeholders with whom the Commission engaged bilaterally also responded to the targeted consultation, and their written response to the survey captured or repeated the main messages they had previously conveyed in the bilateral meetings.\n\n4 - Stakeholder Workshop\n\nOn 3 July 2024, the Commission hosted a Securitisation Workshop, which invited 28 representatives of EU securitisation participants to an in-person event on the Commission\u2019s premises in Brussels, to share their views. The day-long discussion was split across three panels: (i) EU securitisation market developments: focus on the issuers\u2019 perspective; (ii) Balancing safety and effectiveness of securitisation exposures: prudential requirements for banks and insurers; and (iii) Decrypting the demand side: zooming into STS and due diligence. Amongst attendees were representatives from the banking industry/associations, Ministries, European Supervisory Authorities, the SSM, EIB, insurers, asset managers, and pension funds. A summary of the main takeaways by topic is presented below.\n\nImprovements in disclosure and due diligence are nice to have, but changes in prudential treatment for banks and insurers are a must-have. With the withdrawal of the ECB from the market, participants reported a lack of senior investor base, leading to the market struggling to absorb bigger transactions. Issuers reported that when it comes to placing a deal, the biggest issue is finding investors for the senior tranche due to its size and low yield. Senior investors are primarily banks and insurers which are weighted down by capital requirements which often make investing in senior tranches unattractive compared to the yield. The absence of insurers among senior investors was highlighted. UCITS regulation (the 10% issuing entity limit) also seems to limit the ability of UCITS to participate more strongly in the market.\n\nWith regard to the prudential treatment for banks, some respondents called for a holistic approach and suggested the following measures:\n\n\u00b7\nIntroducing a risk-sensitive risk-weight floor was favoured by the floor as an idea that can be introduced relatively quickly (quick-fix), could incentivise the securitisation of low-RW assets and does not seem controversial.\n\n\u00b7\nRevising the p-factor, on the other hand, would require more work (not a short-term solution as it ideally has to go through Basel) and it might not have the desired impact as it could incentivise banks to buy into riskier tranches.\n\n\u00b7\nLCR treatment is an important factor but there does not seem to be consensus that ABS positions are sufficiently liquid to deserve an upgrade in the LCR buckets. Nevertheless, improvements could be made in this area, namely addressing the haircuts that apply to ABS positions in the LCR buckets and the ratings cliff.\n\nOn the topic of prudential regulation for insurers, insurance industry representatives acknowledged that due to the nature of their business, securitisation would remain a niche investment in their portfolio. They argued that the impact of the Solvency II formulas on securitisation investment is stronger than what supervisors perceive, even for internal-model users which can be asked to justify significant deviation from standard formulas parameters. The capital treatment of holding non-STS securitisation was viewed as both punitive and not reflecting risk.\n\nThe Securitisation Framework\u2019s due diligence requirements were listed as a barrier for smaller investors to enter the market. Compliance costs were reported as unduly high due to lack of proportionality (e.g. repeat transactions with the same issuer and from the same programme require the same due diligence).\n\nOn transparency disclosure, various, sometimes conflicting, points were made from different market participants. For synthetic and other private securitisation investors, the standard templates were not seen to be useful, and investors reported that they obtain the necessary transparency information through bilateral negotiation rather than relying on the standard templates. Other investors viewed access to standardised information as important: the more information available via the repositories, the better. A supervisor highlighted that the templates should better reflect investor\u2019s basic needs and should be more developed in cooperation with the industry.\n\nParticipants requested that synthetic securitisation\u00a0not be neglected in any forthcoming review of the Framework. While they highlighted the importance of reviving the cash segment, synthetic transactions also contribute toward financing the real economy. No obvious avenues were highlighted to increase the use of Simple, Transparent and Standardised (STS)\u00a0securitisation\u00a0or to scale up the market through the use of STS.\n\nWhile participants reported investor demand for SME/corporate loan securitisation, access to the right information for due diligence was cited as a challenge. Investors tend to be more comfortable when the securitised portfolios involve long-standing clients of the originating bank(s). SME loans were viewed as more likely to be securitised synthetically. Finally, some respondents pointed out that as SMEs are part of all market segments (trade receivables, leases), incentivising securitisation across the board will also benefit SMEs (e.g. an SME that borrows using real estate as collateral will not appear on the banking book as an SME loan but rather as a mortgage loan).\n\nThe Commission services invited workshop participants to provide their views through the targeted consultation that would follow, which would be duly considered in the preparation of the impact assessment and any ensuing legislative proposal.\n\n5 - Input from the ESAs and ESRB\n\nThe ESAs were consulted and carried out important analytical that fed our analysis. In particular, the 2021 Art. 44 Joint Committee report on the implementation and functioning of the Securitisation Regulation 87 which focused on the implementation of the general requirements applicable to securitisations, including the risk retention, due-diligence and transparency requirements as well as on the specific requirements related to STS securitisations. The Joint Committee has been working on its second report due for publication by early 2025. The expert discussions that took place in the preparation and drafting of this document have also informed our reasoning. Another important contribution came from the findings of the ESAs opinion on the jurisdictional scope of the Securitisation Regulation 88 and the compliance challenges that such jurisdictional scope posed for market participants.\n\nAnother important input has been the ESAs\u2019 Joint Committee advice on the review of the securitisation prudential framework 89 , which was published in December 2022 in response to the call for advice from the European Commission of October 2021. The Joint Committee report assessed the performance of the rules on capital requirements (for banks, insurance and reinsurance undertakings) and liquidity requirements (for banks) with respect to the framework\u2019s original objective of contributing to the sound revival of the EU securitisation framework.\n\nFinally, the insights from the 2022 European Systemic Risk Board\u2019 report \u201cMonitoring systemic risks in the EU securitisation market\u201d 90 on the financial stability implications of the EU securitisation market have also helped the assessment.\n\n5 - Input from Member States\n\nNational authorities were consulted in the framework of the Eurogroup Working Group+ (EWG+), and the Council Financial Services Committee (FSC). Several Member States also replied to the Targeted Consultation above through their finance ministries or central banks (FI, FR, IT, ES, DK, NL, BE, PL).\n\nOverall, Member States (expressing their views in the FSC and the EWG+) showed general willingness to reduce the operational costs for issuers and investors. They are more split as regards their appetite to reconsider prudential requirements for banks and insurers, and generally are unwilling to deviate materially from the Basel standards. Member States reported an openness to explore the potential benefits of a securitisation platform(s) as a measure to facilitate standardisation of the market, but most expressed opposition to a platform based on public guarantees (as in the US, where a significant part of the securitisation market is guaranteed by Government-Supported Entities or GSEs, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac).\n\nDuring the session of October 2024, the FSC discussed the issue of securitisation under the agenda item: \u201cFollow up on the future of CMU\u201d. COM and ECB representatives introduced a COM non-paper with a factual comparison of the securitisation frameworks in some selected jurisdictions, that was developed at the rest of the FSC. There was overall a very extensive debate, with almost all Members taking the floor, and commenting not only on the content of the COM and ECB presentations, but also on what should be the focus of the upcoming reforms on securitisation. The Members seem to be open to introducing proportionality in transparency and due diligence requirements, and supporting the standardisation of the transactions, some are open to look into Solvency treatment. Many Members suggested examining the demand side as well (i.e. call for increasing the investor base in securitisation). Others expressed caution with respect to changes in the prudential treatment. Some Members highlighted the reforms should not endanger financial stability.\n\nMany Members also commented on the issue of platform: generally, Members supported platforms that support standardisation of the securitisation transactions, but were more cautious as regards the platforms involving the state guarantees. Some Members highlighted it is important to define target and objective of the reforms. The Chair concluded that some areas may be more important than the prudential treatment and may have bigger impact on the EU market (transparency, due diligence, supply and demand issues, standardisation etc), also because of the specificity of the EU market where we have many synthetic transactions.\n\nDuring the FSC session of February 2025, the Commission\u00a0shared preliminary feedback on the results of the consultation on the Securitisation Framework, as set out in the Section 1 of this Annex. Overall, views were expressed on both the conservative and ambitious side of where to set the \u201ccursor\u201d for the ambition of the initiative. There was a clear consensus on the need for action on the Framework, with Member States emphasising that any measures must be evidence-based and balanced. On the platform and public guarantees, the issue needs further analysis and the different approaches \u2013 national, EU-wide, or private \u2013 merit further discussion. No clear picture emerged from respondents favourable or opposed to guarantees \u2013 many large financial institutions on both sides of the debate, alongside NGOs and MS.\n\nDuring the session of 28 November 2024 EWG+ there was a high degree of convergence on the issues to tackle: prudential regulation, reporting requirements, the need to simplify, to correct an excessive reaction in previous round of legislation. On the Platform, preliminary discussions at the EWG+ indicated very few Member States would favour a pan-European platform with guarantees (national, supplemented by EU-level). For most Member States, however, attaching public guarantees to securitisation issuance is a controversial topic. One MS appeared to favour a market-led structure without guarantees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnex III: Who is affected and how?\u00a0\n\n1 - Practical implications of the initiative\n\nThis Annex summarises the costs and benefits of the preferred options, which address the following problems identified in chapter 2 :\n\n\u00b7\nProblem 1: High operational costs for all issuers and investors\n\n\u00b7\nProblem 2: Undue prudential barriers for banks to issue and invest in securitisation\n\n\u00b7\nProblem 3: Undue prudential costs for insurers to invest in the EU securitisation market\n\nIn order to address the identified problems, a combination of three policy options is chosen (see Section 5 for a detailed description and Section 6 for an assessment): Option 1.1 targeted measures to reduce high operational costs, Option 2.1 targeted changes to existing prudential (capital and liquidity) framework for banks, and Option 3.2 improving risk sensitivity and removing prudential barriers to investments by insurers in the safest tranches of non-STS securitisation.\n\nUnder option 1.1., issuers (originators, sponsors and SSPEs) would have to disclose information for their securitisations using simpler templates than under the baseline. Consequently, issuers would have to adapt their reporting systems. Investors would carry out lighter and more proportionate due diligence on their securitisation investments.\n\nUnder option 2.1 banks would be subject to more risk sensitive capital requirements for securitisation positions. In addition, banks would be able to hold a broader set of securitisations for their liquidity buffers. Finally, option 2.1 banks would be able to benefit from faster and more coherent process of supervisory assessment of transactions\u2019 eligibility for capital relief.\n\nUnder Option 3.2, insurers would apply differentiated capital requirements for their investments into senior and non-senior tranches of non-STS securitisations.\n\n2 - Summary of costs and benefits\n\nThe figures below summarise first the costs and benefits of the preferred option:\n\n\u00b7\nFigure 7: Provides an overview of benefits of the preferred combination of policy options.\n\n\u00b7\nFigure 8: Summarises the costs of the preferred combination of policy options\n\n\u00b7\nFigure 9: Summarises the administrative cost\u00a0changes of the preferred combination of policy options for the one-in-one-out calculator\n\n\u00b7\nFigure 10: Summarises the costs and benefits of the baseline scenario of the current Securitisation Regulation\u00a0(based on the Evaluation)\n\n\u00b7\nFigure 11: Shows how the preferred combination of policy options might impact the sustainable development goals\n\nFigure 7: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Overview benefits of the preferred combination of policy options\n\nDescription\n\n\t\n\nAmount\n\n\t\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\nDirect benefits\n\n\n\n\nReduction of operational costs for due diligence and transparency requirements Articles 5 and 7 of SECR\n\n\t\n\nEUR 310 million p.a. of recurring costs\n\n\t\n\nFor a detailed explanation of the cost savings see \u201cDetails of costs and benefits\u201d section below.\n\n\n\n\nRemoval of undue prudential barriers and increase of risk sensitivity of the capital requirements for banks\n\n\t\n\nExpected reduction of capital requirements for senior tranches, to which banks are most exposed to, by one third\n\n\t\n\nMaking capital requirements for securitisation more risk-sensitive will reduce the amount of capital requirements for banks\u2019 securitisation exposures in some cases, but the overall level of capitalisation is expected to remain prudent and proportionate and risk-sensitive to the associated risks.\n\n\n\n\nMore consistent liquidity framework in banking\n\n\t\n\nNot quantifiable\n\n\t\n\nThe changes would strengthen the incentives for banks to invest in publicly traded STS traditional securitisations, would help diversify banks\u2019 liquidity buffers and would increase the liquidity of this market segment.

Life policyholders (consumers) can therefore obtain higher return on their savings.\n\n*Some elements are not quantifiable due to various reasons, such as (i) it is difficult to assess behavioural changes of market participants as a result of the changed framework; (ii) the options include a series of measures including several parameters, rather than a single measure; and (iii) a number of measures are qualitative (i.e. increasing the quality of the rules).\n\n(1) Estimates are gross values relative to the baseline for the preferred option as a whole (i.e. the impact of individual actions/obligations of the preferred option are aggregated together); (2) Please indicate in the comments column which stakeholder group is the main recipient of the benefit;(3) For reductions in regulatory costs, please describe in the comments column the details as to how the saving arises (e.g. reductions in adjustment costs, administrative costs, regulatory charges, enforcement costs, etc.;);.\n\n\nFigure 8: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Overview costs \u2013 preferred option\n\n\t\n\nCitizens/ Consumers\n\n\t\n\nBusinesses\n\n\t\n\nAdministrations\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nOne-off\n\n\t\n\nRecurrent\n\n\t\n\nOne-off\n\n\t\n\nRecurrent\n\n\t\n\nOne-off\n\n\t\n\nRecurrent\n\n\n\n\nTargeted measures to reduce high operational costs in due diligence and disclosure\n\n\t\n\nDirect adjustment costs\n\n\t\n\nNone\n\n\t\n\nNone\n\n\t\n\nNone\n\n\t\n\nNone\n\n\t\n\nNone\n\n\t\n\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nDirect administrative costs \u2013 linked to the due diligence and transparency requirements of Art. 5 and Art. 7\n\n\t\n\nNone\n\n\t\n\nNone\n\n\t\n\nImplementation of simplified reporting template: EUR 33 million.\n\n\t\n\nAdditional reporting of private transactions to securitisation repositories: EUR 7 million p.a.\n\n\t\n\nNone\n\n\t\n\nSupervisors will have to spend more resources to understand risk management practices.

Data for the public market is drawn from the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME). Less data is publicly available for the private market, however the EBA is collecting data in their Common Reporting Framework (GL). EBA data can show only that part of the private market where a bank is involved in least on one side of the transaction (investor or originator/sponsor/original lender). To our knowledge, no data is available for the private market without any bank involvement.\n\nThe below cost estimation uses the latest available data (end-2023) for both public and private market segments.\u00a0\n\n\nFigure 11: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Market data on EU securitisations (end-2023)\n\nDimension\n\n\t\n\nPublic market 93 \u00a0\n\n\t\n\nPrivate Market 94 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding notional amount (end 2023)\n\n\t\n\nEUR 1\u00a0003.3 billion. 95\n\n\t\n\nEUR 632\u00a0billion. 96\n\n\n\n\nSynthetic vs. Traditional\n\n\t\n\nThe public market links to traditional securitisations.\n\n\t\n\nThe non ABCP share of the private market (about 88%) is split approx. 50%-50% between synthetic and traditional securitisations.\n\n\n\n\nAsset class\n\n\t\n\nThe public market (excluding ABCP ~10%) is dominated by residential mortgages (~47%), followed by corporate exposures securitised as CLO (~19%), SME ABS (~13%), Consumer loans (~9%), Auto loans (~7%), and other exposures (~5%) including corporate mortgages, credit cards and leases.\n\n\t\n\nFor the synthetic market segment apply and receive significant risk transfer (almost 100%) the main underlying collateral is corporate loans including SME (~73%) followed by residential mortgages, consumer loans and credit card exposures with about 6-8% each. For ABCP transactions the main collateral types are trade receivables (~50%) and corporate loans (~30%).\n\n\n\n\nSRT vs. non-SRT\n\n\t\n\nAFME estimates 2021-2023 European (also including non-EU) SRT to total EUR 263.3 billion. Assuming that 75% of this total can be attributed to EU countries and that the issued volume was still outstanding by the end of 2023, this corresponds to about EUR 197 billion or about 20%.\n\n\t\n\nMost SRT transactions are synthetic. If a securitisation is synthetic, it is linked 1:1 to an SRT application, so 100% of synthetic transactions are SRT. For the traditional segment the SRT share is about 20%.\n\n\n\n\nRetained vs. Placed\n\n\t\n\nRecent issuance data shows that on average 2019-2023, about 50% of the securitisations (excluding ABCP) are retained on the balance sheet whereas the other 50% are placed on the market.\n\n\t\n\nIn synthetic transactions, the assets are always retained on the balance sheet, only the risk is transferred.\n\n\n\n\nSTS vs. non-STS\n\n\t\n\nSTS transactions volumes for the public market are not publicly reported, therefore, we rely on COREP data examined by the EBA which indicates a share of about 34% STS transactions for public securitisations with bank involvement.\n\n\t\n\nIn the private market about 40% are STS, based on COREP data examined by the EBA.\n\n\n\n\nAAA, other investment grade, sub-investment grade\n\n\t\n\nMost securitisations are AAA (54%) or AA (31%), followed by (11%) in the investment grade segment and only 3% sub-investment grade.\n\n\t\n\nFor the private segment no rating distribution is available, but we expect a significantly higher share with lower ratings as SRT is only possible for exposures bearing risk.\n\n3.\nNature of duties due diligence requirements (Article 5)\n\nThe due diligence requirements of Article 5 SECR oblige institutional investors to perform a risk assessment of the securitisations they invest in. These requirements are designed to protect investors, to assure regulatory compliance and to ensure that all parties involved in the securitisation transaction have access to accurate and timely information concerning the underlying assets, securitisation structure, and associated risks. The main due diligence requirements apply to investors and include:\n\n1.\nVerification requirements prior to entering into a securitisation position:\n\no\nVerification of credit granting standards (only if the originator is neither an EU investment firm nor an EU credit institution or if it is located outside of the EU)\n\no\nVerification of risk-retention\n\no\nVerification of fulfilment of disclosure obligations required by Article 7 by the originator or sponsor or SSPE\n\no\nVerification of sound selection procedure and pricing for non-performing exposures\n\n2.\nRisk-assessment prior to entering a securitisation position including:\n\no\nAssessment of risk characteristics of the individual position and of the underlying exposures\n\no\nAssessment of the structural features of the securitisation that can materially impact the performance of the securitisation position, including the contractual priorities of payment and priority of payment-related triggers, credit enhancements, liquidity enhancements, market value triggers, and transaction-specific definitions of default;\n\no\nSTS verification: checking the compliance of that securitisation with the STS requirements provided for in Articles 19 to 22 or in Articles 23 to 26, and Article 27\n\n3.\nOngoing monitoring of the risk characteristics after entering a securitisation position including\u00a0\n\no\npercentage of loans more than 30, 60 and 90 days past due,\n\no\ndefault rates,\n\no\nprepayment rates,\n\no\nloans in foreclosure,\n\no\nrecovery rates,\n\no\nrepurchases,\n\no\nloan modifications,\n\no\npayment holidays,\n\no\ncollateral type and occupancy, and\n\no\nfrequency distribution of credit scores or other measures of credit worthiness across underlying exposures,\n\no\nindustry diversification\n\no\ngeographical diversification,\n\no\nfrequency distribution of loan to value ratios.\n\n4.\nOngoing stress-testing after entering a securitisation position:\n\no\nregularly perform stress tests on the cash flows and collateral values\n\no\nor stress test loss assumptions.\n\n5.\nOngoing reporting, both internally and to authorities:\n\no\nThe securitisation transaction must be backed by a homogeneous pool of exposures, such as pools of residential loans or corporate loans. The underlying exposures should not include transferable securities.\n\nHowever, sell-side parties support this due diligence process, e.g. by performing due diligence sessions where they guide investors through all relevant questions that need to be answered over the course of their due diligence process.\n\n4.\nCost drivers for Article 5 costs and separation of incremental costs from business-as-usual costs:\u00a0\n\nInvestors perform due diligence activities in their regular course of business. These costs that are linked to business-as-usual due diligence activities (\u201cBAU costs\u201d) are not relevant for the cost assessment, which focusses on \u201cincremental costs\u201d, i.e. costs that businesses would not incur in the absence of the EU Securitisation Framework. In the stakeholder consultation, securitisation investors pointed to the following costs that go beyond what those incurred in the regular course of business:\n\n\u00b7\nVerification beyond the assessment of the risk characteristics and the structural features of the transaction\n\n\u00b7\nDue diligence on originators that are regulated entities and that therefore can be assumed to have originated their assets based on sound-credit granting standards\n\n\u00b7\nElaborate due diligence for secondary market transactions that have already been checked by primary investors or are in the end of their life cycle with a high collateral to outstanding asset-ratio and hence with very low risk\n\n\u00b7\nDue diligence on repeat issuers that are already familiar to the investor\n\n\u00b7\nSTS verification\n\n\u00b7\nElaborate due diligence on low-risk transactions\n\n\u00b7\nCertain activities that are considered duplicative in nature, e.g. secondary or tertiary real-estate price valuations\n\n\u00b7\nRepetition of due diligence activities that have been performed by another party in the process (e.g. the asset manager)\u00a0\n\n5.\nClassification of due diligence costs from a better regulation perspective\n\nGiven that the substantial due diligence requirements extend largely to checking whether originators having fulfilled their duties in the credit origination and transparency process (which is an inspection duty performed on behalf of public authorities), as well as to internal reporting, it is reasonable to classify these as administrative costs for purposes of the better regulation process and to consider them in the One-In-One-Out calculation. 97\n\n6.\nOne-off costs due diligence\n\nTo establish appropriate due diligence procedures, investors in securitisations incur one-off efforts to adapt their due diligence procedures to the requirements of Article 5 SECR. Such one-off efforts involve familiarisation with the new rules, potentially obtaining legal advice for the correct interpretation of the rules and adapting internal procedures and guidance. It was not possible to obtain information on one-off implementation costs from the stakeholder consultation. Several large asset managers mentioned that they had already similar procedures in place before the legal framework was put into place, so there was no implementation effort. Other respondents mentioned that they had spent significant efforts, but that their processes adapted slowly over time and the exact costs of this effort cannot be accurately estimated.\n\nThe business association AFME estimated for new businesses the time necessary to understand and implement due diligence procedures to be 2-3 months out of the approximately 9 months required to set-up the whole securitisation business and has collected a cost sample for due diligence costs of that constitutes about 20% of asset managers investing in European securitisations, representing about 50% by ABS assets under management. They estimated the one-off start-up costs for a securitisation business to about EUR 400\u00a0000, with about 30% due to Art. 5 due diligence requirements, i.e. approx. EUR 130\u00a0000. AFME estimates the total number of asset managers investing in securitisations in the European market to be less than 20. In addition, the EBA estimates the number of bank investors to 55-127, where the lower bound are banks with the role \u201cinvestor\u201d only and the upper bound includes also banks with the role \u201coriginator\u201d, \u201coriginal lender\u201d or \u201csponsor\u201d. This means that the upper bound includes also banks that invest only in the retained tranches of their own securitisations, which are not acting as investors into third-party transactions in the market. To isolate market investors only, we assume that about half of the bank investors invest only inhouse, which corrects the range of bank investors to about 55-90 institutions. In addition, to get an indication of non-bank investors, we refer to published data of the ESRB that estimates the holding share\u00a0of banks in securitisations to 84% 98 , which implies an estimate of about 25 investors including an estimate of 11 investment firms 99 . in total about 80-115 investors, this amounts to about EUR 10 to 15\u00a0million.\n\n7.\nRecurring costs due diligence\n\nWhile due diligence requirements apply mainly to buy-side parties/investors, the consultation process has shown that sell-side parties (originators, original lenders, sponsors) take also a role in this process by supporting investors, e.g. by performing due diligence sessions where they guide investors through all relevant questions that need to be answered over the course of their due diligence process. Furthermore, for certain transactions due diligence activities are performed by asset managers acting as intermediaries as well as end-investors. The table below provides an estimation of the costs that apply at all levels of the due-diligence process and yields in total ab EUR 660 million p.a.\n\nSegment\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\nSell-side due diligence support costs(6)\n\n\t\n\nBuy-side due diligence cost(5)\n\n\t\n\nTotal due diligence\n\n\t\n\nMarket share in terms of underlying assets outstanding\n\n\t\n\nEstimated market due diligence cost\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\nInvestment firm (intermediary)\n\n\t\n\nEnd investor\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\nIn basis points of underlying asset pool\n\n\t\n\nBillion EUR\n\n\t\n\nMillion EUR\n\n\n\n\nSynthetic\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n0.3(2)\n\n\t\n\nn/a\n\n\t\n\n0.3(3)\n\n\t\n\n0.6\n\n\t\n\n295\n\n\t\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nObservations(1)\n\n\t\n\nN=6\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\nN=6\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nMax\n\n\t\n\n1.2\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n0.6\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nMin\n\n\t\n\n0.03\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n0.02\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nTradit-ional\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n2.0(7)\n\n\t\n\n12%(4)x2.5=0.3\n\n\t\n\n2.5(8)\n\n\t\n\n4.8\n\n\t\n\n1 340\n\n\t\n\n643\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nObservations\n\n\t\n\nN=3\n\n\t\n\nN=16\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nMin\n\n\t\n\n1.5\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nMax\n\n\t\n\n2.5\n\n\t\n\n24\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\nTotal\n\n\t\n\n1 635\n\n\t\n\n661\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n660 (rounded)\n\n(1) The observations for synthetic securitisations rely on the submission of the International Association of Credit Portfolio Managers (IACPM) that has collected a sample of observations among their members.\n\n(2) The due diligence support of originators in the synthetic SRT segment has been translated in basis points (i.e. 1/100 of a percentage point) by dividing absolute values of costs in EUR p.a. per transaction by the estimated average pool size of a synthetic transaction.\n\n(3) For the investor side, for synthetic SRT transactions the costs for 1-3 investors per transaction are assumed 100 and the mid-range (2 investors) is shown. To translate the cost values in EUR per transaction p.a. in basis points (i.e. 1/100 of a percentage point), the pool size has been used (not the secured amount/investment ticket size) in order to be able to scale up the cost to the market size that is expressed in outstanding underlying asset volumes.\n\n(4) The share of 12% has been taken as assumption for the share of market involvement of asset managers in the investment process of non-synthetic transactions and is based on a ESRB publication\u00a0on asset manager involvement in securitsation\u00a0transactions (with a correction to exclude banks holding their own retained shares only) 101 .\n\n(5) The classification as investor vs sell side of the replies received in the stakeholder consultation is as follows: If in the reply to question 0.16 \u201cinvolvement role\u201d was one of the following (no buy-side role and: \u201cinvestor in synthetic securitisations\u201d or \u201cInvestor in synthetic securitisations\u201d) or in a follow-up with the stakeholder it was clarified an investor role or if both roles were selected and the principal activity (question 0.13) is \u201cInvestment Management\u201d.\n\n(6) The classification of the replies received in the stakeholder consultation as sell-side has been performed if exclusively sell-side roles were selected, i.e. \u201coriginator of synthetic securitisations\u201d, \u201coriginator of traditional securitisations\u201d, \u201csponsor\u201d or \u201carranger\u201d or it was explicitly stated in a follow-up interaction.\n\n(7) Three observations were obtained in the traditional sell-side segment with a full range of 1.5-2.5 bps and the mid-value of 2.0 bps has been selected as representative value..\n\n(8) Observations from stakeholder consultation and related follow-up interactions. If reply showed absolute annual cost value per transaction, , a ticket size of EUR 10 million has been assumed \u2013 reflecting the median size of a median market transaction of approx. EUR 400 million and typical investor numbers per public transaction of 30-50 investors, which implies an average investment ticket size of EUR 10 million) \u2013 to translate into relative costs expressed in basis points. If explicitly stated in the reply, the ticket size of the respondent has been taken into account to obtain the relative costs.\n\n8.\nBenefits of moving to a more principles based and proportionate due diligence approach\n\nStakeholders responding to the public consultation almost unanimously welcomed the proposal of Option 1.1, i.e. a more principles based, less complex and proportionate due diligence approach (95% - i.e. 81/86 respondents to that question. Only 2 preferred to make the requirements even more detailed and prescriptive, and 3 would like to keep the regulation unchanged; an additional 45 respondents had no opinion).\n\nOne of the major benefits that respondents see in a more principles-based approach is the possibility to focus on risk areas of the transaction. For some transactions respondents would prefer lower due diligence requirements as the risks involved would not justify certain efforts.\n\nTransactions with repeat issuers were frequently mentioned. AFME estimates the share of repeat issuance to about 67% of the public market. 102 Apart from being dissatisfied with performing controls that are in other jurisdictions performed by public authorities, e.g. verifying EU issuers\u2019 compliance with risk retention requirements, the repetition of such checks for several transactions with the same issuer in a short period of time is seen as superfluous and unduly costly.\n\nSecondary market transactions were another frequent example in this context, where due diligence requirements could have a prohibitive effect as the time window available to give an offer (e.g. 1-2 days) was insufficient to perform all due diligence tasks. These can take (according to the consultation replies) up to 10 days. As a result, non-EU investors are reported to benefit by getting easier access to the securitisation investments in the secondary market, while certain EU investors are excluded. Furthermore, given that the underlying exposures amortise over time, the remaining time to maturity is much shorter and the relation between collateral and exposure much more favourable than for the initial primary transaction, hence the remaining risk is significantly reduced while the due diligence requirements remain unchanged. To our best knowledge, there was no publicly available market data on the share of primary vs. secondary transactions, but one experienced asset manager estimated the relationship between secondary to primary market transactions as about 50%:50% in the traditional securitisation market. In the synthetic market investments are usually held to maturity or until it can be called, i.e. they are not relevant for secondary market transactions.\n\nLow-risk transactions in the AAA or investment grade segment are another frequently mentioned example for transactions that require in the eyes of most investors a lower degree of due diligence activities. Investors would therefore prefer setting certain priority areas for their due diligence activities in line with the risk characteristics of the underlying collateral and the structural features of the transaction.\n\nWhile banking and insurance investors can offset the costs of additional STS compliance checks through preferential capital treatment, investment firms have no additional benefit and regard the label therefore rather as a \u201cnice-to-have\u201d. Transactions designated as STS are subject to additional checks which considered as particularly burdensome.\n\nHence, an AAA transaction with a repeat issuer in the secondary market could be considered the heaviest in terms of regulatory burden and the perceived excess burden of such transactions can be up to 75%. Based on the replies received in the stakeholder consultation, we estimate the savings potential as follows:\n\nFigure 12: Estimated savings recurring annual due diligence costs\n\nSegment\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\nSell-side due diligence support costs(6)\n\n\t\n\nBuy-side due diligence cost(5)\n\n\t\n\nTotal due diligence savings relative to asset pool\n\n\t\n\nMarket share in terms of underlying assets outstanding\n\n\t\n\nEstimated market due diligence cost\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\nAsset manager or other intermediary\n\n\t\n\nEnd investor\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\npercent\n\n\t\n\nbasis points\n\n\t\n\nBillion EUR\n\n\t\n\nMillion EUR\n\n\n\n\nSynthetic(1)\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n17%(3)\n\n\t\n\nn/a\n\n\t\n\n16%(2)\n\n\t\n\n0.1(5)\n\n\t\n\n295\n\n\t\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nObservations\n\n\t\n\nN=7\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\nN=6\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n0-25% (avg. 13%)\n\n\t\n\n83%\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n86%\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n26-50% (avg. 38%)\n\n\t\n\n17%\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n14%\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nTraditional(2)\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n38%(2)\n\n\t\n\n50%(4)\n\n\t\n\n2.2(6)\n\n\t\n\n1 340\n\n\t\n\n289\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nObservations\n\n\t\n\nN=2\n\n\t\n\nN=11\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nMin\n\n\t\n\n25%\n\n\t\n\n0%\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nMax\n\n\t\n\n50%\n\n\t\n\n50%\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n1 635\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nTotal EUR million\n\n\t\n\n103\n\n\t\n\n188\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n290 (rounded)\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nBasis points\n\n\t\n\n0.63\n\n\t\n\n1.15\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n1.8\n\n(1) In line with the observations of annual recurring due diligence costs, the submission of the association IACPM that was the only submission explicitly referring to synthetic securitisations and with a sample collected among their members has been taken as representative for the synthetic market segment.\n\n(2) Observations for the traditional market segment have been taken from the stakeholder consultation.\n\n(3) Weighted average savings potential, which results on the sell side from 83% of respondents stating a savings potential of 0%-25% (avg. 13%) and 17% of respondents estimating savings of 25%-50% (avg. 38%)..\n\n(4) Median savings potential\n\n(5) 0.3 basis points * 17% + 0.3 basis points * 16% = 0.1 basis points.

Initial values from the section above on recurring due diligence costs.\n\n(6) 2.0 basis points *36%+2.8 basis points *50%. Initial values from the section above on recurring due diligence costs.\n\nWe obtain a savings potential of about EUR 290 million for the EU securitisation market, due to the duplicative or redundant nature of the provisions that are proposed to be removed in the preferred combination of options. These savings come without expected negative impacts on the risks of individual transactions as well as the securitisation market as whole and EU macroeconomic financial stability.\n\nAnother frequently mentioned point linked to the due diligence requirements is a barrier to entry resulting from the magnitude of the due diligence duties. The barrier to entry is cited in over 40 replies to the stakeholder consultation. AFME estimates that setting-up a new EU securitisation investment business requires about 9 months of start-up with 2-3 months alone to understand and implement the due diligence rules. They show for the example in the Figure 13 below that an AAA STS asset management business requires about 40 months to reach profitability. The reason is that for low-yield products, the management fee is correspondingly low, therefore it takes long time as well as a very large pool of assets (estimated to about EUR 1,5 billion) to break even. This effectively excludes certain market players. This applies in particular to low yield high grade AAA products that are regarded as cash-equivalents by investors and that are quickly divested once cash is needed, which makes it more difficult to keep a sufficient investor base for such products. AFME estimates the universe of asset managers active in the public securitisation market to be below 20 players. For a comparable covered bond business, the number of players is significantly higher: AFME found alone 160 investors in a single covered bond product. As a result, simpler and more proportionate due diligence requirements could lead to an investor base 5 to 10 times larger than today\u2019s. More investors could significantly improve the liquidity in this market.\n\nFigure 13: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Estimated time to break-even for new market entrant building a business for a AAA STS securitisation\n\n\t\n\n9.\nNature of duties transparency requirements (Article 7)\n\nThe Transparency Requirements of Article 7 SECR oblige issuers of securitisations: originators, sponsors or SSPEs, to provide investors with information in a structured, comparable and reliable way. In contrast to other comparable instruments that require reporting on an aggregate level, securitisations require reporting on a loan-by-loan basis, including for granular exposures, such as credit card receivables. The main reporting obligations include among others:\n\n\u00b7\nTransaction documentation to be made available before pricing: The originator and sponsor must make available the contractual documents (e.g. asset sale agreement, derivatives and guarantee agreements, collateralisation arrangement) and for public transactions, the prospectus, for STS transactions, the STS notification as well as additional information on the static and dynamic historical default and loss performance with a sample of the underlying exposures subject to verification by an external third party (\u201cthird party verification\u201d or \u201cTPV\u201d) as well as in case of residential loans, auto loans or leases additional information on the environmental performance of the assets.\n\n\u00b7\nOngoing disclosure on underlying exposures: The originator and sponsor must make available on a quarterly basis (for ABCP on a monthly basis but only in aggregate form) information on the underlying exposures of a securitisation including the credit quality, performance, data on the cash flows generated and risk retained as well as event-triggered information (e.g. use of inside information or breach of obligations, change of structural features or risk characteristics). For STS transactions there are additional requirements to make available data on static and dynamic historical default and loss performance, such as delinquency and default data, for substantially similar exposures to those being securitised. Public securitisations are obliged to report to a Securitisation Repository and private securitisations via a private website following ESMA templates, which require a high number of datapoints compared to other financial instruments.\n\n10.\nDrivers of transparency costs and separation of incremental costs from business-as-usual costs:\u00a0\n\nAs the main cost drivers for the transparency regime, stakeholders mentioned:\n\n\u00b7\nThe high level of detail required by ESMA templates and the lack of consultation of market participants in the templates\u2019 creation, meaning that the templates often did not match investor needs and relevant information has to be obtained separately.\n\n\u00b7\nThe requirement of granular reporting, which can be very challenging for small exposures like credit-card, trade or leasing receivables. For comparable instruments like covered bonds, aggregate reporting is sufficient.\n\n\u00b7\nThe additional burden linked to STS reporting (such as default history) and verification\n\nHence, the incremental costs of Article 7 reporting result mainly from the granularity and unsuitability of templates, level of detail as well as from STS-specific reporting.\n\n11.\nClassification of transparency costs from a better regulation perspective\n\nAs the transparency requirements of Article 7 clearly link to disclosure and reporting they are classified as administrative costs from a better regulation perspective and are to be reported for One-In-One-Out purposes 104 .\n\n12.\nOne-off costs\u00a0transparency\n\nAt the time of the introduction of the Securitisation Framework, issuers (originators and sponsors) of securitisations incurred one-off implementation costs to adapt to the new disclosure infrastructure. Such implementation activities included (but were not limited to) familiarisation with the new transparency requirements (Level 1 regulation, Level 2 RTS, ITS and FAQ), sometimes involving legal advice, and IT implementation. Depending on the underlying exposures and issuers, the latter could require the opening of several relevant IT systems, e.g. for mortgages, corporate loans etc., adding to those systems data fields that were not previously covered. Furthermore, a reporting interface would need to be set up to provide disclosures in the required format. For small issuers, without such an extensive IT infrastructure, such disclosures might have been set-up in simpler ways, e.g. in Excel templates. In this context the number of asset classes covered (e.g. RMBS or corporate loans) is an important cost driver as each asset class requires individual reporting templates.\n\nConsultation respondents reported one-off costs in the range of EUR 27\u00a0000 to EUR 4\u00a0000\u00a0000, with an interquartile range of EUR 400\u00a0000 to EUR 1\u00a0300\u00a0000 and a median of EUR 900\u00a0000. Based on data provided by the European Data Warehouse we estimate approximately 260 public market issuers (originators and sponsors) 105 and based on EBA COREP data about 150 private market\u00a0issuers (originators and sponsors) that had to incur costs during the period 2019 to 2025 to set up a transparency regime. Of these 410 originators, we estimate about 330 to be still active. 106 \u00a0\n\nTaking the median value for implementation costs, i.e. EUR 900\u00a0000, we estimate the one-off implementation costs for the EU securitisation market to be approximately EUR 370 million.\n\nThese costs apply to businesses. Citizens were not directly affected by Securitisation Framework and hence incur no costs.\n\n13.\nRecurring costs\u00a0transparency\n\nOn the recurring transparency costs, we have collected the following information:\n\nFigure 14: Estimated market transparency cost\n\nType of transaction\n\n\t\n\nrepresentative value (by business association), rounded*\n\n\t\n\nobservations\n\n\t\n\nthereof from business associations\n\n\t\n\nmin\n\n\t\n\nmax\n\n\t\n\nEstimated no. outstanding transactions (rounded)**\n\n\t\n\nEstimated market cost (rounded)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nEUR\n\n\t\n\n#\n\n\t\n\n#\n\n\t\n\nEUR\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n#\n\n\t\n\nEUR\n\n\n\n\nTraditional, non-STS\n\n\t\n\n50 000\n\n\t\n\nN = 9\n\n\t\n\nN = 4\n\n\t\n\n15 000\n\n\t\n\n50 000\n\n\t\n\n820\n\n\t\n\n41 000 000\n\n\n\n\nTraditional, STS\n\n\t\n\n100 000\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n74 000\n\n\t\n\n100 000\n\n\t\n\n510\n\n\t\n\n51 000 000\n\n\n\n\nSynthetic, non-STS\n\n\t\n\n60 000\n\n\t\n\nN = 5\n\n\t\n\nN = 2\n\n\t\n\n6 000\n\n\t\n\n61 000\n\n\t\n\n100\n\n\t\n\n6 000 000\n\n\n\n\nSynthetic, STS\n\n\t\n\n80 000\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n78 000\n\n\t\n\n100 000\n\n\t\n\n110\n\n\t\n\n8 800 000\n\n\n\n\nCLO\n\n\t\n\n20 000\n\n\t\n\nN = 4\n\n\t\n\nN = 1\n\n\t\n\n10 000\n\n\t\n\n35 000\n\n\t\n\n440\n\n\t\n\n8 800 000\n\n\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n\t\n\n115 600 000\n\n\n\n\nRounded\n\n\t\n\n120 000 000\n\n* Due to a very small number of observations for each transaction type, information reported from business associations with a broad base of contributing institutions has been taken as representative value. For most segments the values reported by business associations are within the range of values reported by individual contributors.\n\n**The estimated transaction number is derived from the market volumes by segment as shown in Annex 3 and obtained from the AFME market data report Q4 2023 and the EBA. The market volume has been divided by average transaction sizes for the relevant market segment, where the average transaction size for public non-ABCP Transactions has been obtained from the European Data Warehouse; the average transaction size for private ABCP transactions from the association True Sale International in collaboration with the German Banking Association 107 ; and it has further been assumed that private traditional transactions have a comparable average size as public traditional and private synthetic SRT transactions. The average transaction size of CLO transactions for 2024 has been obtained from the The Alternative Credit Investor Magazine (March 10 2025).\n\nConsultation respondents considered transparency costs for EU securitisations to be significantly higher by stakeholders than the costs for comparable instruments like covered bonds, credit default swaps, credit linked notes, or non-EU securitisations (29 replies). Only 2 respondents assessed the costs as similar or moderately lower. The main reason for the additional costs is the required granularity (loan-level data) and the high number of data fields required by the templates.\n\nThere might also be opportunity costs in the sense that the reporting requirements prevent certain assets from being securitised. Some respondents mentioned that they were not able to collect or report certain datapoints for legacy transactions and therefore were not able to securitise them. However, such opportunity costs were not quantifiable by respondents.\n\n14.\nImpacts of the preferred policy option\n\nThe preferred policy Option 1.1 (\u201cStreamline the current disclosure templates for public securitisations. Introduce a simplified template for private securitisations. Require private securitisations to report to securitisation repositories\u201d) was the preferred choice of 76% of respondents to this question in the targeted consultation (54//71). 13 respondents preferred option 1.2 (\u201cRemove the distinction between public and private securitisations. Introduce principles\u2011based disclosure for investors without a prescribed template. Replace the current disclosure templates with a simplified prescribed template that fits the needs of competent\u201d). 4 respondents favoured \u201cno change\u201d, while 63 additional respondents had no opinion on this question.\n\nOption 1.1 was preferred by many respondents under the condition that it would mean retaining the current templates while introducing flexibility by using the \u201cno-data\u201d option more extensively. Removing the requirement of loan-level reporting for granular transactions, and instead allowing for aggregate reporting was also favoured. Some replies called for greater flexibility in the required format, e.g. allowing disclosure in Excel format (rather than .xml). To meet the information needs of investors allowing the inclusion of additional data would also be welcomed. Some respondents pointed also to the benefits of alignment and data sharing between authorities (ECB, NCAs) for the reporting entities.\n\nMost respondents, however, refrained from estimating the quantitative effects on the costs of the preferred option as they would depend on concrete details of the proposed change. Of the few replies received, most respondents envisaged \u201cminor\u201d or \u201cmoderate\u201d costs, mainly as the bulk of the costs has been already incurred in the implementation of the existing templates. A change as in Option 1.1 of keeping the templates while increasing the flexibility could lead to moderate one-off IT adjustment costs and a reduction of on-going reporting costs of up to 15%-25% (with an average value of 22.5%). Applied to the currently estimated EUR 120 million annually, this could correspond to a cost saving of EUR 26 million annually.\n\nThe securitisation repositories estimate the adjustment costs for the described adaptation to about EUR 50\u00a0000-70\u00a0000. If we assume that the approx. 3 3 0 \u00a0active issuers have comparable cost and adding a margin of conservatism, we estimate about\u00a0EUR 100\u00a0000 per issuer for an IT adaptation\u00a0(there will be smaller players operating without IT infrastructure and larger players with more complex IT systems and changes and assuming that as many existing datapoints will be utilised as possible), we obtain one-off implementation costs of about EUR\u00a033\u00a0million.\n\nFurthermore, the potential requirement of private transactions to report the data (that is already collected today under Article 7) to securitisation repositories, would result in at least approx. EUR 10\u00a0000 p.a., which translates for an estimated market transactions volume of 660 transactions to about EUR 6.6 million or EUR 7 million (rounded).\n\nType of transaction\n\n\t\n\nrepresentative value (by business association), rounded*\n\n\t\n\nEstimated no. outstanding transactions (rounded)**\n\n\t\n\nEstimated market cost (rounded)\n\n\t\n\nEstimated cost savings\n\n\t\n\nSaving\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nEUR\n\n\t\n\n#\n\n\t\n\nEUR\n\n\t\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\n\nEUR\n\n\n\n\nTraditional, non-STS\n\n\t\n\n50 000\n\n\t\n\n820\n\n\t\n\n41 000 000\n\n\t\n\n23%\n\n(N=2:\n\n15-25%;\u00a0\navg. 22.5%)\n\n\t\n\n9 225 000\n\n\n\n\nTraditional, STS\n\n\t\n\n100 000\n\n\t\n\n510\n\n\t\n\n51 000 000\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n11 475 000\n\n\n\n\nSynthetic, non-STS\n\n\t\n\n60 000\n\n\t\n\n100\n\n\t\n\n6 000 000\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n1 350 000\n\n\n\n\nSynthetic, STS\n\n\t\n\n80 000\n\n\t\n\n110\n\n\t\n\n8 800 000\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n1 980 000\n\n\n\n\nCLO\n\n\t\n\n20 000\n\n\t\n\n440\n\n\t\n\n8 800 000\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n1 980 000\n\n\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n\t\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\n\n115 600 000\n\n\t\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\n\n26 010 000\n\n\n\n\nSaving expressed in basis points of market volume (EUR 1 635 billon)\n\n\t\n\n0.2\n\n15.\nSummary\n\nFigure 15: Summary due diligence and transparency costs and impacts of preferred combination of options\n\n\t\n\nDue diligence\n\n\t\n\nTransparency\n\n\n\n\nOne-off costs\n\n\t\n\nEUR 10-15 million\n\n\t\n\nEUR 370 million\n\n\n\n\nImpact preferred option\n\n\t\n\nNo impact estimated (as costs are sunk); for new market entrants costs could go down by 15%-50% depending on the market segment and transaction types covered.\n\n\t\n\nImplementation costs new templates (assuming re-use of existing data fields to a maximum extent):\n\nEUR 33 million\n\n\n\n\nRecurring annual costs\n\n\t\n\nEUR 660 million p.a.\n\n\t\n\nEUR 120 million p.a.\n\n\n\n\nImpact preferred option on recurring costs\n\n\t\n\nSaving of EUR 290 million p.a.\n\n\t\n\nSaving of EUR 26 million annually for simplified reporting\n\nAdditional annual costs of at least EUR 7 million for the reporting of private transactions to securitisation repositories.\n\nFigure 15 above summarises the cost estimations of the operational costs. It is important to note that no clear distinction between Art. 5 and Art. 7 related costs can be drawn as the respondents allocated the economic burden of due diligence duties and costs both to buy- and sell-side parties, while the regulation formally allocates Art. 5 related due diligence duties exclusively to investors and Art. 7 related transparency duties to originators and sponsors. In relative terms, the total recurring operational costs are estimated to about EUR 780 million, which is about 4.8 basis points of the market volume of outstanding assets. The total savings potential that is estimated to EUR 310 million (rounded) corresponds to about 2.0 basis points, which can be decomposed to about 0.8 basis points for sell-side parties (originators/sponsors/original lenders) and 1.2 for buy-side parties (investors). For sell-side parties, the results could be corroborated with the results of a very detailed and comprehensive study performed by the association True Sale International in collaboration with the German Banking association that estimates the annualised savings potential of operational costs for sell-side parties for a large sample of 310 transactions representing a market volume of about EUR 300 billion, to about 0.9 basis points annually. 108 Apart from those pure monetary benefits of regulatory simplification, it is worth noting that stakeholders put strong emphasis also on other aspects of the due diligence and transparency framework such as the barriers-to-entry and time-to-market considerations.\n\n4 - Relevant sustainable development goals 109\n\nFigure 16: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Overview of relevant SDG \u2013 Preferred Option\n\nIV.

Additional bank and insurance-specific data shared by EBA and EIOPA and extracted from banks and insurers\u2019 reporting templates were also used. The analysis also draws on the insights provided by stakeholders in their responses to the Commission\u2019s targeted consultation and various analytical papers on securitisation.\n\nThe 2022 ESA\u2019s Joint Committee report has been developed in response to the Commission\u2019s call for advice (CfA) addressed to the ESAs in October 2021. The CfA has sought the Joint Committee advice on the performance of the rules on capital and liquidity requirements relative to the framework\u2019s original objective of contributing to the revival of the EU securitisation market on a prudent basis. The report consists of two parts: the assessment of the securitisation market performance and appropriateness of the rules for banks on capital (laid down in Part Three Title II Chapter 5 of the CRR) and liquidity (laid down in the LCR delegated regulation), and the review of the securitisation capital framework applicable to (re)insurers (laid down in Solvency II). The report relies on data collected by EBA directly from banks, through the COREP reporting (in particular templates on securitisation are C14.00 and C14.01 where data are collected on a semi-annual frequency.) COREP provides very granular information of securitisations originated by the banking sector and other securitisations in which banks invest in. The reported transactions include public and private traditional securitisations, synthetic securitisations and ABCP transactions, no matter the country to which the underlying assets belong to. Another input to the report was feedback given by the industry to a consultation launched by the Commission on the functioning of the EU securitisation framework in summer 2021. The feedback given by the industry to this consultation has been analysed in depth by the EBA and has informed the response to this CfA. Moreover, an industry roundtable was held at the EBA premises on 30 May 2022.\n\nThe 2020 EBA report on the significant risk transfer in securitisation has been prepared in accordance with the mandate under Articles 244(6) and 245(6) of the CRR. Taking into account the findings of the EBA Discussion Paper on the Significant Risk Transfer in Securitisation published in 2017, as well as further analysis based on the review of the SRT market practices and the supervisory approaches to SRT assessments, the report included a set of detailed recommendations to the European Commission on the harmonisation of significant risk transfer (SRT) assessment practices and processes.\n\nEstimates of operational costs\n\nFor the estimate of operational costs and benefits for due diligence and transparency that are classified as administrative costs in the Better Regulation terminology, the standard cost model (see Tool #58 EU Standard Cost Model of the Better Regulation Toolbox July 2023) has been used. 111 \u00a0\n\nThe Standard Cost Model estimates administrative costs in the following format:\n\nNumber of entities affected\n\n\t\n\nx\n\n\t\n\nFrequency of administrative action\n\n\t\n\nx\n\n\t\n\nTariff per hour\n\n\t\n\nx\n\n\t\n\nTime in hours\n\n\t\n\n+\n\n\t\n\nOut-of pocket expenses\n\nThis simple model does not work however for the complexity of the securitisation market for the following reasons:\n\n1.\nThe recurring operational costs that apply for securitisation transactions are not per entity, but event-triggered, i.e. they apply whenever a transaction is performed\n\n2.\nThe number of transactions is not officially tracked or part of a statistic for the whole European securitisation market, instead volumes of outstanding underlying assets are reported.\n\n3.\nFurthermore, the securitisation market can be decomposed in many types of transactions or dimensions (see Figure 17 below). Ideally, for each dimension that affects the costs significantly, there should be a sample of cost observations and data on the size of the population. However, not for each of the dimensions mentioned by stakeholders as cost-drivers (see Figure 18) market data was available. For example, for this analysis no official statistics were available that decompose the market into primary and secondary market investment, although this dimension has been mentioned as key cost driver of the operational costs linked to recurring due diligence activities.\n\nFigure 17: Dimensions of securitisation transactions\n\nFigure 18: Key cost drivers of regulatory operational costs of securitisations\n\n\t\n\nDue diligence costs\n\n\t\n\nTransparency costs\n\n\n\n\nOne-off costs\n\n\t\n\n\u00b7\nDue diligence standards that were in place prior to the introduction of SECR; higher initial standards required lower adaptation efforts\n\n\t\n\n\u00b7\nNumber of asset classes covered (each asset class needs has specific reporting templates)\n\n\u00b7\nGranularity of underlying assets\n\n\u00b7\nNeed for collection of data that is not available in IT-Systems, e.g. historical data\n\n\n\n\nRecurring costs\n\n\t\n\n\u00b7\nSTS-status\n\n\u00b7\nInteraction of investor with new vs. repeat issuer\n\n\u00b7\nRisk characteristics\n\n\u00b7\nPrimary or secondary market investment\n\n\t\n\n\u00b7\n\nTo account for the specifics of the securitisation market, the following estimation approach has been taken to consider on the one hand to a maximum extent possible the cost drivers and on the other hand the structure of available market data to scale-up the sample obtained in the stakeholder consultation:\n\n(1)\nOne-off costs due diligence:\n\nEstimated number of investors in the market\n\n\t\n\nx\n\n\t\n\nEstimated cost per investor\n\n\u00b7\nEstimate of number of investors: The estimate has been obtained based on data collected by the EBA in its COREP statistics on the number of bank with the role: investor in securitisations, data from AFME on the estimated number of asset managers in the market 112 and numbers of the ECB on the relative shares of different investor types including asset managers, funds, insurance companies, pension funds, supranationals and public development funds for the SRT market 113 and assuming that the shares are similar for the SRT and non-SRT market segments.\u00a0As there is no statistical tracking of securitisation investors, it should be noted that this is an estimation on a best effort basis.\n\n\u00b7\nEstimated cost per investor: As only very few stakeholder replies were available, the one-off diligence costs were based on an estimate provided by AFME as supporting material to the stakeholder consultation.\n\nEstimated number of issuers in the market\n\n\t\n\nx\n\n\t\n\nEstimated cost per issuer\n\n(2)\nOne-off costs transparency\n\n\u00b7\nEstimated number of issuers in the market: The estimated number of issuers in the market is based on the number of active issuers in the public securitisation market that was provided by the European DataWarehouse\u00a0and COREP statistics of the EBA on banks with the role Original lender, Originator or Sponsor of a securitisations.\n\n\u00b7\nEstimated cost per issuer: The one-off costs for transparency were estimated based on the replies received in the stakeholder consultation they are based on the median value that was obtained from 12 individual contributions and 8 contributions of business associations, where the median value of the pooled sample (N=20) coincides with the median value of the contributions of business associations.\n\n(3)\nRecurring costs due diligence\n\nCosts expressed in basis points of the deal amount 114\n\n\t\n\nx\n\n\t\n\nMarket size expressed in outstanding amount of underlying assets\n\n\u00b7\nMarket size expressed in outstanding amount of underlying assets: The market size has been assessed based on AFME data for the public market 115 and on EBA COREP statistics for the private market. More details on the market data can be found in Annex III.\n\n\u00b7\nCosts expressed in basis points of the deal amount: The annual recurring costs have been estimated based on the replies of the stakeholder consultation and several follow-up interviews with the business associations: AFME, IACPM and TrueSale International/The German Banking Association that were accompanied by further supporting materials. If the costs were provided as annual recurring cost per transaction without the transaction size for which the costs have been incurred, they were translated into basis points by assuming the typical transaction size and investment period or average life for the relevant market segment.\n\n(4)\nRecurring costs Transparency:\n\nCosts expressed in annual recurring cost per transaction 116\n\n\t\n\nx\n\n\t\n\nEstimated number of issued transactions for the market\n\n\u00b7\nEstimated number of issued transactions for the market: The estimated number of issued transactions has been estimated by taking the market volume (see Annex III) and dividing it by the average deal size of the relevant market segment, where the deal size has been estimated based on the following sources:\n\n1.\nPublic transaction: European DataWarehouse: average transaction size for data covering approx. 90% of the market volume of outstanding public transactions (ex. CLO and ABCP)\n\n2.\nPrivate transactions: It has been assumed that private traditional transactions have a similar transaction size as public traditional transactions on average. The same has been assumed for private synthetic transactions. 117\n\n3.\nABCP transactions:\u00a0Study performed by TrueSale International in cooperation with the German Banking Association for the private ABCP market. 118 Assumption of a comparable transaction size in the public ABCP market segment.\n\n4.\nCLO transactions: Data published by the Alternative Credit Investor for 2024. 119\n\n(5)\nEstimated cost savings linked to the proposed options\n\n\u00b7\nPotential savings transparency costs: Values obtained in the stakeholder consultation\n\n\u00b7\nPotential savings due diligence costs: Values obtained in the stakeholder consultation\n\nNature of costs and separation of business-as-usual costs from regulatory cost: The standard cost model requires to collect information that links only to the regulatory share of the cost, i.e. the part of the cost that is linked to the regulation and not incurred as part of the business-as-usual costs that the stakeholder would incur anyway even in the absence of the relevant regulation. To give an example, an asset manager that had very sophisticated due diligence procedures in place already before the SECR applied, may have only marginal additional costs to adapt to SECR whereas a new investor without any procedures in place may have higher purely regulation incurred costs. The costs analysed in this section refer to the regulatory, also referred to as incremental share, only.\n\nUsually, the cost estimations provided by stakeholders in the consultation procedure are compared to the initial estimations that were made at the time the regulation has been set-up and impact assessed for the first time. However, in the initial impact assessment for the SECR 120 , such estimations have not been made. Therefore, the estimations of the current cost constitute the starting point for our baseline scenario and will not be further assessed or compared to a previous estimation.\n\nDynamic nature: There were no forecasts available for the securitisation market going forward, therefore a static approach has been taken, i.e. assuming that the volume and structure of the securitisation market stays constant.\n\nFurther details on the operational cost estimations can be found in Annex 3 and the references therein.\n\nAnnex V: Evaluation\n\n1.\nIntroduction\u00a0\n\nThe Securitisation Framework, introduced to revive a safer securitisation market to\u00a0improve the financing of the EU economy (see section 2.1 for more details), entered into force in 2019. It comprises a new Securitisation Regulation, alongside certain provisions in the \u00a0 Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), the Liquidity Coverage Ratio Delegated Regulation (LCR), and the Solvency II (SII) Delegated Regulation .\n\n1.1. Purpose of the evaluation of the Securitisation Framework\n\nThe evaluation covers the period from the entry into application of the Securitisation Framework (1 January 2019) until present. In line with the Better Regulation Toolbox, it examines whether the objectives of the Securitisation Framework were met during the period of its application (effectiveness) and continue to be appropriate (relevance) and whether the Framework, taking account of the costs and benefits associated with applying it, was efficient in achieving its objectives (efficiency). The evaluation also considers whether the Securitisation Framework, as legislation at EU level, provided added value (EU added value) and whether it is consistent with other related pieces of legislation (coherence).\n\nThe evaluation has been conducted in parallel with (\u2018back-to-back\u2019) the impact assessment accompanying the proposal revising the Securitisation Framework. The results of this evaluation have been incorporated in the problem definition of the impact assessment.\n\n1.2. Scope of the evaluation\n\nThe scope of the present evaluation includes the legal framework in its entirety (SECR, relevant parts to the CRR 121 , LCR 122 and SII 123 legislative acts that pertain to securitisation transactions). The geographical scope of the evaluation extends to all EU Member States.\n\n1.3. Description of the methodology\n\nThe evaluation was supported by numerous inputs, including stakeholder consultations, stakeholder meetings and analytical work carried out by the ESAs, as well as other sources. Two targeted consultations were held. The first one 124 in 2021, informed the preparation of the 2022 Commission Report 125 on the functioning of the SECR. A more recent targeted consultation 126 on the functioning of the EU securitisation framework (hereafter \u2018the targeted consultation\u2019) was launched in October 2024. The targeted consultation sought stakeholders\u2019 feedback on a broad range of issues, including the effectiveness and scope of application of the existing framework, supervisory issues, the STS standard, the possible introduction of a securitisation platform(s), non-prudential aspects including transparency and due diligence requirements, and prudential issues for banks, insurers, and IORPs/pension funds. Following an 8-week consultation period, the targeted consultation received 133 responses 127 from a variety of stakeholders, mostly representing industry (associations and individual market participants) and supervisors. DG FISMA analysed the submitted responses, which informed both this evaluation and the forward-looking impact assessment 128 . In addition, DG FISMA held many bilateral and multilateral meetings with stakeholders and organised a workshop with market participants in 2024.\n\nThis evaluation also benefits from the analytical work undertaken by the ESAs. In particular, it takes into account the 2021 Joint Committee report on the implementation and functioning of the SECR 129 , which focused on the implementation of the general requirements applicable to securitisations, including the risk retention, due-diligence and transparency requirements as well as on the specific requirements related to STS securitisations. The Joint Committee has been working on its second report due for publication by early 2025 130 . The expert discussions that took place in the preparation and drafting of this document have also informed the evaluation. This evaluation also draws from the findings of the ESAs opinion on the jurisdictional scope of the SECR 131 and the compliance challenges that such jurisdictional scope posed for market participants.\n\nAnother input to the evaluation has been the ESAs\u2019 Joint Committee advice on the review of the securitisation prudential framework 132 , published in December 2022 in response to the call for advice from the European Commission of October 2021. The Joint Committee report assesses the recent performance of the rules on capital requirements (for banks, insurance and reinsurance undertakings) and liquidity requirements (for banks) with respect to the framework\u2019s original objective of contributing to the sound revival of the EU securitisation framework. The findings of the EBA report on the significant risk transfer in securitisation published in November 2020 133 \u00a0have also contributed to the evaluation.\n\nFinally, the evaluation draws on the insights from the 2022 European Systemic Risk Board\u2019 report \u201cMonitoring systemic risks in the EU securitisation market\u201d 134 on the financial stability implications of the EU securitisation market.\n\n1.4. Limitations and robustness of the methodology\n\nThe analysis of the performance of the Framework comes with limitations and uncertainties.\n\nFirst, the reporting of EU securitisation market transactions to an official securitisation repository is limited to public transactions (i.e. transactions for which\u00a0a prospectus in compliance with Directive 2003/71/EC has been issued). By contrast, private transactions are under no obligation to report to a repository and are often conducted directly between the parties undertaking the securitisation without public announcement. As a result, it is challenging to obtain a comprehensive view of the EU securitisation market's size and scope. To address this data limitation, estimates of the private securitisation market have been derived from various alternative sources, including supervisory reporting 135 and market estimates by industry associations. By combining these data points, a more accurate picture of the EU securitisation market can be obtained.\u00a0It is not possible to empirically assess the effectiveness of previous measures in reducing operational costs since quantitative information on operational costs was not collected in the previous impact assessment.\n\nSecond, drawing causal links between the implementation of the EU securitisation framework and the subsequent market developments is a complex task. This is due to the multifaceted nature of the framework, which has undergone various updates over the years, making it challenging to isolate the specific impact of each change. The interpretation is all the more challenging due to the overlap of the framework implementation and the Covid-19 pandemic, which can act as a confounding factor.\n\nFurthermore, the framework's interaction with other regulatory and economic factors, makes it difficult to determine the framework's unique contribution. Additionally, the time lag between the implementation of a regulatory change and the observed market reaction can be significant, which may lead to attribution errors and obscure causal relationships. As a result, any attempts to draw causal links between the EU securitisation framework and market developments must be approached with caution to avoid over-simplification or misattribution of causality.\n\nThirdly, some of the objectives of the intervention, such as the removal of stigma from investors, increasing market standardisation or tackling regulatory inconsistencies, are not precisely defined and are not directly measurable. Therefore, the evaluation relies on the responses to the targeted consultation to gauge stakeholders\u2019 views with respect to the attainment of these objectives. However, responses should be interpreted with caution as respondents may have a different understanding of what a given policy objective means.\n\n2.\nWhat was the expected outcome of the intervention?\n\n2.1. Description of the intervention and its objectives\n\nBefore the introduction of the Securitisation Framework, the EU securitisation market was suffering from the following main problems (see 2015 Impact Assessment 136 for more details). First, during the GFC complex and opaque securitisations led to severe losses for investors. The resulting lingering stigma attached to securitisation products has been reflected in subdued investor demand. These practices and the subsequent high losses were, however, mostly limited to securitisations originated in the US market. Second, insufficient risk-sensitivity (i.e. the pre-2019 framework applied the same capital requirements for all types of transactions, regardless of their complexity or level of transparency in the regulatory framework disadvantaged simple and transparent securitisation products. Third, a lack of consistency and standardisation across legislation led to high operational costs for investors and issuers. The Securitisation Framework was created to address these key problems/needs.\n\nIts general objective was the revival of a safer EU securitisation market that would improve the financing of the EU economy, weakening the possible link between banks\u2019 deleveraging needs and credit tightening in the short run, and creating a more balanced and stable funding structure of the EU economy in the long run.\n\nTo achieve this general objective, the 2015 Impact Assessment identified three specific objectives:\n\n\u00b7\nRemove stigma towards securitisation;\n\n\u00b7\nRemove regulatory disadvantages for simple and transparent securitisation (STS) products;\n\n\u00b7\nReduce/eliminate unduly high operational costs for issuers and investors.\n\nTo achieve these objectives the Securitisation Framework (input) was adopted: the SECR defined (i) disclosure, (ii) due diligence and (iii) risk retention rules for all EU securitisations, (iv) introduced specific criteria to identify simple, transparent and standardised securitisation (STS), and (v) banned re-securitisations. In addition, more risk sensitivity was introduced in the prudential frameworks for banks (in the CRR) and insurers for STS securitisations (SII Delegated Regulation).\n\nThe Securitisation Framework was expected to achieve the following outputs:\n\n\u00b7\nDifferentiate simple, transparent and standardised securitisation products from more opaque and complex ones;\n\n\u00b7\nSupport standardisation in the market;\n\n\u00b7\nRemove regulatory inconsistencies in the treatment of securitisations.\n\nThe implementation of the inputs and achievement of the outputs mentioned above were expected to have the following results: first, increased supply of STS securitisations in comparison to non-STS securitisations \u2013 with a growth rate expected to be higher for STS products than for non-STS products. Second, higher prices 137 of STS vs. non-STS products due to their increased attractiveness for investors. Third, standardised marketing and reporting material. Finally, a reduction of unduly high costs for issuers and investors. These results should have ultimately had long-term impacts in the form of increased investor trust in securitisation products (particularly STS), and in promoting securitisation as an improved financing channel for the economy. To measure these results, the 2015 Impact Assessment identified the following indicators: 1) STS products' price and issuance, 2) the degree of standardisation of marketing and reporting material and 3) feedback from market practitioners on operational costs' evolution.\u00a0\n\nWhen assessing the framework, it is important to keep in mind that there are several external factors outside the remit of the Framework that also influenced the performance of the EU intervention. These include monetary policy, the level of interest rates, Brexit, the level of demand for credit in the economy and developments on the supply side regarding alternative funding channels (i.e. covered bonds, non-bank lending, unsecured credit, etc.). By injecting liquidity into the economy at a very low price, loose monetary policy can make wholesale funding in general, and securitisation in particular, less competitive and attractive. The ECB launched its ABS purchase programme in 2014, to further enhance the transmission of monetary policy (as of July 2023, it has stopped conducting further direct purchases). While a low interest rate could also support securitisation activity by inducing banks to take on more risk in general 138 ,\u00a0banks could rely more on traditional funding sources and therefore reduce their securitisation activities 139 . In such low-interest rate environment, securitisation - a relatively complex and less accessible instrument - is one of the first ones to be crowded out by cheaper and easier to access alternatives. The impact of Brexit on the EU securitisation market was expected to be negative since it involved the fragmentation of a previously harmonised market, and therefore it resulted in additional regulatory costs for market participants 140 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2. Intervention Logic: EU Securitisation Framework\n\n\n\n\n2.3. Description of the situation before the intervention\n\nThe present evaluation assesses the Securitisation Framework against the baseline scenario included in the Impact Assessment 141 accompanying the proposal on the EU securitisation framework in September 2015.\n\n2.3.1. Non-prudential rules\n\nPrior to the introduction of the SECR, non-prudential rules for securitisations were scattered across different sectoral legislations. These legislations included the CRR for banks, the SII Directive and Delegated Regulation for insurers and reinsurers, and the UCITS and AIFMD Directives for asset managers. Legal provisions on information disclosure and transparency were also laid down in the Credit Rating Agency Regulation (CRAIII) and in the Prospectus Directive.\u00a0The 2015 Impact Assessment concluded that inconsistencies regarding originators\u2019 disclosure and investors\u2019 due diligence requirements, as highlighted by the ESAs Joint Committee, resulted in overlaps and inconsistencies across different financial services regulations and sometimes within the same sector 142 .\u00a0\n\nThis patchwork of rules was deemed to be too costly and did not ensure a level playing field. Greater consistency in the regulatory framework and standardisation of EU securitisations was expected to increase legal clarity and comparability across asset classes, ease investors\u2019 assessments, facilitate issuance, and reduce issuance costs for originators. In addition, greater standardisation of the instruments was expected to increase market liquidity and help the development of secondary markets 143 .\u00a0As such, the 2015 Impact Assessment proposed a unified legislative framework for non-prudential securitisation provisions \u2013 the Securitisation Regulation \u2013 with the aim of simplifying and standardising the regulatory environment. Greater consistency was also expected to help supervisory authorities to monitor macro-prudential risks and the risk profile of financial intermediaries.\n\n2.3.2. Banking prudential rules\n\nThe CRR sets out detailed rules on how to calculate the capital requirements for banks\u2019 securitisation exposures, whether as originator (for the securitisation positions the bank retains), investor (for the securitisation positions that bank invests in) or sponsor (for the securitisation positions the bank is exposed to as sponsor).\n\nPrior to the introduction of the Securitisation Framework in 2019, there was no STS standard. Capital requirements for all securitisations, including those that would be considered as STS under the current framework, were generally lower than those under the current regime.\n\nIn addition, the calculation of bank capital requirements for securitisation positions was heavily reliant on external credit ratings. The framework did not sufficiently consider the relative complexities of the structural features of the transactions, which were not always properly reflected in the external ratings and hence also not in the resulting capital requirements for those securitisations. In this vein, the 2015 Impact Assessment noted that the securitisation capital framework in the CRR did not adequately address the risks that materialised during the GFC, in particular for complex securitisations that were originated in the US. Also, the absence of a clear regulatory distinction between STS and non-STS transactions made it more difficult for investors to identify simple and transparent transactions that performed strongly compared to more complex transactions. This lack of differentiation contributed to the investor stigma associated with all types of securitisation 144 .\n\nThe 2015 Impact Assessment therefore recommended to increase the capital charges for more complex securitisations to address supervisors\u2019 concerns regarding the insufficient conservativeness of the capital treatment for such securitisations. It also recommended to develop a preferential capital treatment for the new class of simple securitisations (STS) compared to non-STS securitisations.\n\nIn particular, the new Securitisation Framework provided that transactions that are compliant with both the STS criteria (which focus on capturing and mitigating the major drivers of risk of a securitisation related to modelling and agency risks, as revealed during the GFC) and the additional criteria specified in the CRR (which focus on the minimum credit quality of the underlying exposures) benefit from preferential capital treatment.\n\nAnother core element of the securitisation prudential framework are the rules on \u2018significant risk transfer\u2019 (SRT). SRT refers to a process where a bank transfers a substantial portion of credit risk associated with a portfolio of assets to external investors. This transfer of risk allows the bank to reduce the capital requirement linked to those assets. To qualify for SRT, the transfer must meet specific CRR-specified criteria, ensuring that the risk transfer is sufficient and genuine. The EU has had a comprehensive SRT framework in place since 2006, according to which the competent authorities assess the compliance of individual securities transactions against quantitative tests and qualitative criteria. If approved, the bank benefits from lower capital requirements, improving its balance sheet and lending capacity. The Securitisation Framework under assessment introduced no substantial changes to these rules, compared to the previous regime.\n\nFinally, the LCR Delegated Act sets out how securitised assets are to be classified and treated for liquidity purposes. It requires banks to hold sufficient liquid assets (High-Quality Liquid Assets, or HQLA) in the form of a \u201cbuffer\u201d that can be sold quickly for cash, if needed. This aims to ensure banks can withstand short-term stress scenarios while maintaining access to funding. To support diversification within the liquidity buffers of banks and to facilitate the financing of the real economy, the LCR Delegated Act expanded the list of HQLA (i.e. assets eligible in the liquidity buffers), beyond Residential Mortgage-Based Securities (RMBS) (which are included in Basel standards), to certain other forms of securitisation, namely those backed by auto loans, consumer credit and SME loans. Before the adoption of the framework, there was no differentiation between simple and complex transactions and both types of securitisations were eligible for the LCR liquidity buffer. The framework clarified that only STS securitisation of high credit quality can be included in the banks\u2019 liquidity buffers, thereby limiting the use of securitisations for the liquidity buffer.\n\n2.3.3. Insurance prudential rules\n\nInsurance companies are subject to the SII Directive 145 and the SII Delegated Regulation 146 , which regulate how much capital insurers should set aside to cater for the risks arising from their investment activities 147 . Prior to the initiative, SII included standard formula capital requirements for securitisation investments. These capital requirements distinguished simple securitisations (so-called \u2018type 1\u2019, following a logic like the one underlying the later introduction of the STS category) from other securitisations (\u2018type 2\u2019) which were subject to higher capital requirements 148 .\n\nThe 2015 Impact Assessment\u00a0concluded that substantial differences between the capital treatment of banks and insurance companies investing in the same product were documented and suggested greater convergence 149 . \u00a0\n\nTo enhance the coherence of the capital treatment for banks and insurers, as well as to better differentiate simple and transparent transactions from more complex and opaque ones, the 2015 Assessment recommended to update SII to reflect the introduction of the newly created STS standard and to introduce preferential capital charges for STS securitisations. These would be differentiated between \u2018senior\u2019 and \u2018non-senior\u2019 tranches 150 to address the concern that if insurers only invest in senior STS tranches, this may not be enough to stimulate the development of STS securitisation deals. This differentiation between \u2018senior\u2019 and \u2018non-senior\u2019 tranches has made the framework more risk sensitive in a way that riskier (i.e. non-senior) tranches can attract a higher capital charge than less risky (more senior) ones.\n\n3.\nHow has the situation evolved over the evaluation period?\u00a0\n\n3.1. Current state of play\n\nThe following section presents the changes introduced by the Securitisation Framework.\n\n3.1.1 Securitisation Regulation\n\nAs explained in Section 2, the SECR built on several provisions that were scattered across various sectoral legal acts that applied to different market entities. It defined (i) disclosure obligations for the issuers of securitisations, (ii) due diligence obligations for investors, (iii) risk retention rules for all EU securitisations, (iv) introduced specific criteria to identify simple, transparent and standardised securitisation (STS), and (v) banned re-securitisations. It created a single and harmonised legal framework directly applicable to the main parties involved in a securitisation transaction. This framework also includes regulatory and implementing technical standards and supervisory guidelines\u00a0(see\u00a0Table 2 at the end of this section).\u00a0In addition, it introduced a common set of reporting templates for both private and public securitisations and ESMA was tasked with the development of Regulatory Technical Standards to specify precise information and formats for these disclosures. Over time, ESMA has continued to review and refine these templates 151 .\n\nBuilding on the practice of disclosure of derivative transactions, the SECR established securitisation repositories to serve as centralised hubs for information on public securitisations, making it easier for investors and supervisors to access information. Since the entry into force of the SECR, two entities have been registered as securitisation repositories for the European Union: European DataWarehouse GmbH (based in Germany), and SecRep B.V. (based in the Netherlands) 152 .\n\nThe pre-existing risk-retention requirement, which was designed to ensure that issuers retain a sufficient economic interest in a securitisation, was kept in substance but extended in scope. The Securitisation Regulation requires not only that investors verify that the securitisation positions they hold comply with risk retention (the pre-existing indirect approach), but also directly requires all EU issuers to apply risk retention to the securitisations they issue. This helps to prevent excessive risk-taking and promotes more responsible securitisation practices.\n\nDrawing heavily on the work of the international supervisory community, the SECR created the STS standard for a new class of high-quality securitisations. This standard allows investors to easily distinguish between simple and transparent securitisations and more complex ones.\n\nTo facilitate assessment of compliance with the STS criteria, the SECR provided for Third-Party Verifiers (TPVs). These independent entities verify that a securitisation meets the STS requirements, providing an additional layer of assurance and trust in the market. To operate as a TPV, an entity must obtain authorisation from ESMA - two such entities have been authorised to date: PCS Europe ASBL, and STS Verification International GmbH. Most STS transactions have used the services of one of these entities 153 .\u00a0\n\nFinally, the SECR introduced a ban on re-securitisation, subject to a limited set of exceptions. This ban is intended to prevent the creation of complex and opaque financial instruments, which can be very susceptible to changes in market conditions, making them difficult to value and manage. The ban has been consistently enforced and there does not appear to be any notable re-securitisation activity on the European market since entry into force of the Framework.\n\nOne of objectives of these regulatory requirements was to address and mitigate the specific risks that may result due to the structuring process of a securitisation, notably the agency and model risks. Agency risk results from the information asymmetry and the potential misalignment of interests between the originator and the investor in a securitisation, whereby the investor, unlike the originator, may have limited knowledge and understanding of the underlying portfolio. This misalignment of interest or information asymmetry can lead to poor outcomes. Model risk arises when the financial models used to predict cash flows at the portfolio level or the assumptions underpinning the tranching of the credit risk under these models are wrong or inaccurate. In such a scenario, the securitised product could turn out riskier than expected.\n\nThe SECR was first amended in 2021 154 as part of the effort\u00a0to help the EU economy to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The amendments\u00a0expanded the scope of the STS regime to on-balance-sheet synthetic securitisations and removed certain regulatory impediments to the securitisation of non-performing loans.\n\nMore than three years after the entry into application of the Securitisation Framework, in line with the legal mandate under Article 46 of the SECR, the Commission adopted a report taking stock of the development of the market in 2022. The report highlighted that while the SECR seemed to have positively contributed to achieving its original objectives, there were issues in certain areas where problems were observed (e.g. disclosure, due diligence, prudential treatment) and concluded that more time was needed to get a full picture of the impact of the new Securitisation Framework in light of the new elements added in April 2021. The report also provided guidance on some aspects of the legal framework.\n\nIn 2024, a dedicated regime for green securitisations was introduced as part of the EUGBS, following the recommendations of a report from the EBA 155 . The EUGBS, applicable as of December 2024, focuses on the use of proceeds arising from the issue of the bonds, with a view to ensure that these proceeds are used towards a sustainable activity within the meaning of the Taxonomy Regulation. The EUGBS introduces a voluntary standard that provides a specific legal framework for bonds that want to be labelled as green. To qualify as a EUGBS securitisation bond, the bond\u2019s originator must use the proceeds from the issue of the securitisation bond to refinancing or financing of Taxonomy-aligned assets and the securitised exposures must comply with minimum sustainability requirement. For the moment, synthetics securitisations are excluded from the scope.\n\nSince the SECR is a binding legal act that must be applied in its entirety across the EU, no transposition issues have arisen. That being said, the regulation\u2019s application has suffered of a lack of supervisory convergence. According to the findings from the peer review carried out by ESMA for the supervision of STS transactions in 2024 156 , there are different supervisory practices affecting the sound and consistent level of supervision. Moreover, there have been delays in the designation of the supervisor by some countries despite the entry into force of the regulation more than five years ago but the situation is on track now. The 2022 Report on the functioning of the SECR reported feedback from some market participants about differences in the supervisory approaches of Member States and also flagged that greater convergence and better coordination between supervisors would be beneficial.\n\nTable 2: List of mandates for regulatory technical standards, Implementing technical standards, Delegated Regulation or Guidelines in the Securitisation Regulation\n\nType of Act: Regulatory technical standard (RTS), Implementing technical standard (ITS), Delegated Regulation (DR) or Guidelines (GL)\n\n\t\n\nShort name\n\n\n\n\nRTS\n\n\t\n\nAuthorisation of third-party verifiers of STS transactions\n\n\n\n\nRTS\n\n\t\n\nHomogeneity of underlying exposures\n\n\n\n\nRTS\n\n\t\n\nTransparency requirements\n\n\n\n\nRTS\n\n\t\n\nSTS notification\n\n\n\n\nRTS\n\n\t\n\nRegistration of securitisation repositories\n\n\n\n\nRTS\n\n\t\n\nOperational guidelines for securitisation repositories\n\n\n\n\nRTS\n\n\t\n\nCooperation and exchange of information between National Competent Authorities and the ESAs\n\n\n\n\nDR\n\n\t\n\nFees to be charged by ESMA to securitisation repositories\n\n\n\n\nRTS\n\n\t\n\nRisk retention\n\n\n\n\nRTS\n\n\t\n\nDisclosure of principal adverse impacts\n\n\n\n\nRTS\n\n\t\n\nSpecification of the performance-related triggers\n\n\n\n\nGL\n\n\t\n\nSTS criteria\n\n\n\n\nGL\n\n\t\n\nPortability of Information between Securitisation Repositories\n\n\n\n\nGL\n\n\t\n\nData completeness and consistency thresholds\n\n3.1.2. Capital requirements for banks\n\nThe current prudential securitisation framework for banks (set out in the CRR) implements the Basel III securitisation framework 157 and introduced significant changes relative to the previous framework. It aimed to address the weaknesses that were revealed during the GFC. As a result of the amendments, the prudential framework is now simpler, more risk sensitive, more prudently calibrated and more consistent with the underlying credit risk framework.\n\nIn terms of risk sensitivity and prudence, the intervention significantly increased capital requirements for banks\u2019 securitisation exposures compared to the previous regime: as a measure of prudence a considerable level of overcapitalisation was introduced, to address the agency and model risks inherent to securitisation transactions.\n\nMore specifically, there are two correction factors in the CRR capital framework that safeguard and ensure the capital \u2018non-neutrality\u2019 158 , of the framework: (i) a risk weight floor for exposures to the senior tranche \u2013 which defines an absolute minimum risk weight for banks\u2019 exposures to the senior tranche of securitisation; and (ii) a (p) factor (\u2018penalty factor\u2019) which defines the relative capital surcharge for all securitisation exposures, compared to the capital requirement for the underlying pool of exposures. Each bank needs to reflect the risk weight floor and the (p) factor in the calculation of the minimum capital requirement that applies to their securitisation exposures.\n\nThe current framework allows securitisations, that comply with the STS criteria and with some additional specific requirements to minimise credit risk of the underlying exposures, to be eligible for a more favourable capital treatment compared to non-STS securitisations. At the same time, the capital requirements for STS are still generally higher than capital requirements applied to comparable transactions under the previous regime.\n\nOther significant revisions with respect to the previous framework relate to changes in the so-called \u2018hierarchy of approaches\u2019 that banks must use for calculating capital requirements for their securitisation exposures 159 . The new framework reduced complexity by reducing the number of the approaches allowed for determining capital charges, reduced mechanistic reliance on external ratings and improved the overall calibration of the capital requirements. Additionally, the framework revised the risk drivers used in each approach \u2013 the calculation of capital requirements is now more risk sensitive and allows to capture some of the risk drivers not reflected in the previous framework.\n\n3.1.3. Liquidity requirements for banks\n\nThe liquidity requirements for banks securitisations specified in the LCR Delegated Act implement the Basel III international standards that the EU agreed to implement as part of the wide-ranging reform of the prudential framework for banks. Only STS securitisations are currently eligible to qualify as HQLA under the LCR Delegated Act.\n\n3.1.4. Solvency II / insurance prudential rules\n\nIn line with the preferred policy option of the latest impact assessment, differentiated capital requirements for senior STS and non-senior STS securitisations were introduced, replacing the existing \u2018type 1\u2019 securitisation capital charges. Under the new framework, such capital charges depend on credit quality (rating) and duration of the asset. Finally, transitional arrangements were introduced to ensure that insurers holding \u2018type 1\u2019 securitisations would not be subject to a significant increase in capital requirements if such investments did not meet the newly introduced STS criteria. As a result, capital requirements for senior STS securitisation are two to three times lower than former type 1 capital requirements, and non-senior STS capital requirements are broadly comparable to the former type 1 capital requirements. By contrast, capital requirements for \u2018type 2\u2019 securitisations (now called \u2018non-STS\u2019 securitisations) were not amended and remain applicable.\n\n3.2. Market context \u00a0\n\nThe market is gradually growing but continues to operate below its potential when looking at the limited share of placed traditional securitisation and limited investor base, as well as in comparison with other major jurisdictions. The geographical distribution of the EU securitisation market is uneven, and banks in many Member States prefer alternative instruments, such as covered bonds.\n\nWhile we estimate the combined EU public and private market to at least EUR 1.6 trillion by the end of 2023 160 , we focus in the following on the part of the EU market where banks are involved as issuers (originators or sponsors or original lenders) or as investors. 161 \u00a0This part of the EU securitisation market stood at approximately EUR 1.2 trillion in terms of outstanding volumes at the end of 2023 (see Figure 1). It is composed of 68% traditional, 25% synthetic and 7% asset-backed commercial paper securitisations. There has been a change of composition in recent years, with the share of traditional securitisation decreasing from 77% in the first half of 2020, mainly as a result of an expanding share of synthetic securitisation.\n\nFigure 1: Outstanding volumes of transactions by type \n\nSource: EBA COREP, S1 refers to the first half of the year. S2 refers to the second half of the year.\n\nLooking at the composition of securitised exposures, the most commonly securitised asset class is corporate loans (see Figure 2 ). This reflects the ongoing change in market composition from traditional to synthetic securitisation, as well as the rise in collateralised loan obligations 162 . Corporate loans make up nearly 80% of the assets securitised in synthetic transactions, compared to about 25% in traditional securitisations.\n\nAt the same time, the share of residential mortgage-backed securities, formerly the dominant asset class in the EU and by far the most commonly securitised asset in other jurisdictions, shrank from 46% in the first half of 2020 to 33% by end 2023 and remains in second place.\n\nFigure 2: Outstanding volumes of transactions by asset class \n\nSource: EBA COREP\n\nWhile the public EU securitisation market remains significantly below its peak in 2008-2009 (~EUR 2trn outstanding volume), it shows signs of gradual recovery. Following the entry into force of the new Securitisation Framework in 2019, in particular the outstanding balance of EU securitisations with bank involvement 163 has gradually increased from under EUR 800 billion to the level of EUR 1.2 trillion at year-end 2023, while average annual issuance in the period 2020 \u2013 2023 amounted to EUR 218.25bn (see Figure 3 ).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFigure 3: Total issuance by type of securitisation (EUR bn)\n\n \u00a0Source: EBA COREP\n\nDespite recent market growth, a significant portion of the traditional securitisation transactions remains retained on the balance sheets of the issuing banks rather than placed on the market with external investors 164 . This means that the bank retains (most of) the securitisation tranches that it issues (and it is the main investor in its own securitisation). Retained traditional securitisations are used primarily to obtain funding, i.e. the senior tranche is used as collateral to obtain liquidity from the ECB. Securitisation is an attractive tool for this purpose because the\u00a0senior securitisation notes are eligible collateral for the ECB\u2019s liquidity operations, whereas the underlying pools of loans are not eligible. According to the ECB\u2019s database, asset-backed securities represented 19% of the use of collateral and outstanding credit for liquidity operations in the last quarter of 2024 and has the highest utilisation rate among all types of eligible assets, i.e. 46.9% of the eligible asset-backed securities were used as collateral.\n\nThis is also evident in the persistently low rates of placements (see Figure 4 ).\u00a0Banks\u2019 retention levels differ for each securitisation type: banks have retained more than 80% of the SME securitisations and more than 70% of RMBSs in Q3 2023; in case of other types of securitisations half of the tranches are still sold to the market.\n\nFigure 4: Share of placed vs retained traditional securitisation (left) and share of outstanding EU securitisation that is retained by banks and that qualifies as STS, Q3 2023 (right)\n\n  \u00a0\n\nSource: Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) (left) and Bloomberg and ECB calculations (right)\u00a0\n\nNot placing the tranches with external investors prevents the originating banks from transferring risk and achieving capital relief and hence limits their ability to free up their balance sheets and redeploy released capital and deepen capital markets.\n\nThe limited use of traditional securitisations for capital relief purposes can also be observed in the composition of SRT transactions (see Figure 5 below). Securitisation allows the originating banks to achieve capital relief and free up their balance sheets for further lending on the condition that the securitisation complies with SRT rules in the CRR, i.e. a significant amount of risk associated with the underlying pool of assets is transferred to external investors. A substantial majority of SRT transactions are synthetic transactions. For the traditional securitisation market segment, the share of traditional securitisations that achieve SRT is about 20% of the outstanding volume as traditional securitisations, and 37% of the outstanding volume of EU SRT transactions in general, as of end 2023 (taking into account that the traditional securitisations tend to be used primarily for funding purposes).\n\nFigure 5: Outstanding volumes of all types of transactions by SRT (bn euro, 2023-S2) \n\nSource: EBA COREP\n\nThe narrow investor base (i.e. the number of investors typically involved in one transaction) in the EU limits the capacity of banks to place their securitisations on the market and results in a limited capacity to absorb increased supply. Typically,\u00a0about\u00a030-50 investors are involved in a public traditional transaction, 15-25 investors in a\u00a0collateralised loan obligations transaction 165 and 1-3 sponsors\u00a0in an asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) securitisation. For synthetic securitisations, the typical investor base is between 1-3 investors (smaller than for traditional securitisations, reflecting primarily the private nature of these transactions) 166 . Typically, the type of investors involved in senior tranches in traditional securitisations in the EU are banks and asset managers seeking low-risk and highly liquid investment products. By contrast, investors in junior tranches usually look for higher yield. Similarly, the investors in synthetic transactions differ from those in traditional ones. Investors in synthetic securitisations are institutions specialised in assessing credit risk, typically specialised funds, asset managers, insurance and pension companies or supranational institutions, that often seek to establish a longer-term relationship with the originating bank in view of the more demanding due diligence required. 167 Banks are typically not directly investing in synthetic securitisations.\n\nThe EU investor base is much smaller than the one in the US, with about 80-115 investors in total. 168 The investor base for EU securitisations is also much smaller than for other EU fixed income instruments, such as investment grade corporate bonds and covered bonds, with an average of 80-115 investors alone per bond 169 . Market data points to a particularly narrow investor base for senior (i.e. the best quality) tranches of traditional securitisation instruments, which hinders the ability of issuers to place these traditional securitisation transactions with external investors.\u00a0\n\nAs a result of the characteristics described above, securitisation currently plays a limited role in the EU economy. Despite its recent growth, securitisation issuance as a percentage of GDP remains much lower in the EU than in other major jurisdictions (see Figure 6 ). For the US, we use figures which exclude the market supported by Government-Supported Entities, such as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which represents the largest part of the US securitisation market. The exclusion of this segment of the US market makes the data more comparable to the EU securitisation market, where publicly guaranteed securitisation plays a much less prominent role.\n\nFigure 6: International securitisation issuance as a proportion of GDP (2024H1 vs 5Y and 10Y average, %)\n\n\u00a0  \u00a0\n\nSource: AFME Capital Markets Union Key Performance Indicators \u2013 7th edition (November 2024). US and Australian volumes include ABS, RMBS, CMBS and CDO.\u00a0\n\nMoreover, the EU securitisation market is highly concentrated, with 80% of securitisation issuances concentrated in five Member States (Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain). Several reasons can explain this high degree of concentration in those Member States, such as:\n\nI.\nthe existence of a stronger institutional originator and investor base and market depth, which creates the necessary conditions to make securitisation more cost-efficient,\n\nII.\nmore developed mortgage markets which provide banks with a sufficiently large homogenous asset class to securitise,\n\nIII.\nthe existence of public guarantee schemes, e.g. GACS in Italy, which incentivises securitisation of non-performing loans, and\n\nIV.\nlegacy of past financial crises that shaped market developments.\n\nFor example, Italy and Spain saw increased securitisation activity following the sovereign debt crisis, as banks sought alternative funding channels. \u00a0The table below shows the location of the securitised loans. Securitisation has a wider footprint in terms of jurisdictions than the table below might suggest. For instance, Irish and Luxembourgish securitisation special purpose entities account for nearly half of the total securitised assets in the Euro Area even though the table below shows modest securitisation markets in those Member States. While the securitised loans might be originated in one Member State, other key services necessary for the securitisation transaction to take place, such as legal advisory, corporate service providers, auditors, administrators and trustees might be provided in another Member State.\n\nTable 3: Breakdown of the securitised assets by Member State, end-2023\n\nJurisdiction\n\n\t\n\nAmount (bn euro)\n\n\t\n\nPercentage of total\n\n\n\n\nAustria\n\n\t\n\n20\n\n\t\n\n1.70%\n\n\n\n\nBelgium\n\n\t\n\n47\n\n\t\n\n3.95%\n\n\n\n\nBulgaria\n\n\t\n\n1\n\n\t\n\n0.12%\n\n\n\n\nCroatia\n\n\t\n\n1\n\n\t\n\n0.09%\n\n\n\n\nCyprus\n\n\t\n\n5\n\n\t\n\n0.45%\n\n\n\n\nCzechia\n\n\t\n\n2\n\n\t\n\n0.17%\n\n\n\n\nDenmark\n\n\t\n\n6\n\n\t\n\n0.54%\n\n\n\n\nEstonia\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\t\n\n0.00%\n\n\n\n\nFinland\n\n\t\n\n5\n\n\t\n\n0.38%\n\n\n\n\nFrance\n\n\t\n\n244\n\n\t\n\n20.30%\n\n\n\n\nGermany\n\n\t\n\n195\n\n\t\n\n16.28%\n\n\n\n\nGreece\n\n\t\n\n64\n\n\t\n\n5.33%\n\n\n\n\nHungary\n\n\t\n\n1\n\n\t\n\n0.05%\n\n\n\n\nIreland\n\n\t\n\n22\n\n\t\n\n1.80%\n\n\n\n\nItaly\n\n\t\n\n282\n\n\t\n\n23.48%\n\n\n\n\nLatvia\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\t\n\n0.03%\n\n\n\n\nLithuania\n\n\t\n\n1\n\n\t\n\n0.05%\n\n\n\n\nLuxembourg\n\n\t\n\n9\n\n\t\n\n0.77%\n\n\n\n\nMalta\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\t\n\n0.01%\n\n\n\n\nNetherlands\n\n\t\n\n128\n\n\t\n\n10.64%\n\n\n\n\nPoland\n\n\t\n\n12\n\n\t\n\n0.96%\n\n\n\n\nPortugal\n\n\t\n\n18\n\n\t\n\n1.50%\n\n\n\n\nRomania\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\t\n\n0.03%\n\n\n\n\nSlovakia\n\n\t\n\n1\n\n\t\n\n0.04%\n\n\n\n\nSlovenia\n\n\t\n\n0\n\n\t\n\n0.00%\n\n\n\n\nSpain\n\n\t\n\n132\n\n\t\n\n11.00%\n\n\n\n\nSweden\n\n\t\n\n4\n\n\t\n\n0.32%\n\n\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n\t\n\n1,200\n\n\t\n\n100.00%\n\nNote: Whenever there are more countries of origination, only the major one shall be reported. Therefore, the breakdown may be biased in that some EU countries may not be captured.\n\n4.\nEvaluation findings\u00a0\n\nThe evaluation of the Securitisation Framework is structured around five assessment criteria defined by the Better Regulation Guidelines (effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, EU added value and relevance). These criteria are individually analysed to assess to what extent the intervention was successful and why.\n\n4.1. Effectiveness\n\nThe effectiveness analysis considers how successful the Securitisation Framework has been in achieving the general objective laid out in the 2015 Impact Assessment, namely:\n\n\u201cto revive a safer securitisation market that will improve the financing of the EU economy, weakening the link between banks deleveraging needs and credit tightening in the short-run, and creating a more balanced and stable funding structure of the EU economy in the long-run.\u201d\n\nTo evaluate the general objective, we assess the framework's success in achieving the following specific and operational objectives outlined in the 2015 Impact Assessment:\n\n\u00b7\nRemove stigma from investors;\u00a0\n\n\u00b7\nRemove regulatory disadvantages for simple and transparent securitisation products. To enable the achievement of this objective, the intervention aimed to differentiate 'STS' products from more opaque and complex ones;\n\n\u00b7\nReduce/eliminate unduly high operational costs for issuers and investors. To enable the achievement of this objective, the intervention aimed to support the standardisation of processes and practices in securitisation markets and tackle regulatory inconsistencies.\n\nWhere the framework is considered to have been effective in achieving these specific and operational objectives, it is also considered as effective in contributing to the general objective. This section will quantitatively and qualitatively consider the effects of the intervention, the external factors affecting progress towards the objectives, and the unexpected or unintended effects driving or hampering progress.\n\n4.1.1. How effective was the Securitisation Framework in removing investor stigma towards securitisation\n\nIn the aftermath of the GFC, global securitisation markets suffered from investor stigma. In 2014, a survey from the BCBS-IOSCO (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision - International Organisation of Securities Commissions) showed that investor perception was the most critical factor driving securitisation market developments. The main concerns were the perceived complexity of securitisations and the potential for conflicts of interest and information asymmetry between issuers and investors.\n\nThe SECR aimed to reduce the investor stigma associated with securitisation by i) aligning the interests of issuers with those of investors via mandatory risk retention, ii) supporting market transparency (thus reducing information asymmetry), iii) banning complex re-securitisations, iv) differentiating STS securitisations from more complex ones, and v) introducing rules on credit granting standards for securitised exposures.\n\nInvestor stigma is a subjective concept based on the investor\u2019s perception. Therefore, the best way of measuring it is via stakeholder feedback. The feedback suggests that the Securitisation Regulation has been partly effective in reducing investor stigma. Views were largely split in the stakeholder feedback gathered during the latest targeted consultation (December 2024). 44 out of 131 respondents reported that the Framework has been effective at reducing investor stigma towards EU securitisations (13 \u201cFully agree\u201d, 31 \u201cAgree\u201d). 31 respondents disagreed (22: \u201cSomewhat disagree\u201d, 9: \u201cFully disagree). Notably, amongst the respondents identifying as investors, the ratio of negative responses is higher \u2013 19 out of 51 investors responded that the Framework has not been effective in reducing investor stigma. On the other hand, bilateral contact with investors has seen many speak positively about securitisation.\n\nRobust credit performance should help to address the investor stigma associated with securitisation. Figure 7 below explains the cumulative five-year average default rates for different asset classes and time periods during the period of past 20 to 40 years (e.g. in the case of European RMBS, it shows the 5-year cumulative default rate between 1988 and 2023). This number is comparable with other fixed income asset classes, like European corporate bonds or global sovereign bonds, reflecting the strong credit performance of RMBSs.\n\nFigure 7: 5-year average cumulative default rates \u2013 European ABS, European RMBS, European CLOs, and other fixed income asset classes\n\nSource: S&P Global Ratings Credit Research & Insights, S&P Global Market Intelligence\u2019s CreditPro, and Fitch Ratings\n\n4.1.2. How effective was the Securitisation Framework in differentiating simple, transparent and standardised securitisation products from more opaque and complex ones and in removing regulatory disadvantages for simple and transparent securitisation products?\n\n4.1.2.1. Differentiating simple, transparent and standardised securitisation products from more opaque and complex ones\n\nThe Securitisation Framework aimed to distinguish simple, transparent, and standardised securitisation products from more complex ones through the creation of the STS label. The label outlines specific criteria for simplicity, transparency and standardisation that securitisations must meet to be considered STS. There are distinct STS criteria that apply to longer-term traditional (true-sale) securitisation, to short-term ABCP securitisations, and to synthetic (on-balance-sheet) securitisations. Only when these criteria are fulfilled can securitisations be labelled as STS. This new label therefore makes it straightforward for investors to identify and distinguish STS securitisations from non-STS ones, which are typically less transparent and more complex as they have presumably failed to meet at least one of the STS criteria.\n\nMost stakeholders agree that the Framework has been effective in differentiating simple, transparent and standardised securitisations from more opaque and complex ones. 43 out of 131 respondents to the targeted consultation responded positively (16 out of 52 investors), while only 21 had a negative assessment. Figure 8 below presents the balance of opinions.\n\nFigure 8: Responses to the question whether the securitisation framework has been effective in differentiating simple, transparent and standardised securitisation products from more opaque and complex ones (total of 131 respondents)\n\nSource: European Commission\n\nLooking at market developments, there is a clear trend pointing to an increasing preference for STS issuance (see Table below). The share of STS issuance has been the highest in the synthetic segment in 2021 and 2022, while in 2023 it was higher in the traditional segment due to the one-off impact of a particularly large, retained transaction. This one-off transaction, however, is not indicative of a general market trend in the direction of higher share of STS issuance in the traditional securitisation segment.\n\nTable 4: Share of STS issuance in the EU, placed and retained\n\nSource: EBA, COREP statistics. Total issuance figures are in EUR bn. ABCP issuance is excluded as there are no available figures on origination amounts. These figures include securitisations originated by banks (i.e. bank is an originator or original lender), and non-bank originated securitisations where a bank plays a role as investor.\n\nThere are no available figures to confirm a significant price difference between STS and comparable non-STS products.\n\nIn view of these findings, we conclude that the securitisation framework has been effective in achieving the operational objective of differentiating STS products from more opaque and complex ones.\n\n4.1.2.2. Removing regulatory disadvantages for simple, transparent and standardised securitisations\n\na) Banking\n\nAs part of the Framework the CRR was amended to establish a more risk-sensitive prudential framework for STS securitisations. By introducing a dedicated capital treatment for STS securitisations, the Framework has been effective in removing undue regulatory disadvantages for STS securitisations, relative to non-STS ones. Figure 9 below compares the average risk weights for STS versus non-STS securitisations and illustrates that average STS risk weights are approximately half of non-STS securitisation risk weights. The STS framework therefore allows the banks to achieve more significant capital relief compared to non-STS securitisations, and results in a more risk-sensitive and hence more efficient capital allocation for banks.\n\nFigure 9: Average risk weights STS versus non-STS, by different approaches to the calculation of securitisation capital requirements for banks, Europe (G1), in Q4 2023\n\nSource: BCBS Dashboard (sample of 15 banks; IRBA means Securitisation Internal-Ratings Based Approach, ERBA means Securitisation External Ratings-Based Approach, IAA means Internal Assessment Approach, SA means Securitisation Standardised Approach).\n\nAs issuance and investment in STS transactions have become significantly more attractive compared to non-STS alternatives, one would expect absolute and relative volumes of STS transactions to have increased significantly over time and to have scaled up the market more in general. Based on data from EBA, since the entry into force of the framework in 2019, the share of STS transactions for banks has slowly and gradually increased and reached 25% and 53% of the overall outstanding volume for traditional securitisation and synthetic securitisation, respectively, at end 2023. Figure 10 illustrates that overall outstanding volume of STS transactions represent EUR 420 bn as of end 2023 (out of which EUR 155 bn are STS synthetic transactions, EUR 203 bn are STS traditional securitisation, and EUR 62 bn are STS ABCP securitisations).\n\nFigure 10: Overall outstanding volumes of securitisation transactions held by banks, by STS label (bn EUR)\n\nSource: EBA, COREP statistics (to note these figures include securitisations originated by banks (i.e. bank is a originator or original lender), and non-bank originated securitisations where a bank plays a role as investor).\n\nWhile the STS-label has had a more positive impact on the synthetic segment, the take up for the traditional securitisation segment and the overall STS market developments have been underwhelming to date. The reduction in the capital conservativeness for STS securitisations, in comparison to non-STS, does not seem to have provided a strong impetus for banks to engage more broadly in the STS market segment. The STS label and the Framework in general did not bring a significant amount of new bank originators or bank investors to the market, nor did it help expand the securitisation issuance to additional Member States. Also, it is likely that a part of the STS market are transactions that would have been issued anyway, even in the absence of the STS framework (as these have existed also before the introduction of the framework).\n\nSeveral bank respondents point to the overall complexity of the STS requirements to explain why STS issuance has remained below expectations. Others highlight the fact that the preferential capital treatment is made conditional on the compliance with additional criteria specified in the CRR that prescribe a minimum credit quality of the underlying exposures (arguing that de facto it is a \u2018STS+\u2019 label), which unduly limits the scope of transactions potentially eligible for the STS preferential treatment. All this may explain why most respondents to the targeted consultation seem to view the Framework as unsuccessful in removing regulatory disadvantages for STS products: 52 either fully or somewhat disagreed with the statement that the framework had removed regulatory disadvantage for STS. In contrast, only 13 somewhat agreed or fully agreed (12; 1, respectively).\n\nThese STS developments need to be interpreted within the broader securitisation market developments. The impact of the Securitisation Framework on reviving banks\u2019 interest in the securitisation market developments in general is ambiguous. Unduly high capital requirements, both for non-STS as well as STS securitisations, has been a key element of stakeholder feedback related to the bank prudential framework.\n\nThe ESAs 170 estimate that the revised prudential framework has led to an increase in banks\u2019 capital requirements for securitisation exposures of 114% for bank originators, 77% for bank sponsors and 105% for bank investors across the market, with large variations in the impact depending on the composition of the tranches held, compared to the previous regime. Senior tranches of securitisations have experienced an increase of more than 100% in capital requirements, while mezzanine tranches have experienced an even more significant increase of capital requirement with a median increase of 281%. Also, as shown in Figure 11 below, on average, the required capital for securitisations is approximately double the capital required for the capitalisation of the underlying pool of non-securitised assets.\n\nFigure 11: Capital non-neutrality, median for three regulatory approaches to calculation of capital in securitisation\n\nSource: EBA (IRBA means Securitisation Internal Ratings-Based approach, SA means Securitisation Standardised Approach, and ERBA means Securitisation External Ratings-Based Approach)\n\nAs securitisation adds a layer of risk in the form of complexity, agency risk and model uncertainty, the capital charges for a securitisation should be higher than for its underlying assets (i.e. neutrality is not justified and non-neutrality is one of defining elements of the securitisation capital framework). Nevertheless, the current degree of non-neutrality imposed by the existing rules does not appear fully proportionate to the increase in risk introduced by the securitisation process. Therefore, while the presence of non-neutrality is justified, it is the degree of it that does not seems so.\n\nConcretely, the level of capital non-neutrality seems disproportionately high relative to the remaining levels of agency and model risks in some types of securitisation transactions, given that these risks have been significantly reduced following the GFC, thanks to several supervisory and regulatory initiatives implemented in the EU. Model risks have been mitigated by several initiatives that have enhanced the banks\u2019 internal models (e.g. SSM completed its Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM), EBA completed its IRB repair programme, the CRR3 is phasing in the output floor requirement; all of which come on top of risk retention and the banning of re-securitisations in the Framework 171 ). Agency risk has been addressed by introducing risk retention requirements (which apply universally to all securitisations, unlike in the US where a majority of securitisations are fully excluded) and by creating the STS standard (where STS rules are significantly more prescriptive than equivalent Basel \u2018STC\u2019 standards).\n\nAlso, the EBA acknowledges the reduction in model and agency risk, associated with some specific types of securitisation transactions, since the introduction of the Securitisation Framework in the EU 172 . It should also be noted that the EU securitisation framework is applied more broadly than required under Basel standards. Unlike other jurisdictions, the EU applies the Basel standards to all its banks, large and small, both at consolidated and individual entity level, which introduces additional layers of prudence in the EU financial system, compared to other jurisdictions.\n\nCapital non-neutrality also seems disproportionately high in light of the robust credit performance of the EU securitisation market over the years 173 . The EU securitisation market\u2019s resilience has been tested through multiple economic cycles and periods of stress, including the GFC, the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDefault rates of EU securitisations have been significantly lower than those of US securitisations. Figure 12 below illustrates that US RMBS defaults in the period 2007-2022 dwarf those of EU RMBS in the same period.\n\nAlso, very few senior tranches of securitisations have ever suffered losses. Data over a 30-year time period show that default risk and ratings transition of European securitisations across tranches rated AAA to BB are commensurate with default and ratings transition data for other fixed income asset classes, such as European corporate bonds or global sovereign bonds, rated the same level, reflecting the strong credit performance of securitisations.\n\nFor example, based on data from S&P for the whole universe of European structured finance covering the period from 1983 to 2023, the yearly default rate for a mezzanine securitisation tranche with BBB rating is less than 0.5%, while the resulting risk weights under the securitisation capital framework are 220% 174 . A BBB-rated mezzanine tranche is historically comparably risky on average as an investment grade corporate bond, which receives a 60% risk weight or 100% risk weights under\u00a0the applicable framework. The ratio of overcapitalisation is therefore between x3.7 and x2.2, in this example. \u00a0\n\nFigure 12: Annual default rates of structured credit by sector contributions in per cent\n\nSource: BCBS dashboard ( https://www.bis.org/bcbs/dashboards.htm )\n\nIn addition, unjustified differences have been identified between the capital treatment of equivalent securitisation exposures calculated by different banks using different approaches to the calculation of capital. The level of non-neutrality under the standardised approaches (SEC-SA) is significantly higher than the level of non-neutrality under the internal approaches (SEC-IRBA), which disincentivises less sophisticated banks from engaging in securitisation.\n\nBesides undue levels of capital conservativeness, the evaluation of the Framework has uncovered a number of additional issues, which also could provide undue barriers for the banks\u2019 participation in the securitisation, whether as originators or investors.\u00a0One of those issues relates to the Significant Risk Transfer (SRT) framework. The design of the \u2018SRT tests\u2019, which specify how much risk needs to be transferred to third parties to benefit from capital relief, have a number of structural flaws. The SRT tests do not allow to appropriately capture all possible structures of securitisations and may fail to target the transfer the risk in some cases, which may impede on the robustness of the SRT framework 175 .\n\nThe existing SRT tests also do not provide sufficient guidance on how to assess some common structural features of securitisation transactions, which may affect the effectiveness of the risk transfer and may cast doubt on the ability of a given transaction to meet SRT conditions. In addition, the processes applied by the competent authorities to assess the SRT have in some instances been inconsistent, lengthy and cumbersome. These SRT Framework limitations, analysed in detail by EBA 176 , have contributed to uncertainty for the market and delays for some securitisation transactions and have led in some cases to unjustified inconsistencies in SRT outcomes and capital calculations in the SRT treatment of securitisations with comparable characteristics across Member States. Overall, this has constrained banks in their capacity to use securitisation as a capital optimisation tool and risk transfer tool.\n\nThis has also been confirmed in the public consultation, where a majority of respondents who actively responded do not consider the existing process of SRT supervisory assessments efficient and adequate. Despite the more recent increase in SRT securitisation transactions (i.e. transactions executed with a capital relief purpose) 177 and improvements in the SRT assessments and processes, some targeted changes to the existing SRT framework seem still warranted to increase the robustness and efficiency of the SRT framework. With respect to the SRT tests applied to securitisations, responses have been more nuanced; industry generally agrees with the conditions of the tests governing the transfer of risks and do not see a need to make them more robust, although they are not opposed to it. Public authorities on the other hand deem it necessary to increase the robustness of the framework, in line with the EBA report.\n\nAnother issue relates to the undue strictness of the eligibility rules for securitisation in the LCR. The LCR Delegated Act seeks to ensure that banks hold a sufficient and diversified liquidity buffer of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to meet net outflows under 30-day severe idiosyncratic and market wide stress conditions. Senior tranches of securitisations of various asset classes (including RMBS, auto loans and leases, consumer credit and SME loans) are eligible for the inclusion in the liquidity buffer, subject to certain conditions. Many stakeholders, however, point to the overly restrictive nature of the eligibility conditions, in particular as regards the rating requirements (only AAA-rated exposures are allowed) and haircuts (which extend from 25 to 35%). Stakeholders argue that the eligibility criteria are not commensurate with the market liquidity observed in the product, exhibited even under recent stressed liquidity conditions. This has also negatively impacted the bank investors\u2019 demand for the STS traditional securitisations, because the ability of the securitisation to be LCR-compliant is a primary criterion for banks\u2019 investment in the STS market segment. In turn, this has contributed to reduced demand by bank treasuries for senior tranches of publicly offered STS traditional securitisation and is having a negative impact on the market liquidity for those securitisations. Due to these regulatory restrictions, banks\u2019 share in the liquidity buffers is negligible and has never materially changed. Banks in the European Union invest less than 1% of their liquidity buffer in securitisations.\n\nIn sum, the evaluation of the Framework more generally has uncovered a number of undue barriers for banks to engage in securitisation, impacting STS securitisations, but also the securitisation market developments more broadly.\n\nPossible amendments to the Framework should focus on removing undue barriers for banks as issuers of securitisations. As one of the objectives should be to transfer risks outside of the banking sector, to other actors in the financial system best placed to bear them, banks should not be incentivised as investors in the risky tranches of the securitisations, i.e. first loss or mezzanine tranches which account for the majority of risks associated with securitisations. No prudential concerns have however been perceived with respect to banks\u2019 investments in the senior tranches, especially of STS securitisations, which contain minimal risk, and also in the context of wider efforts to enlarge the investor base for the senior tranches on a larger scale.\n\nb) Insurance\n\nHigh level description of Solvency II\n\nInsurance companies are subject to SII which regulates how much capital insurers should set aside to cater for the risks arising from their investment activities. While bigger insurers generally use their own modelling of risks (\u2018internal model\u2019) which is more tailored to the specificities of their risk profile, the smaller ones use the so-called \u2018standard formula\u2019 which clearly prescribes capital requirements on investments. As regards securitisation, while insurers using an internal model are relatively free to determine how to assess market and credit risks (subject to prior supervisory approval) \u2013 and they do invest more in securitisation than standard formula insurers16 \u2013, companies which use the standard formula have no discretion when it comes to computing capital requirements.\n\nThe initiative has been effective in removing regulatory disadvantages for simple and transparent securitisation products in terms of levels of capital requirements in comparison with more opaque ones. It has done this by lowering the level of capital requirements for STS transactions compared to before, and by keeping the capital requirements for non-STS transactions unchanged. Although not explicitly identified as an objective by the initial initiative, it can be inferred that the removal of prudential obstacles was expected to result in a framework that is more conducive to investments in high-quality securitisations. In fact, the initiative has contributed to increasing insurers\u2019 investments in securitisation in absolute amounts, though the share of this class in insurers\u2019 portfolios remains\u00a0modest 178 .\u00a0\n\nThis evolution confirms the feedback collected by the Commission through its consultation activities. For instance, a majority of respondents to the Commission targeted consultation expressed an interest in increasing their exposure to securitisation, at the same time acknowledging the importance of risk-return profiles and pointing to high compliance costs stemming from due diligence requirements.\n\nAssessment of effectiveness in terms of levels of capital requirements\n\nThe introduction of dedicated prudential treatment for STS securitisation has resulted in more differentiation between capital requirements for this type of securitisation compared with non-STS transactions. As such, this has been effective in removing undue disadvantage for simple and transparent securitisation when the standard formula is used. Capital requirements for simple securitisations are now up to 10 times lower than those applicable to non-STS securitisations (depending on the duration and seniority of the STS securitisation).\n\nCompared with previous rules, the Commission services have estimated that capital requirements for investments in simple and transparent securitisation are now 21.5% lower than prior to the initiative (circa 100 billion in capital relief).\n\nThe table below shows applicable capital requirements for different durations and ratings \u2013 reflective of relevant investment categories by insurance companies.\n\n\t\n\n2-year duration AAA-rated\n\n\t\n\n7-year duration AA-rated\n\n\t\n\n3-year duration BBB-rated\n\n\n\n\nSenior STS securitisation\n\n\t\n\n2%\n\n\t\n\n7,4%\n\n\t\n\n8,4%\n\n\n\n\nNon-senior STS securitisation\n\n\t\n\n5.6%\n\n\t\n\n20,8%\n\n\t\n\n23,7%\n\n\n\n\nNon-STS securitisation\n\n\t\n\n25%\n\n\t\n\n93,8%\n\n\t\n\n59,1%\n\nNote: How to read the table: when investing EUR 100 in a 2-year duration AAA-rated securitisation, the amount of capital to set aside for insurers is EUR 2 if the securitisation is \u201csenior STS\u201d, EUR 5.6 if the securitisation is non-senior STS, and EUR 25 if the securitisation is non-STS.\n\nAs expected, the reform had no effect on insurers which use an internal model. This is because even before the initiative, insurers using an internal model had the ability to make tailor-made modelling of the risk profile of their actual portfolio. The change to standard formula capital charges \u2013 which they do not use \u2013 has therefore no effect on their modelling capacities.\n\nAs part of the targeted consultation, some stakeholders \u2013 the majority of which are non-insurers \u2013 claim that like for the standard formula, capital requirements based on internal models can disincentivise investments in securitisations. However, the detailed answers supporting such criticisms suggest other factors being pertinent, such as risk modelling maintenance (e.g., high costs of keeping the model fit for purpose and up-to-date), data miscalibrations (e.g., some stakeholders complain about the use of historical post financial crisis data dominated by spread volatility, rating migration, etc.) which are not securitisation-specific, but concern any asset class. In addition, supervisory authorities may also have negative perceptions about securitisation (stigma) and could exercise stricter scrutiny when approving internal models on securitisation, although there is no available concrete evidence of such possible risk. On the other hand, some other insurance stakeholders point out that internal models capture the risk reduction benefits associated with securitisation more effectively than the standard formula for capital requirements. In any case, no stakeholder identified a clear area of \u2018change\u2019 to the internal model framework applicable to securitisation.\n\nAssessment of effectiveness in terms of increasing levels of investments in simple and transparent securitisations\n\nThe effectiveness of prudential changes, stemming from the 2019 reform, on the level of investments in simple and transparent securitisations is more ambiguous. Investments in STS securitisations remain the minority of insurers\u2019 securitisation investments despite the much lower capital requirements. In absolute amounts, securitisation investments have increased by EUR between 5 and 6 billion between end-of-2018 and end-of-2023, 2018 being the last year under \u2018old\u2019 rules prior to the introduction of the current Framework 179 . In relative terms, this represents a significant increase of between 50% and 66%, albeit from a very small base 180 .\n\nCapital requirements on senior STS securitisation are very close to those applicable to bonds. Still, the share of STS securitisation in investment portfolios is negligible, whereas corporate bonds make up 18% of total investments. In fact, there is no evidence that STS securitisation\u00a0offers a return that is significantly higher than that applicable to other fixed income asset classes of similar credit quality. For instance, according to some data shared by industry stakeholders with DG FISMA, in January 2025 there was a 10-basis point differential between the spreads on AAA-rated (senior) STS mortgage-backed securitisation and corporate bonds with the same ratings 181 .\n\nOne of the reasons for the low yield on senior STS securitisation, in particular STS RMBS, may be the fact that the pool of loans to be securitised was originated during times where interest rates on such loans were exceptionally low (in some Member States even 1% or lower), which means that the most senior tranches of a securitisation of such loans would have very low yields. In addition, capital requirements, though quite low, remain slightly higher than those applicable to such similar asset classes. Investments in securitisations requires, in addition, implementing extensive due diligence requirements \u2013 more extensive than for other asset classes (see next section). This means that the return on risk adjusted capital (i.e. put in simpler terms, financial return divided by applicable capital and compliance requirements) remains lower for STS securitisation.\n\nAccording to the responses to the targeted consultation, for a majority of stakeholders capital requirements are disproportionate and not commensurate with the risk of STS securitisations. It is however disputable that prudential rules on STS securitisation are a major obstacle to investments.\n\nAs regards senior STS securitisations, capital requirements only exceed those of corporate bonds by less than 2 percentage points, depending on the rating and duration. Despite the small difference in capital requirements, insurers allocate a much bigger portion of their investment portfolio to corporate bonds in comparison to securitisation products (circa 28% vs less than 1% of total investments in 2023 182 ). This indicates that other factors, besides capital requirements, influence insurers\u2019 preference for corporate bonds.\n\nAs regards non-senior STS securitisations, the average ratio of capital charges for non-senior to senior STS securitisation is broadly in line with banking rules under the 2019 framework 183 .\u00a0The lack of supply of non-senior STS tranches may be driving the low level of\u00a0insurers\u2019 investments. Based on data by AFME, the outstanding balance of securitisation tranches rated A or lower (used as a proxy for non-senior tranches) represented 13.3% of the total outstanding balance of rated securitisations in Europe at the end of 2023. By comparison, in the US where insurers are much more active investors in the securitisation market, this ratio stood at 45.2%. Another obstacle to insurers\u2019 investment in this segment could be high market competition, as originating banks also confirm that non-senior STS tranches are largely over-subscribed (i.e. the demand exceeds by a large multiple the supply).\n\nThere are other reasons which may also explain why insurers are not more engaged in the securitisation market. The 2022 EIOPA\u00a0advice on securitisation 184 indicates that securitisation does not match insurers\u2019 investment preferences which are focused on the \u2018financial risk / return profile\u2019 (and not the \u2018prudential cost / return profile\u2019) of the investment and asset-liability management, in particular for insurance products with long-term life liability and fixed cash flows (which is the case not only for life insurers, but also for many non-life insurers offering liability insurance) which insurers seek to cover with long-term fixed rate investments in order to reduce the risk that changes in the level of interest rates or in the rhythm of cash inflows, lead to a deterioration of their capital position. The importance of an effective asset liability management became evident during the past years when interest rates varied a lot. However, this assessment needs to be nuanced. EU insurers were more active in the securitisation market prior to the GFC which suggests that they did identify an interest in this asset class. In addition, US insurers are significantly investing in securitisation. This contradicts the statement that securitisation is not appropriate to match long-term liabilities as US life insurers largely underwrite annuity products with very long duration and regular cash outflows.\n\nAnother reason for the lack of demand for securitisation from the insurance industry is that investors perceive securitisation as a complex product with extensive and costly due diligence requirements (see assessment in section 4.1.3. below).\n\n4.1.3. How effective has the Securitisation Framework been in reducing/eliminating unduly high operational costs for issuers and investors?\n\nThe 2015 Impact Assessment highlighted the absence of standardisation in data provision across different types of securitisations as a determining factor behind the costly due diligence and credit risk analysis by investors. Moreover, differences in disclosure and due diligence requirements applicable to securitisations between the various sectoral legislation at the time also resulted in unduly high costs for issuers and investors.\n\nWhile the framework sought to reduce operational costs that stemmed from regulatory inconsistencies and a lack of standardisation, stakeholder feedback from the 2021 targeted consultation 185 reveals that high operational costs for issuers and investors remain a significant issue. 31 of 55 respondents (~56.4%) considered the due diligence and transparency regime provided for in the SECR to impose unduly high operational costs for issuers and investors.\n\nStakeholders considered compliance with these requirements to be overly costly, in requiring specialized processes that are more time-consuming and complex than those used for other financial instruments, such as covered bonds. Respondents also cited the need to involve external consultants, providing IT solutions and legal advice, as a significant cost of operations, and a barrier to entry for new issuers and small investors.\n\nRecent stakeholder feedback gathered during the latest targeted consultation (conducted from October \u2013 December 2024) confirms the 2021 feedback. 79 out of 131 respondents report that the framework has not been effective in reducing unduly high operational costs and only five respondents (two government authorities and three associations) responded positively.\n\n4.1.3.1. Due diligence requirements\n\nBased on the feedback provided by stakeholders, Article 5 (due diligence requirements) has resulted in an estimated additional one-off costs of EUR 13-26 million, and approx. EUR 520 million annual recurring costs for all investors in the market. For due diligence, most of the costs for investors are recurring as for each investment transaction a comprehensive due diligence check needs to be performed that takes for most investors several days.\n\nNext to this stakeholder feedback, a comparison of the due diligence requirements applicable to major institutional investors (see Annex XII), confirms that that the regulatory due diligence burden is much higher for securitisation than for other instruments. While for other financial products, investors must only comply with the general principles-based due diligence rules included in their respective sectoral legislations, the requirements are more detailed for securitisations.\n\nSome of these additional regulatory due diligence requirements may be justified due to the specific nature and risk characteristics of securitisation transactions (e.g. requiring investors to look at the structural characteristics of a securitisation) but other requirements cannot be justified on these grounds. For example, in addition to carrying out a thorough assessment of the risks prior to holding a securitisation position, EU investors are required to carry out a list of extensive verification activities to check that originators have complied with Article 6 (risk retention), Article 7 (disclosure), Article 9 (credit granting criteria), and Articles 19 to 22 and 23 to 26 (STS criteria). These verification activities (requiring investors to check issuer compliance with certain criteria) are unique to securitisations and are largely duplicative since EU supervisors are also required to check that EU originators comply with these requirements. They significantly increase due diligence costs for institutional investors (several respondents, including associations representing larger groups of investors, estimate potential cost savings of removing the above-mentioned verification activities to 20%-50%).\n\nMoreover, stakeholders argue that the risk assessment that is required to be carried out under Article 5(3) is not proportionate because it does not differentiate between different types of securitisation positions. For example, a senior investor investing in a triple A tranche has the same requirements as a junior investor investing in a first-loss piece, even though the risk of the position is much lower for the senior investor than the junior investor. While this may not be an issue for large investors that invest in a large number of securitisation positions and can therefore benefit from economies of scale, it can be a barrier to entry for small investors that would only be interested in investing in less risky positions. The high one-off due diligence effort placing effectively a barrier to entry for smaller players has been pointed out as a major obstacle and opportunity cost by 10 respondents including 3 business associations representing larger investor groups.\n\nIndustry respondents to the targeted consultation state that the magnitude of the due diligence duties act as a barrier to entry. This has been mentioned in more than 40 replies. The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), representing an estimated share of about 50% of the public traditional market, estimated that it takes about 9 months to set-up a new business for EU securitisation investment, of which two months would be necessary to understand and put in place a framework that implements the due diligence rules. According to the example in \u201cAnnex III: Who is affected and how?\u201d, it may require up to 40 months and a minimum investment pool of at least EUR 1.5 billion for a low-risk STS asset management business to break even. This makes market entry unattractive for investors focusing on high-rated and low-yield securitisation products. AFME estimates the universe of asset managers that are regularly active in the public securitisation market to below 20 players. In one comparable covered bond transaction alone, the number of investors is significantly higher than 20.\n\n4.1.3.2. Transparency requirements\n\nBased on the feedback provided by stakeholders, the transparency requirements imposed on the issuers/originators, one-off costs are estimated at EUR 370 million and make up the biggest share of the additional costs posed by Article 7. This is due to the IT investments necessary to put a reporting system up and running, whereas afterwards the ongoing costs are usually moderate, in this case we estimate approx. EUR 120 million annual recurring costs for all EU issuers in the markets.\n\nWhile there was significant information disclosure in securitisation transactions prior to the Securitisation Framework, there were no direct, and sanctionable, disclosure requirements that applied to all types of securitisation issuers (banks and non-banks). In general, the amount and type of information disclosed was determined by the needs of the market. Large banks that sought access to the ECB\u2019s liquidity framework had a more developed disclosure infrastructure to comply with the ECB\u2019s collateral requirements.\n\nImplementing the transparency framework involved significant implementation costs for all types of issuers. These costs consisted of: i) gathering information at the level of each individual loan prior to issuance, ii) updating this information at least quarterly (monthly in the case of short-term securitisations), iii) disclosing all information necessary for investors and supervisors to understand the features of the transaction, iv) in the case of STS securitisations, disclosing information on compliance with the STS criteria, and v) preparing regular investor reports. Reporting entities had to develop the necessary IT infrastructure to report this information to the securitisation repositories in the required format. Moreover, securitisation repositories had to develop the infrastructure to receive and provide access to this information to investors, potential investors and competent authorities.\n\nCosts are driven by the wide scope of the transparency requirement. Both public and private transactions are captured and must provide the same information to their investors. However, stakeholders have reported that investors in a public securitisation do not have the same information needs as investors in a private securitisation. The latter have a stronger negotiation position vis-\u00e0-vis the issuer of the transaction, compared to a public securitisation which is offered to a multitude of investors on terms determined by the issuer. This means that a private securitisation tends to be structured according to the particular requirements and information needs of the investor. Moreover, private transactions are often tailored to fit the needs for investors. They have particular characteristics and tailored underlying pools of assets, and therefore detailed standardised disclosure templates do not adequately capture the essence of the transaction in a fully satisfactory way for the investor. As a result, issuers of a private transaction will have to disclose information that satisfies the investor\u2019s needs which may not be satisfied by the Article 7 disclosures, increasing disclosure burden without an accompanying increase in transparency.\n\nFurthermore, the extent of the information that is required is overly wide. The SECR introduced comprehensive disclosure requirements for all in-scope securitisation instruments (i.e. securitisations that are issued by an EU-based original lender, originator or sponsor, and/or securitisations that EU institutional investors invest in). This aimed to increase market transparency and provide investors with sufficient information to carry out due diligence. These disclosure requirements were further specified in the October 2019 Regulatory Technical Standards , which included detailed loan-level disclosure templates for all securitisations falling under the scope of the SECR (the \u2018ESMA templates\u2019). The ESMA templates built upon the ECB\u2019s existing loan-level templates, but significantly increased the number of mandatory fields across all asset categories, thus increasing the reporting burden for issuers. Stakeholder feedback has indicated that not all the information that is reported in the ESMA templates is useful for investors. There is room to significantly reduce the number of required data fields, thus reducing the reporting burden, without impacting the usefulness of the information to investors.\n\nThe above is also confirmed by stakeholder feedback. Stakeholders that participated in the consultation report that securitisation disclosure costs are significantly higher than those for other instruments with similar characteristics (29 out 131 replied \u2019significantly higher\u2019, 5 \u2018moderately higher\u2019, 95 didn\u2019t reply or said they don\u2019t know). Respondents pointed out in particular the difference in disclosure requirements between securitisation and covered bonds. Industry stakeholders characterised covered bonds disclosure as \u201csubject to much high-level and less prescriptive transparency provisions and require aggregated data reporting (rather than loan-by-loan)\u201d and driven by industry consensus via the ECBC Covered Bond Label. Annex X provides a detailed comparison of the disclosure requirements for securitisations and covered bonds.\n\nFigure 13: Responses to the question how do the disclosure costs (for securitisations) compare with the disclosure costs for other instruments with similar risk characteristics? \n\nFurthermore, the transaction information provided under the SECR is not suited to its primary audience \u2013 investors. Usage statistics 186 for public securitisations show that only a limited number of large public investors are using the data reported under the ESMA templates. In fact,\u00a0many investors have reported that they rely on alternative disclosure channels to obtain the information they need for their due diligence.\n\nFigure 14: Distribution of the number of downloads of the securitisation data templates prescribed by the Commission Delegated Regulation 2020/1224 by category of data users (August 2023 \u2013 July 2024)\n\nSource: JCSC Article 44 report (reference to be updated once the report is public)\n\nIn view of these findings, we conclude that the securitisation framework has not been effective in reducing/eliminating unduly high operational costs for issuers and investors.\n\n4.1.4. How effective has the Securitisation Framework been in supporting standardisation and in tackling regulatory inconsistencies?\n\nAccording to stakeholder feedback gathered during the targeted consultation, a large majority (i.e. 54 out of 82 respondents with opinion with 131 total respondents) considers the current framework as effective in supporting standardisation processes and practices. In particular, stakeholders find that the framework has been effective in increasing the degree of standardisation of marketing and reporting material, but a significant majority disagrees that the framework has reduced operational costs linked to standardised securitisation products. The latter is consistent with the negative assessment of the effectiveness of the framework in reducing unduly high operational costs for issuers and investors overall.\n\nThe Securitisation Framework has played a crucial role in promoting standardisation in securitisation markets by introducing a list of common definitions and establishing common rules for transparency, disclosure, due diligence, and risk retention. These rules apply uniformly to all securitisations and all parties involved, helping to eliminate regulatory inconsistencies and support standardisation in processes and practices in the EU securitisation market. While the Securitisation Framework has brought greater uniformity to the market, the high operational costs it entails for issuers and investors has offset some of the benefits that standardised processes were intended to bring to the EU securitisation market.\n\nAs regards regulatory inconsistencies \u2013 before the SECR came into place there was no common definition of a securitisation across the EU, nor were there common due diligence, transparency, or risk retention rules. Instead, rules were fragmentated across different sector specific legislation and across different Member States. As a result, in 2015, the Joint Committee of the ESAs recommended to harmonise regulatory requirements for securitisations.\n\nWith respect to tackling the regulatory inconsistencies, despite the consolidation of the applicable requirements to all market participants in a single legislative instrument, stakeholders generally disagree that the framework has been effective in tackling regulatory inconsistencies. Only 21 out of 131 total respondents indicated some level of agreement (9 out of 52 investors and 3 out of 32 originators). Indeed, some elements that are important for the securitisation market, such as insolvency legislation, were left outside the scope of the securitisation framework. Lack of standardisation in these areas has been recently pointed out by stakeholders and researchers as one of the factors determining the muted development of the securitisation market in the EU. At the same time, these issues are not specific to securitisation but are of broader significant for capital markets development in the EU. Therefore, any measures to address them should be part of a broader strategy.\n\nIn view of these findings, we conclude that the securitisation framework has been effective in achieving the operational objective of supporting standardisation of marketing and reporting material, but it has not been fully effective in tackling regulatory inconsistencies in the securitisation market.\n\n4.2. Efficiency\n\nThe efficiency analysis assesses the benefits and costs arising from the EU intervention and whether it was cost effective. The analysis draws upon stakeholder feedback on costs associated with the Framework, from the 2024 targeted consultation. While the implementation of the Framework is considered somewhat cost-effective for the prudential aspects, its non-prudential elements have resulted in high costs for issuers and investors.\n\n4.2.1. Benefits\n\nThe main benefit associated with the introduction of the SECR is the overall increase in market transparency, as well as investor protection. This benefit contributes to the attainment of the objective of \u201cremoving investor stigma\u201d. By introducing clear transparency requirements, investors and supervisors are better able to assess the risks of securitisations. Similarly, a robust due diligence process ensures that investors know what they are buying and increases trust in the securitisation market. The main benefit of the introduction of the STS framework is that it has fostered simplicity, transparency and standardisation of the securitisation structures in the EU. Such structures are easier for investors and supervisors to assess.\n\nThe framework has differentiated the capital requirements for banks\u2019 STS securitisations compared to non-STS ones, in an efficient way. Capital requirements for STS securitisations can be as low as half of the capital requirements for non-STS securitisations, even if STS capital requirements are still generally higher than what they would have been for equivalent securitisations before the framework came into place. Banks face lower capital requirements for their exposures to STS securitisations in two ways: (i) a reduced (p) factor (the (p) factor for STS transactions is half the level of the one for non-STS transactions, and can therefore result in half of the capital requirements for the respective tranches, compared to a non-STS securitisation); (ii) a lower floor for minimum capital requirements (10% risk-weight floor for capital requirements for their exposure to senior tranches in STS securitisations, compared to 15% for senior tranches in non-STS securitisation).\n\nFor insurers, the changes implemented in SII have reduced the capital cost of investing in STS securitisation, in particular for senior tranches. As a result, the Framework incentivises insurers to invest in the simpler and more transparent part of the securitisation market. STS securitisations are typically more liquid and easier to trade compared to non-STS securities. This liquidity can help insurers manage their investment portfolios more flexibly, especially in volatile market conditions, by enabling easier buying or selling of assets. DG FISMA calculations suggests that STS capital requirements are on average 80% lower than non-STS securitisations on average. Investments in senior STS tranches, where demand is still perceived as low by originating banks, have increased by one third between 2019 and 2023 up to EUR 1.25 trillion.\n\n4.2.2. Costs\n\nThe main costs associated with the provisions of the SECR are the due diligence and transparency costs explained in the Effectiveness section above. Investors\u2019 due diligence costs under Art. 5 SECR are primarily recurrent, as each investment transaction requires a comprehensive, standalone due diligence check. On the other hand, one-off costs comprise the biggest share of the additional transparency costs imposed by Art. 7. DG FISMA estimates these costs at around EUR 370 million of such one-off costs. One-off costs are generally attributable to the initial financial outlay associated with establishing a compliant reporting IT system. The subsequent annually recurring costs are usually moderate: approximately EUR 120 million for all EU issuers in the market.\n\nThe transparency regime has also introduced additional costs to the securitisation industry through the set-up of securitisation repositories. Issuers of public securitisations are obliged to report a rich set of information to a securitisation repository to make this data available to investors and supervisors. While investors and supervisors can use the repositories free of charge, issuers reporting to the repository are required to pay a fee. To illustrate: EDW, one of the main securitisation repositories in the EU, charges EUR 7,000-7,500 per year for non-ABCPs, and EUR 9,000 per year for master trusts and ABCP programs. Originators also incur a\u00a0one-off deal initiation fee of EUR 8,000, to access some premium services 187 .\u00a0\n\nIn addition, the transparency regime may also keep issuers from being able to securitise certain pools of loans in case they are not able to collect all the necessary information or are if there are concerns about the confidentiality of the data that is reported via securitisation repositories. Therefore, the issuer may have to incur additional costs in order to be able to build up a pool of securitise-able assets or simply be forced to forego the opportunity to securitise.\n\nMoreover, issuing and investing in STS securitisations comes with additional verification costs. According to Article 5 of the SECR, investors are required to verify that STS transactions comply with STS criteria. Furthermore, issuers are subject to sanctions if they mislead investors by mis-labelling a transaction as STS compliant. As a safeguard, therefore, most issuers\u00a0avail of a Third-Party Verifier (TPV) for STS transactions. The costs of such a service range from EUR 33,500 - 44,000 for a traditional STS securitisation with a maturity of up to three years, and EUR 38,500 - 46,750 for a three-year on-balance-sheet STS transaction 188 .\u00a0\n\nThe costs associated with the introduction of the amended banking prudential framework are assessed to be low (though not quantified). They mostly comprise of one-off adaptation costs to the new securitisation prudential framework and some undue increases in capital costs for STS securitisations, considering the significant non-neutrality introduced in the capital framework which may be deemed excessive in light of the good credit performance of STS securitisations and numerous risk mitigants risks applied to STS structures.\n\nThe implementation costs associated with changes in insurance prudential rules are reported to be very low (though not quantified) \u2013 they mainly consist of replacing the risk factors for so-called \u2018type 1\u2019 securitisation with those applicable for STS securitisations. The lower capital requirements on simple and transparent securitisation can result in some additional risk taking by insurers depending on how they use the capital relief. However, in view of the ongoing level of STS securitisations in insurers\u2019 investment portfolios, that risk seems largely contained at EEA level, without precluding that it could be more significant for individual insurers with specific exposures to securitisations.\n\n4.3. Coherence\n\nThis section assesses coherence of the Securitisation Framework, both in terms of the degree of coherence between the provisions within the Framework (internal coherence) as well as its relationship with other pieces of legislation (external coherence).\n\n4.3.1. Internal coherence\n\nOverall, the Securitisation Framework shows a high degree of internal coherence. It simultaneously creates a general regulatory system for European securitisations, while providing for harmonised prudential treatment through targeted amendments to the CRR, LCR Delegated Act and SII.\n\nThe different provisions in the SECR follow a clear logical structure, starting with generally applicable horizontal rules (due diligence, transparency, risk retention etc). Additional requirements are specified for securitisations benefitting from the STS label. These more rigorous criteria are consistent with the logic of differentiating the STS category and its associated prudential benefit. Stakeholders have confirmed that this structure does not give rise to incoherence, duplication or conflicting requirements.\n\nPrior to the introduction of the Framework, inconsistencies were identified between the framework for banks (CRR) and for insurers (SII). Therefore, the Framework introduced dedicated preferential prudential treatments for both senior and non-senior STS securitisation under both banking and insurance rules.\n\nIn relation to insurance, there are still two sources of incoherence:\n\n\u00b7\nIncoherence with banking rules: SII does not differentiate between senior and non-senior tranches of non-STS securitisations, unlike in the banking rules. This results in an inconsistency of the risk sensitivity of the prudential treatment for banks and insurers.\n\n\u00b7\nInternal incoherence on SII: This can be illustrated by looking at disadvantageous prudential treatment of securitisation, when compared to\u00a0equity shares. Holders of shares are generally the first to absorb losses in case of insolvency (i.e. before debtholders and other creditors) and they are exposed to significant volatility. Compared to this, the highest-rated senior tranches of securitisation are more protected in case of insolvency and arguably less volatile than equity. However, while capital charges on unlisted equities or on equities from emerging markets are on average at 49%, even the most senior tranches of non-STS securitisation can be subject to capital charges significantly exceeding 50%.\n\n4.3.2. External Coherence\n\nThe SECR presents a logical and coherent framework, uniting different legal provisions scattered in various pieces of legislation. By doing so it avoids external inconsistencies and differential regulatory treatment. Feedback from stakeholders confirm that the approach taken is the appropriate one.\n\nSome minor inconsistencies have been found between the SECR and the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) as regards due diligence and delegation requirements. In certain instances, this has led to duplicative compliance requirements. The EU Securitisation Framework is coherent with the securitisation framework for regulatory capital requirements issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) , IOSCO's recommendations on securitisation , as well as the BCBS-IOSCO criteria for identifying simple, transparent and comparable securitisations (called Simple, Transparent and Standardised in the EU). The EU Securitisation Framework has adapted the Basel and IOSCO standards on a few aspects, such as the scope of application of the STS label (extended to synthetic securitisations), the hierarchy of the approaches and the eligibility of securitisations in the LCR.\n\n4.4. EU added value\n\nThis section considers if and how the EU intervention made a difference. Securitisation Framework has provided a clear EU-wide legal framework by harmonising existing provisions which were scattered across a large number of sectoral legal acts that applied to different market entities.\n\nThe SECR has introduced a single, coherent and harmonised legal framework for original lenders, originators, sponsors, securitisation special purpose vehicles (SSPVs) and institutional investors participating in the EU securitisation market. A Directive or national-level legislation would not have led to the same results. Transposition of a Directive or national laws would have led to divergence across Member States, resulting in distortion of competition and regulatory arbitrage. Moreover, most existing EU provisions in this area had been successfully adopted and implemented in the form of Regulations.\n\nSecuritisation products are part of EU financial markets that are open and integrated. Securitisation allows to link financial institutions from different Member States and non-Member States: banks can originate the loans that are securitised, while financial institutions such as insurers and investment funds invest in these products and they can do so across European borders, but also globally. The securitisation market is therefore international in nature and measures at the EU level are the right tool for designing an adequate legal framework. The fact that originators and investors follow the uniform rules across the Single Market reduces the cost of issuance and investing.\n\nThe Regulation has facilitated further integration of the market, and the legal framework has been most effective with regard to the policy aim of providing a high level of investor protection through risk retention and information availability. The STS label has been widely accepted as a market standard. It serves to help investors identify high-quality structures and removes the stigma attached to securitisation.\n\n4.5. Is the intervention still relevant?\n\nOver the implementation period of the Securitisation Framework, its initial objectives have remained relevant to ongoing EU policy goals and priorities. Europe\u2019s investment needs have grown in size, scope, and urgency since the introduction of the Securitisation Framework, and they cannot be met by public financing alone. As such, the alleviation of undue obstacles to private financing remains a highly \u2013 and ever more - relevant objective to attain.\n\nThe Savings and Investment Union was unveiled in 2024 as a cornerstone of the 2024-2029 Commission mandate, and securitisation has a key role to play in this regard. Securitisation allows lenders to package and sell the loans that they grant to capital market investors and, through this process, they free up capacity that could be used for more lending, for instance to SMEs and corporates.\n\nLooking ahead, the needs and objectives of this initiative will be of sustained and increasing relevance in the push for European competitiveness. The Competitiveness Compass 189 highlights the need for the EU to meet its massive financing needs, to deliver on objectives in the areas of innovation, the clean, digital and tech transitions. The Savings and Investment Union is a priority to meet these financing needs and ensure European competitiveness in the years to come.\n\nFrom a non-prudential perspective, feedback from the targeted consultation indicates that while the current Framework and its subsequent amendments have gone some way to achieve the stated objectives, issuance and investment barriers remain high. Stakeholder feedback does indicate that there is sizeable investor interest in EU securitisation products, but the persistence of the barriers identified prior to the introduction of the current Framework, continue to impede this demand.\n\nIn terms of prudential rules for banks, the initiative was focused on introducing a differentiated regulatory framework for simple, transparent and standardised securitisations. While a degree of risk sensitivity has been introduced in the Framework by allowing lower capital for STS securitisations compared to non-STS securitisations, it continues to incorporate a significant degree of conservatism, both for STS and non-STS transactions, which results in high bank capital requirements for their securitisation exposures. The existing prudential requirements are not sufficiently risk sensitive and do not adequately reflect the numerous EU regulatory and supervisory risk mitigants that have been put in place in recent years as well as the good credit performance of securitisations observed in the recent past. Therefore, they discourage EU banks from participating more actively in the EU securitisation market. A more active role by banks in the EU securitisation market is essential to achieve the general objective of the initiative.\n\nWith regard to insurance prudential rules, while capital requirements on STS securitisations have been significantly reduced, the framework for non-STS securitisation is characterised by a high level of conservatism. In fact, capital requirements on non-standard securitisation are still based on EIOPA\u2019s 2013 calibrations 190 , i.e. in the aftermath of the Subprime and Great Financial Crises, and before Solvency II started to apply. Such a level of conservatism may no longer be justified in view of the much more robust legal framework and requirements applicable to securitisation investments. Prudential rules on non-STS securitisations remain largely more capital intensive than those applicable to STS securitisations, irrespective of the credit quality of the securitisation. In general, investments in non-STS securitisation require locking an amount of capital that is more than half the value of the investments. Many stakeholders provide this feedback in the context of the targeted consultation.\n\nIn addition, prudential rules for insurers do not differentiate between senior and non-senior tranches of non-STS securitisation, and as a result the existing framework can incentivise insurers to invest in the riskier junior non-STS category so as to obtain a higher return with the same capital charge as the one applicable to senior non-STS category. The framework is therefore biased towards most risky non-STS securitisations (compared with less risky ones) which might be detrimental to policyholder protection because unduly encouraging (or even \u2018prudentially rewarding\u2019) insurers to take more risk. Strong investor demand for senior tranches would incentivise more securitisation issuance, as argued in section 2.3, and therefore contribute to achieving the general objective.\n\n5.\nWhat are the conclusions and lessons learned?\n\nThe Securitisation Framework has partly met its original objectives. The intervention has not fully achieved the general objective of reviving the securitisation market, although it has been successful in ensuring safe and high-quality securitisation practices on the part of issuers and investors.\n\nRegarding the specific objectives, the Framework has been successful in supporting the standardisation of processes and practices in securitisation markets and partly tackled regulatory inconsistencies. However, it has only been partly successful in removing the stigma associated with securitisation, and in removing regulatory disadvantages for simple and transparent securitisations, despite the regulatory improvements put in place. Moreover, the Framework has not been successful in reducing high operational costs and in significantly scaling up the securitisation market in the EU. While the implementation of the Framework is considered somewhat cost-effective for the prudential aspects, its non-prudential elements have resulted in high costs for issuers and investors.\n\nIn the areas of transparency and due diligence requirements, the evaluation shows that very prescriptive legal requirements result in high operational costs for issuers and investors without necessarily advancing the policy objectives. A \u201ccatch-all\u201d approach may be unsuited to the different needs of public and private investors, and a more principles-based approach would allow the achievement of the objectives in a more cost-efficient manner.\n\nInvestor stigma towards securitisation continues to be observed in the EU market, despite the robust credit performance and legal framework. However, all the necessary safeguards are in place to mitigate investor stigma, and a further improvement in investors\u2019 perception of securitisation in the EU is expected in the medium to long term.\n\nThe regulatory disadvantage for STS securitisations has been addressed but the existing bank prudential and liquidity rules still unduly disincentivise banks\u2019 participation in the securitisation market, both as originators and senior tranche investors for both STS and non-STS securitisations. Despite the strong historic performance of EU-originated securitisations and despite the safeguards that have been introduced in recent years, the prudential framework for banks is still insufficiently risk sensitive and capital \u2018non-neutrality\u2019 is disproportionately high for certain securitisation transactions. In addition, the rules governing significant risk transfer incorporate a number of structural flaws and can lead to complex and inconsistent supervisory processes and outcomes. Lastly, the strictness of the eligibility rules for securitisation in the LCR has reduced bank treasury demand for senior tranches of publicly offered securitisations, with a knock-on negative impact on the market liquidity for those securitisations.\n\nTo address undue prudential barriers for banks originating and investing in securitisations, a revision of the prudential treatment of securitisations is necessary. Any future amendments of the prudential treatment of securitisation transactions need to be effective, proportionate and well-targeted and strike a balance between safeguarding financial stability on the one hand and on the other hand supporting market development and reducing undue disincentives to banks\u2019 involvement in the securitisation markets.\n\nThe insurance prudential rules introduced under the evaluated Framework have failed to stimulate increased investment in STS securitisations, which continue to represent a minority of insurers' securitisation investments, despite their much lower capital requirements compared to non-STS ones. Greater investment by insurers in non-senior STS securitisations is not helped by low supply in current market conditions, where non-senior STS securitisations account for less than 20% of total outstanding placements.\n\nThe evaluation of the Securitisation Framework for insurers has highlighted several important lessons. First, the current framework can incentivise insurers to invest in riskier junior non-STS securitisations, which may undermine policyholder protection. To address this, a revision of the prudential treatment of non-STS securitisations is necessary. Second, the lack of differentiation between senior and non-senior tranches of non-STS securitisations in the SII framework creates an inconsistency with banking regulations, which should be corrected for better alignment. Third, the overly conservative calibration of non-STS securitisations under SII, especially when compared to equity investments, indicates the need for a more balanced approach to risk assessment. Lastly, enhancing the risk sensitivity of non-STS securitisations emerges as the most effective solution to encourage securitisation while ensuring financial stability. This approach, coupled with modest adjustments to STS securitisation capital requirements, would foster insurers' investments in simpler securitisations and further support the EU's STS standard. To conclude, burden reduction and prudential costs should be reconsidered across the board, not just for STS securitisations, to create a more effective and equitable framework for insurers.\n\nThe evaluation concludes that the intervention is still relevant, but more is needed to ensure that securitisation can meaningfully contribute to improve the financing of the EU economy and further develop the Savings and Investment Union. Therefore, additional measures are needed to fulfil reach the general and specific objectives of the original intervention.\u00a0\n\n\nAnnex VI: Securitisation Platform(s)\n\nCentralising securitisation issuance via a securitisation platform or platforms could offer another way to lower costs for the industry and make it easier and more attractive to participate in the securitisation market. The impact of a securitisation platform would vary depending on its scope, design and specific features, such as whether it includes public guarantees. Various reports presented different ideas 191 .\n\nFrom an issuer\u2019s perspective, a common platform could centralise securitisation issuance of a securitisation and thus reduce the costs per transaction (structuring and legal costs, etc.). This could facilitate access to the securitisation market for a broader range of market participants, such as small regional banks or lenders from Member States without an active securitisation market, for whom the cost and complexity of structuring a securitisation might constitute a significant barrier to entry. For established securitisation issuers, a common platform could offer a way to lower structuring costs thereby allowing them to access capital markets on more competitive terms.\n\nFrom an investor\u2019s perspective, a platform can facilitate due diligence by offering a standardized set of products, with common features and risk characteristics. Thus, due diligence for repeat issuances would be simpler and quicker. In addition, for a platform with strict asset eligibility criteria, it is also possible to standardise elements of the credit risk analysis, which is one of the key elements of the due diligence process before investing in securitisation. A platform can also help to dispel any potential stigma against the product among market participants, in particular if the platform is a public or a quasi-public entity. Furthermore, a platform that offers a predictable issuance schedule with high volume can facilitate market liquidity.\n\nAlthough a securitisation platform would not change the applicable rules in the Securitisation Framework, if effectively implemented, it could increase efficiency, lower costs, and improve investor confidence.\n\nA platform can work at an EU-wide level, or it can be more targeted, at a regional or national level. An EU level platform could help integrate EU capital markets. The securitisations issued by such a platform could also serve as a safe asset if the platform is able to issue a sufficiently high volume of low-risk securitisations with common features 192 . A national or regional level platform would be more targeted to the needs of local market players and would be easier to implement from a technical and political standpoint.\n\nPublic guarantees could enhance the attractiveness of securitisation platforms by mitigating risks and encouraging private investment. These guarantees could be provided either at the national or supra-national level, targeting specific tranches within the securitisation structure, provided that such public support, if provided by Member States, can be structured in line with State aid rules. When applied to the senior tranche, guarantees act as a subsidy, ensuring that investors in the most secure portion of the structure face minimal risk. Alternatively, guarantees for the mezzanine tranche serve a de-risking function, absorbing potential losses and thereby making the entire securitisation structure more appealing to private investors.\n\nChallenges that impede the establishment of such platforms include: fragmented legal frameworks (differences in insolvency laws, contract law, and securitisation practices across the EU Member States), lack of standardisation in loan contracts, securitisation structures, and conditions and requirements that assets must meet to be included in a securitisation platform across jurisdictions. These differences complicate asset pooling and act as a drawback to raising investor confidence. Competition with existing instruments like covered bonds could also potentially limit the platform's utility. Additionally, high initial costs for infrastructure development and platform management and pricing and valuation disparities for assets from different jurisdictions, particularly in markets without secondary trading mechanisms would also be significant challenge.\n\nDespite its potential, this policy option is not a preferred avenue for the short-medium term due to underlying challenges. Moreover, legislative action at the EU level is unnecessary to advance this initiative. A market-driven approach would be better suited to explore and refine this idea. This approach allows for flexibility and experimentation without imposing additional regulatory burdens across the EU.\n\nImplementation of a securitisation platform or platforms should consider the interaction with the Securitisation Framework, including both prudential and non-prudential requirements.\n\n\n\n\nAnnex VII: Competitiveness Check\n\n1 - Overview of impacts on competitiveness\n\nDimensions of Competitiveness\n\n\t\n\nImpact of the initiative\n\n(++ / + / 0 / - / -- / n.a.)\n\n\t\n\nReferences to sub-sections of the main report or annexes\n\n\n\n\nCost and price competitiveness\n\n\t\n\n++\n\n\t\n\nSections 7.1; 7.4; Annex III, Section 2\n\n\n\n\nInternational competitiveness\n\n\t\n\n+\n\n\t\n\nSections 1.3; 5.1.1.8; Annex V, Section 3.2\n\n\n\n\nCapacity to innovate\n\n\t\n\n+\n\n\t\n\nAnnexes VIII, IX\n\n\n\n\nSME competitiveness\n\n\t\n\n+\n\n\t\n\nAnnex II, Section 1; Annex XIII\u00a0; Annex VI\n\n2 - Synthetic assessment\n\nThe preferred option presented above has a positive impact on cost and price competitiveness, in that it entails a reduction in capital and compliance costs. The initiative will help European securitisation market participants to improve their cost competitiveness by addressing many of the identified undue barriers to securitisation issuance and investment in both the prudential and non-prudential domains. In particular, it will reduce the costs they will have to bear in complying with the due diligence and transparency requirements compared to the baseline scenario. It will also reduce prudential costs for banks and insurers. While the preferred option does imply some adjustment costs for existing issuers who may have to adapt their reporting systems, these costs should be limited in scale (as the new template would be significantly slimmer than the current set) and time duration. Moreover, any adjustment costs to the new prudential framework will be largely outweighed by the prudential benefits received. For instance, by lowering capital costs via the reduction in capital requirements, it can provide more possibilities for banks and insurers to invest in the real economy and offer higher returns (which could make the firm more attractive for investors and clients).\n\nThe initiative will similarly have a positive impact on international competitiveness, improving the competitive position of EU firms issuing or investing in securitisations with respect to non-EU competitors. Under the baseline scenario, the high operational costs place EU issuers and investors in securitisations at a competitive disadvantage relative to their international counterparts who are not subject to the same requirements of the EU framework. EU investors are subject to the same rules regardless of whether they invest in EU or non-EU securitisation, whereas non-EU investors investing in EU securitisations are not bound by the same rigorous requirements. Similarly, the rigid and burdensome EU Securitisation Framework has a knock-on indirect impact on market acceptance and pricing of European-originated securitisation instruments, which must adhere to EU rules. Adjustments to the legal framework to bring these rules more in line with standard international practice will bolster the price competitiveness of EU securitisation products internationally. In the same manner, a more risk-sensitive and less burdensome prudential framework should make EU banks and insurers more competitive internationally.\n\nThe initiative aims to stimulate a growing and vibrant EU securitisation market that will have a positive impact on the overall capacity to finance EU households and businesses. A more attractive securitisation market could facilitate access to risk capital and financing by freeing up additional lending capacity on the balance sheets of banks and other credit-granting institutions. This would allow economic innovators to access loans more cheaply and readily. This is particularly pertinent within the context of the twin green and digital transition, where billions in additional private risk capital are necessary to finance European innovation in pursuit of the EU\u2019s long-term climate and competitiveness goals.\n\nThe impact of the initiative will also positively impact SME competitiveness. SMEs can benefit from this initiative by being able to obtain loans more cheaply and readily thanks to the additional lending capacity on the balance sheets of banks and other credit-granting institutions facilitated by more securitisation activity (See Annex VIII).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnex VIII: SME Test\n\n1 - Identification of SMEs affected\n\nThe category of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises is defined by the European Commission as enterprises having fewer than 250 employees\u00a0 having either an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million or a balance sheet total not exceeding EUR 43 million. 193 Representing 99% of all businesses in the EU, they are often termed the backbone of the European economy, contributing to job creation, economic growth, and innovation. 194 Although the Securitisation Framework does not specifically target SMEs, its measures will have some direct and mostly indirect impacts on them.\n\nSMEs in general are not active in the securitisation market as either issuers or investors. However, they may benefit from the augmented lending capacity of banks or other financial firms generated by increased EU securitisation activity, or from more favourable and cheaper access to funding. We have also seen concrete cases where innovative companies have used securitisation to roll out ambitious projects (see Annex IX: Examples of impactful securitisation transactions, particularly Example 2: ENPAL).\n\nSMEs constitute an important segment of business customers of credit institutions, insurance firms and asset managers, but SME loan exposures tend to be quite heterogeneous and higher risk than other asset classes. As such, SME loans have not been a popular asset class for securitisation. However, the reduction in operational costs for issuers and investors, improvements in due diligence and transparency, and greater risk sensitivity in prudential treatment of securitisation instruments that this initiative aims to introduce may incentivise greater securitisation across a wider scope of portfolios, including SME loans, and could also lower funding costs. 195\n\n2 - Consultation of SME stakeholders\n\nDuring the consultation procedure all stakeholders, including SMEs, were consulted and were given the opportunity to contribute their views on the development of this policy initiative. The result of all consultation activities is summarised in the Synopsis Report (Annex II). Of the 133 respondents to the targeted public consultation, 33 (25.2%) identified as \u201cSmall\u201d (10 to 49 employees) and 17 (13%) identified as \u201cMedium\u201d (50 to 249 employees). The consultation also had a dedicated section on the topic of SMEs that inquired on how securitisation can support access to SME financing, and impediments to issue or invest in SME loan securitisations.\n\nIn general, respondents pointed out that SMEs have limited access to capital markets due to regulatory complexity, high costs, and poor data quality. Respondents from the industry suggested that simplifying the regulatory framework for securitisation could facilitate SMEs' access to capital markets, while others proposed more targeted changes, such as revising specific articles. However, consumer organisations highlighted the risk of focusing on the potential of securitisation to support SME financing. In their view, promoting securitisation rather than addressing the crucial integration of EU primary debt and equity markets would only entrench the dependence of SME corporates on banks. Increased financing for SMEs via securitisation might crowd out equity financing directly from the market. Instead, these respondents advocated the expansion of existing programs offered by the EIF and EIB.\n\n3 - Impacts on SMEs\n\nSecuritisation can increase the amount of funding available to SMEs, diversify the sources of funding, and promote competition in SME lending 196 .\n\nSMEs can benefit from securitisation by better managing their liquidity by selling trade receivables to a programme of asset-backed commercial paper. Another example is the securitisation of pools of SME loans. Securitisation enables investors to invest in pools of SME loans, allowing SMEs to access capital market funding, and provides a means for investors to gain exposure to the real economy. According to AFME data, SME securitisations comprised around 12% of the total outstanding balance of securitisations in the EU in 2023 (see Table 5 below).\n\nTable 5: Share of outstanding volume of securitisation of SME loans in public securitisations\n\nNote: The calculation of \u2018% of total\u2019 excludes CLOs due to data quality issues\n\nSource: AFME\n\nAdditionally, securitisation can lead to more stable funding for SMEs, as diversifying the sources of finance may make SMEs less vulnerable to banks\u2019 deleveraging in downturns, as capital market investors can provide an alternative source of funding. Furthermore, securitisation can promote the entry of 'challenger banks' and non-bank financial institutions into the SME lending market, increasing competition and potentially leading to better terms and conditions for SMEs. Overall, a well-functioning SME securitisation market can have a positive impact on SME finance and the broader economy 197 .\n\nAt EU level, the European Investment Fund has historically supported the SME securitisation market, with a focus in particular on the following asset classes: i) SME loans, ii) SME loan guarantees, iii) small ticket lease receivables, iv) SME trade receivables, v) venture financing and vi) micro loans. 198\n\nThe overall distribution of potential costs and benefits of the proposal is analysed in Annex 3. It is impossible at this stage to quantitively estimate, with a reasonable degree of accuracy, the benefits accruing to the SME subgroup, due to the uncertainty as to direct and indirect benefits that would arise for SMEs.\n\nIn general, increased European securitisation activity is expected to give rise to significant benefits for capital market participants but the extent to which they materialise will depend on industry take-up and market willingness to issue and invest further in SME securitisation products. A reduction in operational costs brought about by the non-prudential simplification measures is expected to give rise to market improvements in terms of less burdensome and more cost-effective securitisation for all parties to the transaction, including SME credit holders and small banks.\n\nAll of the options presented in the Impact Assessment aim to reduce barriers to securitisation issuance and investment and will likely have indirect downstream positive benefits on SMEs through the positive impacts presented above.\n\n4 - Options to mitigate any negative impacts on SMEs\n\nWe have not identified any material negative impacts from the proposed policy options on SMEs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2: Enpal Launches Europe's First Public Residential Solar ABS Transaction, Raising EUR 240 Million\n\nIn October 2024, Enpal, a German green-energy startup specialised in rooftop solar systems and heat pumps, sponsored Europe\u2019s first public residential solar ABS transaction. The EUR 240 million deal is backed by a portfolio of some 8,500 loans to German residential homeowners for solar power systems.\n\nThis transaction adheres to European Green Bond principles, is publicly rated, meets STS criteria under the Securitisation Regulation and its notes were sold to over 17 European investors. The transaction was led and structured and led by Citi as sole arranger, and the securitised notes were publicly traded and cleared on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.\n\nThe EIB acted as an anchor investor with EUR 50 million. The EIF provided an additional EUR 50 embedded guarantee of the Class A1 notes. Investor demand for the deal greatly surpassed expectations, with tranches reportedly oversubscribed up to six times.\n\nThe tranching and pricing of Enpal\u2019s pioneering EUR 240m Green ABS transaction\n\n\n\n\nExample 3: EIB-backed Santander transaction releases additional lending to Spanish SMEs and midcaps\n\nIn May 2024, the EIB Group invested EUR 530 million in a Banco Santander securitisation operation. EUR 440 million of the EIB investment was in the senior tranche, which comprised almost 80% of the securitised structure. EUR 60 million was allocated to non-investment grade tranches.\n\nIn return, Santander agreed to originate double the amount of the EIB Group\u2019s original investment (EUR 1.2 billion) in new loans to Spanish SMEs and mid-caps, which are vital to driving economic growth and innovation.\n\nThe European Investment Fund contributed EUR 30 million, which is linked to the creation of an additional EUR 60 million loan portfolio by Santander. At least 50% of the loans in this portfolio will go to Spanish SMEs and mid-caps implementing projects in the areas of environment and climate action, energy efficiency and women\u2019s entrepreneurship. 30% of the new loans should target sustainable investments and 20% should aim at \u201cgender-balanced financing\u201d, such as companies run by women entrepreneurs.\n\nIt is estimated that over half of the final beneficiaries of the agreement are in cohesion regions, where per capita income is below the EU average. In this way, the operation will promote fair growth and convergence between EU regions, a key objective of the EIB\u2019s lending\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnex X: Comparison of securitisation and covered bonds\n\n(Traditional) securitisation is often compared with covered bonds, as they have some common features (they use the same type of underlying assets, in particular residential mortgages, and have similar objectives, both being used by banks as funding instruments i.e. instrument used as a source of funding).\n\nThere are also some structural differences resulting in different risk characteristics of both instruments and different levels of security provided to the investors.\n\nIn particular, the covered bonds are characterised by the so-called \u2018dual recourse\u2019, i.e. two lines of recourse that are activated sequentially, first toward the issuer (the bank) and second, once the bank has defaulted, toward the cash flows generated by the underlying assets (i.e. mortgages). The dual recourse feature provides better alignment of the incentives between the originator and the investor, compared to the more limited recourse in case of securitisations. Should the bank default on its obligations, investors have recourse to the pool of underlying assets, which increases the security for the investor and ensures a stable flow of payments to the investors. Securitisation is intended to be delinked from the repayment capability of the bank, and liabilities are expected to be met principally by the cash flows generated from the segregated underlying assets. Any losses beyond these are to be borne by the investors.\n\nCovered bond is a pure funding tool and does not allow to transfer the risk out of the balance sheet of the issuer (while securitisation allows this, thereby freeing up banks\u2019 balance sheet capacity). Covered bonds are no substitute for securitisation in this regard as the credit risk of the loan pool covered by a covered bond remains on issuing bank\u2019s balance sheet, and hence, no additional capacity to make new loans is generated. Covered bonds are therefore only comparable with traditional securitisation (the funding function of it), and not with synthetic securitisation (which has no funding function). Covered bonds are also more easily structured than securitisation.\n\nWhile covered bonds play an important role in bank funding, an over-reliance on them leads to higher asset encumbrance and restricts further the banks\u2019 flexibility to manage their balance sheets. Instead, encouraging a more balanced funding mix, including securitisation, would help improve capital efficiency and support a deeper and more integrated European capital market.\n\nIn terms of market and regulatory developments, covered bonds have been historically preferred by both regulators and market participants. Banks often favour the use of covered bonds for their funding purposes, which are generally subject to less stringent regulatory requirements in terms of disclosure, due diligence, capital, resolution and liquidity. For example, covered bonds are subject to much less stringent regulatory disclosure and due diligence requirements (e.g. only portfolio level disclosure is required for covered bonds, in contrast to loan level disclosure required for securitisations). Also, covered bonds are exempted from the scope of the bail-in instrument in the resolution framework (securitisations are not) and are eligible under Level 1, 2A and 2B of liquid assets in the LCR (securitisations are eligible under Level 2B liquid assets). In terms of capital requirements, the bank investor in premium covered bonds treated as CQS1 (AAA and AA) can apply a risk weight of 10% to their covered bonds investment under the Standardised Approach, which is comparable to the risk weights applied to an exposure to a senior tranche of a STS securitisation under the Standardised Approach (where the framework allows the 10% risk weight floor). \u2018Real\u2019 risk weights for senior tranches can be higher than the risk weight floors. Also, the minimum risk weight for senior tranches for non-STS securitisations are 15% or higher (e.g. can also reach 75%). The risk weights for mezzanine tranches are significantly higher (for example they can be around 800% higher). The risk weight for a first loss tranche is normally 1250% (i.e. full capitalisation).\n\nAs shown in the figure 1 below, covered bonds issuance has been increasing, while issuance of RMBS (traditional securitisation using residential mortgages as underlying assets) is substantially lower than in pre-GFC period. Overall, between end-2007 and end 2023, the RMBS issuance decreased by half from EUR 199 bn to EUR 97 bn, while the issuance of covered bonds has increased from EUR 296 bn to EUR 334 bn during the same period.\n\nFigure 1: Issuance of Euro-area traditional and synthetic securitisation, and of covered bonds (EUR bn notional)\n\nSource: JP Morgan, Bloomberg Finance L.P., ECB Banking Supervision, European Covered Bond Council and ECB calculations. Notes: CLO issuance refers to EU ex United Kingdom. Synthetic securitisation issuance refers to issuance by significant institutions supervised by the ECB; available data start in 2018.\n\nSecuritisation and covered bonds are used by banks as complementary tools. Currently, as mentioned above, banks use covered bonds for secured funding, while they use synthetic securitisations for risk transfer and regulatory capital relief. Traditional securitisation has ceded the place to synthetic securitisation as tool for risk transfer.\n\nAll in all, any comparison between these two instruments should therefore take into account both the similarities as well as structural differences of both instruments, among other considerations. It is difficult to assess the impact of the proposed changes to the securitisation framework on the covered bonds market (and is also outside of the scope of this exercise). Removal of regulatory barriers for securitisation is expected to raise the attractiveness of the securitisation instrument for both issuers and investors; however concrete impact on the issuer and investor preferences and final issuance and investment volumes is difficult to predict. The issuance of securitisation also does not need to happen necessarily at the expense of covered bonds, as these are just two instruments out of several that banks can use for their funding purposes. Finally, it should be noted that an assessment of the EU covered bond framework is subject to a separate exercise; the Commission addressed a call for advice to the EBA to assess the performance of the EU covered bond framework and invited the EBA to provide its response in June 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnex XI: Further details on the assessment of impact of insurance options\n\n1 - Detailed assessment of stakeholder impact\n\nIn all three options for insurance, the direct beneficiaries would be insurance companies, as they would be subject to less demanding capital requirements. The extent of such a benefit depends on the level of alleviation of capital requirements. The most favourable scenario for insurers would be Option 3.3, which would result in both the highest decrease in capital requirements (compared with the current rules) and the widest scope of securitisations concerned (all of them). The difference between Options 3.1 and 3.2 is more difficult to quantify as according to EIOPA, there is no available data on the split between senior and non-senior non-STS holdings by insurers that could further substantiate the analysis.\n\n\u00b7\nIf insurers mainly hold senior non-STS securitisations, then Option 3.2 is more favourable than Option 3.1 (as the capital relief on such investments is more significant);\n\n\u00b7\nIf insurers mainly hold non-senior non-STS securitisations, then Option 3.1 is more favourable than Option 3.2 (as there would be lower capital requirements on such investments under Option 3.1, whereas there would not be any under Option 3.2.).\n\nDepending on the way they use this \u2018capital relief\u2019, there might be additional beneficiaries:\n\n\u00b7\nIf insurers decide to leverage on the capital relief by increasing investments in securitisation, this would be likely based on the expectations of higher return on investments. Banks would also enjoy a more significant investor base (demand) for their supply of securitisation. This would mean more opportunities to transfer credit risk to markets through origination of securitisation, and ultimately stronger ability to provide financing mainly to households and businesses. This would achieve the second specific objectives of this initiative and could stimulate loan origination. Under Options 3.1 and 3.2 (focused on non-STS investments), loan origination would likely benefit mainly corporate borrowers whereas under Option 3.3 (which covers both STS and non-STS investments), loan origination would also benefit household borrowers 199 .\n\n\u00b7\nIf insurers use the capital relief to invest in other assets than securitisation, depending on the asset class concerned, this might also support the long-term financing of the economy (e.g. more equity investments). Therefore, businesses may eventually benefit from any of the three options even if insurers do not increase their investments in securitisation. If insurers decide to opportunistically proceed to ad-hoc dividend distributions as an outcome of any of the three options, shareholders of insurance companies (very diverse) would be ultimately benefiting from any of the Options. There would be no contribution to reviving securitisation and insurers would be less financially robust (due to the depletion of capital), implying greater risk (of insolvency) for policyholders and higher financial stability risks, though moderate in view of the current very low level of insurers\u2019 holdings of securitisation investments 200 .\n\nRegarding policyholders, if insurers use the capital relief to either remunerate shareholders or increase investments in securitisation, this would imply a lower level of protection for the same or higher level of risk taken by insurance companies (i.e. higher risk of insurance failure \u2013 though remaining moderate). This risk would be all the more likely when the capital relief is significant (i.e. more significant under Option 3.3). Note that Option 3.2 is the option with the fewest downsides for policyholder protection. Indeed, by only decreasing capital requirements for senior tranches (i.e. the tranches with lower risks), Option 3.2 would remove the existing incentive for \u2018excessive\u2019 risk taking by insurers (current rules apply the same capital requirements for both senior and non-senior non-STS securitisations, which can incentivise insurers to invest in the lower-ranking tranches as they would likely provide higher returns for the same level of capital requirements). In the specific case of life insurers, the higher risk taking may eventually also benefit policyholders, as any higher return on insurers\u2019 investment portfolio would have to be (partly) shared with policyholders (so-called \u2018profit participation\u2019). In other terms, life policyholders, while being exposed to some higher risk of insolvency of their insurer, could also get better return on their savings.\n\nThe effect of the options on supervisors depends on the extent of capital relief, and the robustness of the technical basis supporting the changes implied by each of the three options. Indeed, any lowering of capital requirements for the same level of actual risks which is not sufficiently backed by strong technical basis means that supervisors\u2019 ability to exercise their prerogatives in accordance with their mandate would be more constrained (i.e. lower ability to intervene timely in case of deteriorating financial position) \u2013 all else equal 201 . The next sub-sections will illustrate that supervisors would be the worst off under Option 3.3. On the contrary they would be less affected under Option 3.2 where changes are driven by improvements to risk sensitivity.\n\n2 - Detailed discussion of implementation costs\n\nAs explained above, Option 3.1 is very simple to implement. Options 3.2 and 3.3 require some additional updates to IT systems.\n\n\u00b7\nOption 3.2 would require introducing additional inputs to calculate capital requirements which would also have to be reported to supervisors, as insurers would be required to differentiate between senior and non-senior tranches of non-STS securitisations.\n\n\u00b7\nOption 3.3 would require changing the classification of capital requirements securitisations from market risk to counterparty default risk, but the type of change implied is expected to be relatively seamless (and therefore not costly).\n\nFor this reason, the one-off administrative (implementation) costs are expected to be limited for all three options. Option 3.2 would generate an additional permanent administrative cost as insurers would have to consistently monitor and differentiate their exposures to senior and non-senior tranches of non-STS securitisations. However, this information is actually expected to be already monitored by insurers as part of their own investment management policies and strategies.\n\nSimilarly, the digital supervisory tools used by national authorities would have to be adapted to reflect the described changes. Those costs are expected to be negligible in the long-term.\n\nTherefore, overall, implementation costs for all three options\u00a0would be moderate (Option 3.1 would be the least costly and Option 3.2 the costliest) and would likely be expressed in million or tens of million euros for the whole market, which would be significantly lower than the capital benefit (lower capital requirements) which is of several billion euros. Therefore, such costs do not appear to be the decisive factor when assessing the preferred option and this is confirmed by stakeholders as part of the Commission services\u2019 consultation activities.\n\n\nAnnex XII: Comparison of Due Diligence and Transparency Requirements\n\nTable 1: Comparison of due diligence requirements for selected entities when investing in selected products\n\nDue Diligence Requirements for AIFMs\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\nOther instruments (covered bonds, funds of funds, high yield bonds, etc.)\n\n\t\n\nSecuritisation\n\n\n\n\nVerification requirements\n\n\t\n\nNo explicit verification requirements for issuer compliance with sectoral legislation of the issuer.\n\nLegal basis: Article 15(2) and (3) of AIFMD.

Similarly, the ECB Governing Council statement of 7 March 2024 suggested exploring the use of public guarantees and further standardisation of securitisation issuances. The European Council conclusions of 18 April 2024 called to relaunch the European securitisation market, including through regulatory and prudential changes. The European Council conclusions of June 2024 called again on the Council and the Commission to accelerate work on all identified measures under the Capital Markets Union.\n\n(19)\n\nAction by Member States and industry, in particular in those countries where issuance is limited, would help issuers, investors, supervisors and the local legal community to develop platforms to encourage the issuance of securitisation.\n\n(20)\n\n\u00a0See: EU competitiveness - European Commission\n\n(21)\n\nThe term \u2018prudential cost\u2019 is probably not fully accurate. It is used in this impact assessment for the sake of simplicity although it should not be assimilated to an \u2018accounting cost\u2019. In fact, both banks and insurers are subject to \u2018risk-based\u2019 capital requirements. These funding requirements determine how much capital financial institutions should hold to cover the risks arising from their investments. Capital requirements are a necessary feature of prudential rules to protect policyholders and depositors by limiting the risk of failure of an insurer or a bank. The use of the term \u2018prudential cost\u2019 does not mean that capital requirements are undesirable or that the ultimate objective of any initiative on securitisation should be to set all capital requirements to (almost) zero. At the same time, capital requirements still can act as a limiting factor in insurers\u2019 and banks\u2019 ability to invest in and/or issue securitisation. Therefore, by referring to \u2018prudential costs\u2019, the impact assessment simply underlines that the appropriateness of the calibration of capital requirements needs to be reassessed, without challenging the existence of such requirements.\n\n(22)\n\nSee academic paper that shows that low policy interest rates decrease the cost of funding, thus reducing bank incentives to securitise loans.

Further details can be found in Annex III.\n\n(29)\n\nFurther evidence on this can be found in Annex III.\n\n(30)\n\nPrivate securitisations are exempted from having to report to the public securitisation repositories. However, they need to make the same information available as public securitisation, using the same format.\n\n(31)\n\nNon-neutrality of bank securitisation capital requirements means that holding all the securitisation tranches in a securitisation is subject to a higher capital charge than a direct holding of all the underlying assets as if not securitised.\n\n(32)\n\nThe US market is less bank-centric than the EU market, allowing non-bank entities to play a more significant role as originators of securitisation. This is in contrast to the EU, where the bank-centric nature of the market leads to banks dominating as originators. Moreover in the US, government agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a prominent role, further reducing the influence of traditional banks as originators.\n\n(33)\n\nBanks are only allowed to reduce their capital requirements when the supervisor acknowledges that the securitisation transfers a significant amount of risk to third party investors \u2013 this is known as Significant Risk Transfer\u2019. The SRT framework sets out several requirements and tests, based on which the supervisors assess whether the significant risk transfer has been achieved.\n\n(34)\n\nIn particular, a difference of less than two percentage points in capital requirements cannot on its own justify why corporate bonds represent more than 15% of insurers\u2019 portfolio whereas senior STS requirements make up less than 0.5%.\n\n(35)\n\nSee: https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/publications/joint-committee-advice-review-securitisation-prudential-framework_en \u00a0\n\n(36)\n\nSee for instance \u201cEuropean SF Weekly: European vs US insurers\u2019 asset mix\u201d, BofA Global Research, 24 June 2024. As public authorities and supervisors did not collect data on a consistent basis over time (Solvency II only applies since 2016), it is not possible to confirm or infirm the validity of this assessment.\n\n(37)\n\nSee: https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/capital-markets-special-reports-asset-mix-ye2023.pdf\n\n(38)\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Draghi report p. 59, Chapter 5: \u201cFinancing Investment\u201d.\n\n(39)\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0See Buffer use and lending impact ; Borsuk, Budnik, Volk, 2020\u00a0\n\n(40)\n\nExamples of such differences include the presence of government-sponsored agencies and the role of the central bank in securitisation markets, the absence of alternative instruments, like covered bonds, the particularities of the insolvency and corporate tax regimes, etc.\n\n(41)\n\nAssuming that the bank originator manages to transfer a significant amount of risk to third parties (i.e. it achieves Significant Risk Transfer - see Section 6.2 for more detailed explanation).\n\n(42)\n\nConcretely, this would mean that EU investors would no longer have to check that EU sell side parties comply with the credit granting criteria, risk retention requirements, disclosure requirements or STS criteria.\n\n(43)\n\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35\n\n(44)\n\nThe calibration follows a similar approach as for STS calibration in 2017. As the improvement concerns the senior tranches only, the corresponding reduction in risk factors is more significant than under Option 3.1. This makes the ratio of senior-to-non senior non-STS securitisation capital requirements broadly more coherent with banking rules.\n\n(45)\n\nFrictions between supply and demand, liquidity risks, unexpected credit risk premium, risk of rating downgrade, etc.\n\n(46)\n\nWe assume a reduction in capital requirements of the same magnitude as in Option 3.2, but applied to all tranches and types of securitisations.\n\n(47)\n\nAlthough the subscribers are mainly non-insurers.\n\n(48)\n\nAccording to the AFME Securitisation data report for Q4 2023, 96.6% of public securitisation notes rated by Moody\u2019s are rated investment grade and 86.7% received the two highest credit ratings of AA or AAA.\n\n(49)\n\nRepeat transactions are estimated to about 67% of public market transactions by AFME, see https://www.afme.eu/Portals/0/DispatchFeaturedImages/Article%205%20presentation%20for%20Commission%2015.1.25.pdf\n\n(50)\n\nAnecdotal evidence provided in the stakeholder consultation suggests that secondary market transactions make about 50% of the transaction volume in public securitisation markets.\n\n(51)\n\n\u00a0AFME, https://www.afme.eu/Portals/0/DispatchFeaturedImages/Article%205%20presentation%20for%20Commission%2015.1.25.pdf .\n\n(52)\n\nThis savings potential is the result of a more complex analysis that is presented in detail in Annex III.\n\n(53)\n\nMore details for the cost estimations are in Annex III.\n\n(54)\n\nWe refrain from a market cost estimation for private issuers as the number of private issuers currently cannot be determined as they are not obliged to report to public repositories. We can assume however that there is an overlap of issuers that operate in both segments, public and private.\n\n(55)\n\nThe rates are published by the securitisation repositories on their websites.\n\n(56)\n\nDetails in Annex III.\n\n(57)\n\nE.g. xlsx instead of xml only\n\n(58)\n\nThe SECR establishes a system of third-party verification entities to assist both issuers and investors, on a voluntary basis, in assessing the compliance of a transaction with the STS criteria. However, the involvement of such verifiers does not remove the legal responsibility from institutional investors to perform due diligence on the investment and investors remain liable for their obligations under the regulation. These third-party verification entities are authorised by the respective national competent authority of the Member State in which they are incorporated. Two third-party verifiers have been authorised so far. To date, most STS transactions have used the services of one of the two third-party verifiers.\n\n(59)\n\n\u00a0 Report of the Financial Stability Forum on Enhancing Market and Institutional Resilience , April 2008\n\n(60)\n\nOnly by transferring a sufficient amount of risk (by selling tranches to an external investor or obtaining a credit protection for certain tranches) can an originator bank achieve capital requirements which are the same or lower than those previously held against the underlying assets.\n\n(61)\n\nThe safeguards are: (i) minimum thickness of first loss/mezzanine tranche that protects the senior tranche from losses, (ii) minimum granularity of asset pool, (iii) sequential amortisation, and (iv) funded credit protection (in case of synthetic securitisations only). With the exception of the first one, the safeguards are existing criteria for STS purposes (i.e. defined in the Securitisation Regulation or in the Article 243 of the CRR).\n\n(62)\n\n\u00a0A specific type of traditional securitisations (currently representing a majority of traditional securitisations in the market) are transactions where the bank does not sell but retains the senior tranche and uses is as collateral to access central bank funding (these transactions do not meet SRT rules and the securitisation prudential framework is not relevant because the originator bank has to continue to apply the credit risk framework for calculating capital for the whole underlying portfolio).\n\n(63)\n\nThese estimates might be inflated.\n\n(64)\n\nTherefore, the effect on the banks\u2019 lending channel from increased securitisation should not be dampened by the fact that a large share of traditional securitisation transactions are retained on the banks\u2019 balance sheet.\n\n(65)\n\nThe current risk weight function is a combination of two elements: first, the requirement for a full one-to-one capitalisation (1250% RW) for the most risky tranches until a certain \u2018cliff\u2018 point, and then a steep decrease of the risk weights as a function of the (p) factor, for mezzanine and senior tranches. The inverted S-curve function could allow to eliminate the cliff point and mitigate the cliff effects in the risk weights across all the tranches in securitisation. Scaling KA downwards would be possible within the current halfpipe design, while it would still create a cliff effect at the cliff point KA. Both options could possibly achieve the targets of a moderate capital non-neutrality and still achieve high risk weights for lower tranches.\n\n(66)\n\nFor instance, same allocation of ratings and durations between STS and non-STS securitisations, similar relative shares of senior and non-senior tranches for non-STS as in STS, assumption that ratings BBB and lower are non-senior, etc.\n\n(67)\n\nOne can argue that this implies reducing the scope of the assessment, as the risk of default is only one of the drivers of \u2018spread risk\u2019 (i.e. risk of volatility in the value of the investment).\n\n(68)\n\nAssets that are held to maturity are reflected in insurers\u2019 disclosures as assets \u2018valued at amortised cost\u2019.\n\n(69)\n\nOn the other hand, introducing safeguards in the context of Option 3 would remove one of the main \u2018benefits\u2019 of such option, namely its simplicity.\n\n(70)\n\nIn fact, this inconsistency would result in capital charges for securitisations that are even lower than those of the underlying assets. This would breach the \u2018non-neutrality\u2019 principle as capital requirements on securitisation would no longer reflect the additional risks that such investments entail, namely agency and model risks.\n\n(71)\n\nOne has to acknowledge that banking rules also apply default risk to some securitised assets \u2013 those which are part of the so-called \u2018banking book\u2019, i.e. assets held to maturity. Against this background, Option 3.3 could be seen as improving coherence with banking rules (to the extent that insurers\u2019 investments are held to maturity, which is not substantiated as discussed above). However, Option 3.3 would not reflect the many sophisticated parameters and methods underlying these banking capital requirements. Attempting such level of sophistication would require extensive work, all the more that the risk metrics and applicable \u2018confidence levels\u2019 underlying capital requirements in the two frameworks is different. Such sophistication would also generate extensive complexity that is not commensurate to the importance of this asset class in insurers\u2019 portfolios. Therefore, while under Option 3.3 insurers and banks would be expected to measure the very same risks when investing in securitisation, the risk measurement would in practice materially differ (due to the much simpler approach of Option 3.3 when comparing with banking rules). In other words, Option 3.3 does not effectively improve coherence with banking rules\n\n(72)\n\nIndeed, capital requirements on non-STS securitisations would be calibrated such that they remain higher those on STS securitisations. With Option 3.2, the \u2018ranking\u2019 of capital requirements from the lowest to the highest would be as follows:\n\n\u00b7\nLowest capital requirements: senior STS\n\n\u00b7\nSecond lowest capital requirements: non-senior STS\n\n\u00b7\nThird lowest capital requirement: senior non-STS\n\n\u00b7\nHighest capital requirements: non-senior non-STS\n\n(73)\n\nOne has to acknowledge that securitisation brings significant diversification benefits in comparison with an exposure to a single bond or loan. Conversely, it may also bring specific agency and modelling risks. In any case, such features do not justify why the measurement of risk (spread risk vs. default risk) should differ between corporate or covered bonds and securitisations.\n\n(74)\n\nThat Opinion has been published and is available at [OP PLEASE INSERT LINK TO THE RSB OPINION].

Furthermore, it reports Asset Backed Commercial Paper of EUR 123.2 with an estimated EU share of 74%, i.e. EUR 103.2 in absolute terms.

Assuming, a constant absolute number of issuers leaving the market over time (i.e. 10 per year), an estimated 60 issuers were still active in the time period 2019 (inception of SECR to today), we obtain in total 230 issuers, scaled up from 90% to 100%, we obtain 260 issuers.

For the purpose of computing capital requirements for securitisations, insurers using an internal model are relatively autonomous in their assessment of market and credit risks (subject to prior supervisory approval), while \u201cstandard formula\u201d insurers have no discretion.\n\n(148)\n\n\u00a0The capital requirements for \u2018type 2\u2019 securitisations were in line with EIOPA\u2019s proposed calibration in 2013.

Only by transferring a sufficient amount of risk (by selling tranches to an external investor or obtaining a credit protection for certain tranches) can an originator bank achieve capital requirements which are the same or lower than those previously held against the underlying assets.\n\n(159)\n\nBanks use one of the CRR-prescribed \u2019approaches\u2019 when calculating the capital requirements for their securitisation position, following the \u2019hierarchy\u2019 or approaches prescribed in the CRR (i.e. the selection of an approach is not discretionary). The previous framework contained a number of approaches and several exceptional treatments. The current framework includes three hierarchical approaches: SEC-IRBA (Securitisation Internal Ratings-Based Approach) is at the top of the revised hierarchy. When SEC-IRBA cannot be used, SEC-SA (Securitisation Standardised Approach) and SEC-ERBA (Securitisation External Ratings-Based Approach) have to be used.\n\n(160)\n\nDetails in Annex III. Please note that in particular the private market segment might be incomplete as there is no systematic public reporting due to the private nature of the transactions in this segment.\n\n(161)\n\nReason for this focus is that the EBA has the most comprehensive dataset (CoREP statistics) that allows breaking down the market with consistent definitions across the different dimensions (i.e. STS/non-STS; public/private; SRT/non-SRT; synthetic/traditional and across asset classes). However, the limitation of the EBA dataset is that certain transactions without bank involvement cannot be covered.\n\n(162)\n\n\u00a0See for example European_securitisation_market_\u2013_ready_for_a_comeb.pdf\n\n(163)\n\nReflected in CoREP statistics.\n\n(164)\n\nBloomberg, ECB calculations.\n\n(165)\n\nStructured financial product that pools together a portfolio of corporate loans - typically leveraged loans - and then tranches them into different layers of risk and return for investors.\n\n(166)\n\nSource: TSI_BVB_Final_report_of_the_securitisation_task_force_202409_en.pdf\n\n(167)\n\n\u00a0ESRB, Fernando Gonzalez, Cristina Morar Triandafil, Occasional Paper Series No. 23, The European significant risk transfer securitisation market \u00a0Table 2.\n\n(168)\n\nDetails of this estimate can be found in Annex III in the section on one-off due diligence costs.\n\n(169)\n\nSource: AFME\n\n(170)\n\n\u00a0 JC 2022 66 - JC Advice on the review of the securitisation prudential framework - Banking.pdf\n\n(171)\n\nUnlike the US, Japan, Australia and Canada where re-securitisation is still permitted.\n\n(172)\n\n\u00a0The EBA acknowledges the reduction in model and agency risk associated with some specific securitisation transactions (transactions associated to originators retaining senior securitisation tranches, subject to safeguards ensuring resilience of transactions), and advices some targeted measures to improve risk sensitivity in the capital prudential framework. JC 2022 66 - JC Advice on the review of the securitisation prudential framework - Banking.pdf\n\n(173)\n\nApart from that, there are discrepancies between the rules applied under the securitisation internal-rating based approach (SEC-IRBA) and securitisation standardised approach (SEC-SA), resulting in undue discrepancies between the capital requirements for the same securitisation, when used by different types of banks. Divergencies also exist between the prudential and regulatory treatment of the securitisations and other comparable funding tools, such as covered bonds.\n\n(174)\n\nand can be even higher, depending on the approach used for the calculation of capital.\n\n(175)\n\nOther identified shortcomings include lack of clear safeguards against the use of tranches with insufficient thickness, lack of additional requirements to assess the sustainability of the SRT, limited focus on the commensurateness of the transferred risk, and other specific limitations of each test.\n\n(176)\n\n\u00a0 Microsoft Word - EBA Report on SRT.docx\n\n(177)\n\nBased on data from EBA, 63% of all SRT transactions are synthetic transactions (93% of synthetic transactions apply and achieve SRT).

Depending on the data source, these vary slightly.\n\n(180)\n\nThe uncertainty stems from inconsistencies in insurers\u2019 reported data, which vary depending on the quantitative reporting template based on which the Commission services\u2019 assessment is made\n\n(181)\n\nSource: BofA Global Research\n\n(182)\n\n\u00a0Source: EIOPA\u2019s statistics\n\n(183)\n\nIn fact, the STS calibrations for Solvency II precisely aimed at ensuring sufficient consistency with the requirements under the banking external ratings-based approach (SEC-ERBA), which is technically the closest to Solvency II rules and allows for the most \u2018straightforward\u2019 comparison.\n\n(184)\n\nSee: https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/publications/joint-committee-advice-review-securitisation-prudential-framework_en\n\n(185)\n\n\u00a0 Summary of responses - Targeted consultation on the functioning of the EU securitisation framework\n\n(186)\n\nStatistics from European Data Warehouse, the largest securitisation repository in the EU.\n\n(187)\n\n\u00a0 https://eurodw.eu/solutions/pricing/\n\n(188)\n\nSource: https://pcsmarket.org/wp-content/uploads/Fee-Schedule.pdf and STS verification - STS Verification International GmbH\n\n(189)\n\nCommission Communication\u00a0: \u00ab\u00a0A Competitiveness Compass for the EU\u00a0\u00bb , 29 January 2025, https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/10017eb1-4722-4333-add2-e0ed18105a34_en .\n\n(190)\n\nSee EIOPA\u2019s Technical Report on Standard Formula Design and Calibration for Certain Long-Term Investments: https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/consultations/standard-formula-design-and-calibration-certain-long-term-investments_en\n\n(191)\n\nFor example, see Noyer\u2019s \u00a0and TSI-KFW reports.\n\n(192)\n\nFor more details see the Noyer\u2019s report.\n\n(193)\n\nRecommendation 2003/361.\n\n(194)\n\nhttps://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/smes/sme-fundamentals/sme-definition_en\n\n(195)\n\nConcretely, as regards the prudential treatment, the introduction of the risk sensitive floor for senior tranches allows the capital requirements for securitisation to reflect the SME supported factor, embedded in the capital requirements for the underlying SME loans. This is currently not possible, because the current risk weight floor for senior tranches is flat and does not reflect the riskiness (capital requirements) of the underlying exposures. Also the reduction of the (p) factor should lead to lower capital requirements for securitisations, including of the securitisations of SME loans.\n\n(196)\n\n\u00a0 Revitalizing Securitization for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in Europe - Euro Area; by Shekhar Aiyar, Ali Al-Eyd, Bergljot Barkbu, and Andreas A.

Such powers are only available under exceptional sector-wide shocks (like the Covid-19 crisis) to protect policyholders of companies which present a vulnerable risk profile\n\n(201)\n\nA simple example can make it more concrete. Assume that under current rules, the solvency capital requirement of a company is 100. This means that where insurers\u2019 own funds fall below this value, supervisors can take supervisory measures so that insurers restore compliance with capital requirements and avoid insolvency. If, as an outcome of Option 1, the solvency capital requirement becomes 95, this means that a supervisor would not be able to require an increase of own funds where their value falls down to e.g. 97. Under Option 1, supervisors would only be able to intervene one own funds fall below 95, i.e. a situation where the depletion of own funds is more severe than now.\n\nTop\nThis site is managed by the Publications Office of the European Union\nNeed help?\nHelp pages\nContact\nSitemap\nFollow us\n X\nLegal\nLegal notice\nCookies policy\nAccessibility\nPrivacy statement\nInformation\nAbout EUR-Lex\nNewsletter\nUseful links\nOther services\nEuropean Data\nEU tenders\nEU research results\nEU Whoiswho\nEU publications\nN-Lex\nEU Law Tracker\nDiscover more on europa.eu\nContact the EU\nCall us 00 800 6 7 8 9 10 11\nUse other telephone options\nWrite to us via our contact form\nMeet us at one of the EU centres\nSocial media\nSearch for EU social media channels\nLegal\nLanguages on our websites\nPrivacy policy\nLegal notice\nCookies\nEU institutions\nEuropean Parliament\nEuropean Council\nCouncil of the European Union\nEuropean Commission\nCourt of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB)\nEuropean Court of Auditors\nEuropean External Action Service (EEAS)\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee\nEuropean Committee of Regions (CoR)\nEuropean Investment Bank\nEuropean Ombudsman\nEuropean Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS)\nEuropean Data Protection Board\nEuropean Personnel Selection Office\nPublications Office of the European Union\nAgencies",

That is more important than ever in the current economic and geopolitical environment where the Union faces significant investment needs to remain resilient and competitive. Well-functioning securitisation markets can contribute to higher economic growth and facilitate funding of Union strategic objectives, including investments in the green, digital and social transition, by allowing banks to transfer risks to those that are best suited to bear them and thereby free up their capital. Banks are expected to use this capital for additional lending to households and businesses, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). By redistributing risk within the wider financial system, securitisation can also provide capital market investors with more investment opportunities. The current EU securitisation framework is keeping the EU economy from reaping many of the benefits that securitisation can offer.\n\nThe reports from Enrico Letta[1](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote2) and Mario Draghi[2](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote3)have recommended securitisation as a means of strengthening the lending capacity of European Union\u2019s banks for the financing needs of EU priorities including defence, creating deeper capital markets, building the Savings and Investments Union and increasing the EU\u2019s competitiveness.\n\nThe European Council has asked the European Commission to identify measures to relaunch the European securitisation market, including \u201cthrough regulatory and prudential changes, using available room for manoeuvre\u201d[3](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote4) and to swiftly propose, in 2025, a revised securitisation framework[4](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote5). There is also a call for action by many stakeholders, including issuers,investors and supervisors, to address barriers that are hindering the development of the EU securitisation market[5](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote6).\n\nThe EU securitisation framework was put in place in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and responded to concerns about risky US securitisations. At the time, strict requirements were considered necessary to restore the reputation of the securitisation market which had been suffering from inadequate protections and severe investor distrust. Now that appropriate safeguards have been firmly embedded in the market\u2019s organisation and securitisation is gaining back investors\u2019 trust, a better balance between safeguards and growth opportunities - both for investments and issuance- needs to be found. The experience with the framework indicates that it is too conservative and limits the potential use of securitisations in the EU. High operational costs and overly conservative capital requirements keep many issuers and investors out of the securitisation market.\n\nThe review aims to recognise the risk mitigants implemented in the EU securitisation regulatory and supervisory frameworks, which have significantly reduced the risks embedded in securitisation transactions, as well as the good credit performance of EU securitisations. This proposal contributes to the 2024-2029 Commission\u2019s priority of \u2018A new plan for Europe\u2019s sustainable prosperity and competitiveness\u2019. Th e proposal is a component of the Savings and Investments Union[6](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote7), which is a cornerstone of the 2024-2029 Commission mandate, and it is the first legislative initiative under the Savings and Investments Union.At the same time, it is important to recognise that the Securitisation Review is not a \u2018silver bullet\u2019 on its own. The SIU project encompasses a broad range of other and complementary measures to achieve its goals.Nevertheless, the European Commission expects that the amendments to the non-prudential and prudential requirements envisaged in this package of proposals will lead financial institutions to engage in more securitisation activity and, importantly, to use the resultant capital relief for additional lending.\n\nThe proposed review of the EU securitisation framework aims to remove undue issuance and investment barriers in the EU securitisation market, specifically:\n\n\u00b7To reduce undue operational costs for issuers and investors, balancing with adequate standards of transparency, investor protection and supervision.\n\n\u00b7To adjust the prudential framework for banks and insurers, to better account for actual risks and remove undue prudential costs when issuing and investing in securitisations, while at the same time safeguarding financial stability.\n\nThe main financial stability safeguards in the framework (risk retention, ban on re-securitisation, robust credit granting standards) will not be affected by this reform. Moreover, the proposed changes are accompanied by changes to the supervisory framework that improve supervisory convergence and ensure that the supervisory framework is fit for a growing EU securitisation market.\n\nThe review of the EU securitisation framework aims to remove undue obstacles that hinder the growth and development of the EU securitisation market, but without introducing risks to financial stability, market integrity or investor protection. To achieve this, the proposed reforms are carefully targeted to address specific impediments to issuance and (non-bank) investment. The review envisages changes to four legal acts:\n\n\u00b7a legislative proposal amending the Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the \u2018Securitisation Regulation\u2019[7](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote8)), which sets out product rules and conduct rules for issuers and investors\n\n\u00b7a proposal amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the \u2018Capital Requirements Regulation\u2019 or \u2018CRR\u2019[8](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote9)), which sets out the capital requirements for banks holding and investing into securitisation, as well as\n\n\u00b7amendments to two delegated Regulations: the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 (the \u2018Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) Delegated Act\u2019[9](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote10)), governing the eligibility criteria for assets to be included in banks\u2019 liquidity buffer, and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 (the \u2018Solvency II (SII)Delegated Act\u2019[10](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote11)), governing the capital requirements for insurance and reinsurance undertakings.\n\nThe envisaged changes aim to make targeted improvements to the framework, rather than overhaul it. Those changes should be viewed as a package, as none of the individual components will achieve the desired outcome on its own. The elements of the package address both the supply and demand side of the market and reinforce each other to produce the desired impact. Streamlining reporting requirements and lowering capital requirements will both lower entry barriers and make it cheaper for banks to originate securitisations. Simplifying due diligence and amending the capital charges and liquidity treatment will make it easier and more attractive to invest in securitisation. A larger and more dynamic investor base will also incentivise more issuance. Relaunching the EU securitisation market is a complex issue that requires changes to be made in various parts of the framework to foster supply and demand in the securitisation market.\n\nRegulation alone can only go so far in terms of stimulating this market\u2019s development: market participants must also step in and do their part, e.g. by embracing standardisation and industry-wide initiatives towards specific segments \u2013 without market participant efforts, scaling up of the market will not be possible.\n\nVarious inputs have informed this review, including the [2020 EBA report on the significant risk transfer](https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/News%20and%20Press/Press%20Room/Press%20Releases/2020/EBA%20calls%20on%20the%20EU%20Commission%20to%20harmonise%20practices%20and%20processes%20for%20significant%20risk%20transfer%20assessments%20in%20securitisation/962027/EBA%20Report%20on%20SRT.pdf), the 2020 [ESRB report on Monitoring systemic risks in the EU securitisation market](https://www.esrb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/reports/esrb.report_securisation.20220701~27958382b5.en.pdf), the [2022 Commission Report on the Securitisation Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2022:517:FIN), the [2022 Joint Committee of the ESAs advice on the prudential framework](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/publications/joint-committee-advice-review-securitisation-prudential-framework_en), the [2024 targeted consultation on the functioning of the EU securitisation framework](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/regulation-and-supervision/consultations-0/targeted-consultation-functioning-eu-securitisation-framework-2024_en), and the 2025 Joint Committee Report on the implementation and functioning of the securitisation framework. The Commission also held various bilateral meetings with stakeholders and organised a workshop in July 2024 to discuss stakeholder views about the EU securitisation framework.\n\nIn terms of timing, the amendments to the Securitisation Regulation and the Capital Requirements Regulation are adopted by the Commission together. On the same date, the draft amendments to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio Delegated Regulation should be published on Have Your Say for a four-week consultation. The Commission plans to adopt draft amendments to the Solvency II Delegated Regulation in a broader package of amendments to that Regulation that is expected to be published for consultation in the second half of July of this year.\n\n\u2022Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area\n\nThe revision to the non-prudential provisions of the EU securitisation framework under the Securitisation Regulation are part of a broader legislative package that includes amendments to the Capital Requirements Regulation, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio Delegated Act and the Solvency II Delegated Act. The proposed changes have been drafted to ensure consistency across the various pieces of legislation and with the same general objective in mind.\n\nThe current proposal aligns the provision s on the delegation of due diligence tasks with those contained in Directive 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (the \u2018AIFMD\u2019)[11](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote12).\n\nIn addition to the legislative changes included in this package, the Commission is also considering amending the issuer limit in the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(the \u2018UCITS Directive\u2019)[12](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote13)in the context of the upcoming overall review of the UCITS Directive. The UCITS Directive imposes a limit on UCITS funds not to acquir e more than 10% of the debt securities of a single issuing body. In case of securitisation th at means that UCITS funds are only allowed to invest up to 10% in a single securitisation issuance since the securitisation vehicle itself is considered the issuer.\n\n\u2022C onsistency with other Union policies\n\nBy making the EU securitisation framework less burdensome and, more principles-based, the current proposal also contributes to the current Commission-wide effort to cut red tape and simplify the business environment as announced in the Commission 2025 work programme.\n\nThe review of the securitisation framework is also in line with the European Commission\u2019s broader strategy to rejuvenate the EU's economy, as outlined in the [Competitiveness Compass](https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/competitiveness-compass_en).By removing undue issuance and investment barriers in the EU securitisation market, the Commission aims to ensure that the EU economy can benefit from increased risk sharing opportunities and financing, thereby supporting economic growth and the EU\u2019s competitiveness.\n\nPart of the identified issuance and investment barriers stems from high operational costs linked to the regulation. Removing these costs is therefore also in line with the Commission\u2019s commun ication on a \"[Simpler and Faster Europe](https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/8556fc33-48a3-4a96-94e8-8ecacef1ea18_en?filename=250201_Simplification_Communication_en.pdf)\", which emphasizes reducing the regulatory burden on both households and businesses.\n\nFinally, the proposal is consistent with the Union's objective of safeguarding financial stability by ensuring that securitisation markets operate in a transparent, prudent, and resilient manner.\n\n2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\n\u2022Legal basis\n\nThe legal basis of the Regulation (EU) 2017/2402is Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the \u2018TFEU\u2019) which confers to the institutions of the European Union the competence to lay down appropriate provisions that have as their objective the establishment and functioning of the single market. The proposal introduces targeted amendments to Regulation (EU) 2017/2402and is therefore based on the same legal basis.\n\nIn particular, Article 114 TFEU confers the European Parliament and the Council with the competence to adopt measures for the approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States which have, as their object, the establishment and functioning of the internal market. Article 114 TFEU allows the Union to take measures not only to eliminate current obstacles to the exercise of the fundamental freedoms, but also to prevent, if they are sufficiently concretely foreseeable, the emergence of such obstacles, including those that make it difficult for economic operators, including investors, to take full advantage of the benefits of the internal market.\n\n\u2022Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)\n\nSecuritisation products are an important segment of Union financial markets, contributing to Union financial integration. Securitisation links financial institutions from different sectors of the financial markets and from different Member States and non-EU jurisdictions and can raise financial stability issues when not properly regulated. Therefore, securitisation requires regulation at Union level.\n\nThe purpose of the proposal is to make the EU securitisation framework less burdensome, and more principles-based. Achieving that objective will mean that financial institutions across the Union are better able to use securitisation as a tool to deepen EU capital markets, to diversify their risk profile and to free up banks\u2019 balance sheets for additional lending to EU households and businesses. Action at EU level also ensures a high level of financial stability across the EU. Overall, that aims to contribute to a more competitive and resilient EU economy.\n\nIn particular, the proposal examines certain provisions on due diligence, t ransparency and supervision[13](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote14). O nly action at EU level can ensure that going forward, th o se regulatory provisions are applied uniformly and guarantee the existence of the well-established regulatory framework regarding the taking up and the pursuit of securitisation and business across the Single Market.Th at is especially important as the majority of EU securitisation activity is concentrated in a handful of EU Member States. A Union-wide regulatory framework is fundamental to facilitat ing cross-border securitisations, and particularly to enable s uch activity in Member States where there is currently low uptake of securitisation s overa ll.The ability of Member States to adopt national measures is limited, given that the existing EU s ecuritisation f ramework already provides for a harmonised set of rules at EU level and that changes at national level would conflict with Union law currently in force.\n\n\u2022Proportionality\n\nThe policy choices within the proposal are considered proportionate as they target key areas such as streamlining transparency and due diligence rules without compromising financial stability or market integrity. The measures are calibrated to make the framework more proportionate than it currently is, and to set out a targeted and balanced approach foster issuance, investment, and market confidence. The proposal\u2019s proportionality is further substantiated by the Impact Assessment, which assesses the potential costs and benefits, ensuring the chosen measures are necessary and effective in meeting the overarching goals of the reform.\n\nAt the same time, the policy choices do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the stated objectives and refrain from a complete overhaul of the regulatory framework.\n\n\u2022Choice of the instrument\n\nThe proposal is an amendment to Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 and, therefore, it is a proposal for a Regulation. No alternative means \u2013 legislative or operational \u2013 can be used to attain the objectives of this proposal.\n\n3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS\n\n\u2022Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation\n\nAn evaluation of the securitisation framework was conducted covering the period from the date of into application of the securitisation framework (1 January 2019) until present. Its scope includes the legal framework in its entirety (Securitisation Regulation, relevant parts to the CRR, LCR Delegated Act and SII Delegated Act that pertain to securitisation transactions).\n\nIn line with the Better Regulation Toolbox, it examines whether the objectives of the securitisation framework were met during the period of its application (effectiveness) and continue to be appropriate (relevance) and whether the framework, taking account of the costs and benefits associated with applying it, was efficient in achieving its objectives (efficiency). The evaluation also considers whether the securitisation framework, as legislation at Union level, provided added value (EU added value) and whether it is consistent with other related pieces of legislation (coherence). The evaluation was conducted in parallel with the impact assessment accompanying the proposal revising the securitisation framework.\n\nThe evaluation concluded that the securitisation framework was partially successful in meeting its original objectives. It has supported the standardisation of processes and practices and partly tackled regulatory uncertainty. However, it has only been partly successful in removing the stigma associated with securitisation, and in removing regulatory disadvantages for simple and transparent securitisations, despite the regulatory improvements put in place. Moreover, the Framework has not been successful in reducing high operational costs and in significantly scaling up the securitisation market in the EU.\n\nAs a result, the evaluation concluded that more is needed to ensure that securitisation can meaningfully contribute to improve the financing of the EU economy and further develop the Savings and Investments Union. More specifically, the evaluation assessed that very prescriptive legal requirements in the area of transparency and due diligence result in high operational costs for issuers and investors in securitisations, and that a more principles-based approach might be more suitable. The prudential framework for banks and insurers is insufficiently risk sensitive and capital \u2018non-neutrality\u2019 is disproportionately high for certain securitisation transactions. Therefore, to address undue prudential barriers, a revision of the prudential treatment of securitisations is necessary.\n\n\u2022Stakeholder consultations\n\nOn 3 July 2024, the Commission hosted a Securitisation Workshop, which invited representatives from the banking industry/associations, Ministries, European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), the Single Supervisory Mechanism of the European Central Bank, the European Investment Bank, insurers, asset managers, nongovernmental organisations and pension funds to share their views.\n\nA targeted public consultation on the functioning of the EU securitisation framework was carried out between 9 October 2024 to 4 December 2024. 133 responses were received from a variety of stakeholders[14](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote15). The consultation was split into twelve sections which sought to gather views from a broad range of stakeholders active in the EU securitisation market on whether the s ecuritisation f ramework met and continues to meet its objectives in terms of market safety, operational cost reduction and prudential risk-sensitivity. The consultation was also used to collect feedback on the operation of the STS standard, the effectiveness of supervision, and the prospect of a future securitisation platform(s). In addition, the Commission has carried a series of bilateral meetings with a wide range of stakeholders who confirmed the feedback already received.\n\nThe feedback gathered in that consultation is reflected in the evaluation of the securitisation framework.\n\nA call for evidence was opened between 19 February 2025 and 26 March 2025[15](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote16) to request feedback from stakeholders on the review of the s ecuritisation f ramework. Stakeholders were asked to provide views on the Commission's understanding of the problem and possible solutions, and to provide relevant information. 34 respondents replied to the call for evidence and presented their views[16](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote17). Out of those 34 respondents, 26[17](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote18) had also replied to the 2024 targeted consultation, with their views remaining broadly the same. Points made by first-time respondents were also consistent with the feedback of the targeted consultation previously received.\n\n\u2022Collection and use of expertise\n\nThe preparation of this proposal has benefited from extensive expert input, including stakeholder consultations, meetings, and analytical work carried out by the ESAs. In particular, the ESAs delivered the 2021 and 2025 Art. 44 Joint Committee report s on the implementation and functioning of the Securitisation Regulation[18](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote19). Th o se reports focused on the implementation of the general requirements applicable to securitisations, including the risk retention, due-diligence and transparency requirements, and specific requirements related to STS securitisation, with respect to the Frameworks original objective of contributing to the sound revival of the EU securitisation framework.\n\nNational authorities were consulted in the framework of the Eurogroup Working Group+ , the Council Financial Services Committee , and the Commission Expert Group on Banking, Payments and Insurance. Several Member States also replied to the Targeted Consultation through their finance ministries and engaged with the Commission bilaterally.\n\n\u2022Impact assessment\n\nFor the preparation of this review an Impact Assessment was prepared and discussed with an Interservice Steering Group. The Impact Assessment report was submitted to the Regulatory Scrutiny Board on 12 March 2025. The board meeting took place on 9 April 2025. The Board gave a positive opinion and called for changes and additional input in the following areas: problem definition and substantiation; further detail on the assessed options and associated trade-offs; additional assessment on the combined impacts of options, particularly in relation to their relative risk levels and impact on financial stability. Those issues have been addressed and incorporated in the final version which is available on the Commission website and published together with this proposal.\n\nPolicy options for the entire package were identified in three key areas. Options to (i) reduce high operational costs, (ii) reduce undue prudential barriers for banks to issue and invest in securitisation, and (iii) remove undue prudential costs for insurers to invest in the EU securitisation market, were considered. That assessment resulted in a \u201cbundle\u201d of preferred options which, taken together, were deemed to best achieve the stated objectives.\n\nTo reduce high operational costs (estimated at 780 million per year for the market as a whole), both a targeted and broader set of measures were considered. Those options involve, to varying degrees, simplifying and removing certain due diligence and transparency requirements that are deemed duplicative or overly prescriptive (e.g., removing verification requirements for EU transactions and streamlining reporting templates). Our preferred option results in cost savings of 310 million per year. Similarly, targeted and more radical changes to the existing prudential framework for banks were assessed. Those focused on adjustments to the CRR and LCR, seeking to ensure greater risk-sensitivity for the capital treatment of securitisation for banks, to broaden the eligibility of securitisations for banks\u2019 liquidity buffers, and to make supervisors\u2019 assessment of transactions\u2019 eligibility for capital relief under the Significant Risk Transfer Framework faster and more coherent. A fundamental revision of the prudential framework for banks was another option considered. To remove disincentives for insurers to invest in the EU securitisation market, three options were assessed, entailing different degrees and modalities of reductions in the capital requirements for insurers investing in securitisations.\n\nBased on the comparative assessment in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and coherence, a preferred bundle of non-prudential and prudential measures was selected which were deemed the best avenue for the EU to take to reduce burden and compliance costs for issuers and investors, to revitalise the securitisation market and enhance the competitiveness of the EU financial system. Financial institutions across the EU will face a simpler and less costly transparency and due diligence regime and greater risk-sensitivity with regards to the actual risk of the securitisation investment.\n\nThe impact assessment of the various policy options primarily focused on their economic and regulatory impacts. The options can be considered to have only indirect impacts on social, environmental, and fundamental rights issues. Indirectly, the proposal would improve access to credit and financial services, particularly for corporates and SMEs, thereby promoting social inclusion, job creation, and economic growth. Though not the primary focus, the proposal may indirectly support environmental sustainability by facilitating green investments through improved capital access and alignment with existing green securitisation frameworks. There are no direct effects on fundamental rights, but the initiative supports financial stability and complies with data protection laws, thereby indirectly reinforcing economic rights and privacy safeguards.\n\n\u2022Regulatory fitness and simplification\n\nThe proposal simplifies and refines the existing legal provisions applying to securitisations, to enhance efficiency within the securitisation market. Therefore, it is of relevance to the Regulatory Fitness Programme (REFIT). The preferred option concerning the Securitisation Regulation entails a simplification of due diligence duties for businesses and a more efficient transparency framework. By reducing those obligations, businesses will face lower compliance costs, enabling more resources to be allocated to core business activities. While issuers may encounter some one-off adaptation costs, the recurrent reduction in administrative burdens should outweigh those initial expenditures. Through targeted adjustments and strategic simplification, those measures are positioned to bolster the market's capacity, attract a broader base of investors, and encourage economic growth\u2014while maintaining a resilient and transparent financial ecosystem.\n\nThe policy options taken in this proposal should have several positive effects on SME financing and competitiveness (see Annexes VII and VIII of the Impact Assessment report).\n\n\u2022Fundamental rights\n\nThe proposal is not likely to have a direct impact on the rights provided in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The simplification and efficiency measures do not directly address issues relating to personal data or privacy. Nonetheless, changes to disclosure and reporting standards must comply with existing data protection laws to ensure the security and privacy of any personal data involved in the securitisation process.\n\nThe proposal aims to reduce high operational costs and remove undue prudential barriers, while avoiding undue deterioration of protection and avoiding incentives for excessive risk-taking. It therefore represents a balancing of the need for economic stimulus with maintaining robust standards, thus minimising negative societal impacts. Overall, while the proposed measures mainly focus on financial regulation, there are potential indirect benefits that can arise, impacting social, environmental, and fundamental rights in supportive and sustainable ways. Ensuring a stable securitisation market contributes indirectly to the protection of fundamental economic rights by promoting financial stability through risk diversification.\n\n4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS\n\nThis legislative proposal would have limited consequences for the Union budget. It will imply further policy development within the Commission and in the three ESAs. Specific coordination tasks will be assigned to the European Banking Authority (EBA) in the context of the securitisation sub-committee reporting to the Joint Committee of the ESAs. The EBA\u2019s role will include providing the secretariat, permanent vice-chairpersonship to securitisation committee of the Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities referred to in Art. 36(3) (securitisation sub-committee) and leading the work of this sub-committee focusing, amongst other things, on supervisory issues, providing guidance to market participants, developing technical standards, and ensuring a consistent implementation of the regulatory framework in the Union. A financial fiche is provided as an annex hereto.\n\n5.OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n\u2022Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements\n\nSince the instrument proposed is a Regulation that is based to a significant extent on existing Union law, there is no need to prepare an implementation plan. The proposal is accompanied by a complete evaluation, as part of the impact assessment, which assesses, among other things, how effective and efficient it has been in terms of achieving its objectives. The proposal provides for a review report in Article 46 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402. The review will be accompanied by a legislative proposal, if appropriate. In that context, the reviewing and reporting requirements would be aligned, if needed.\n\nThe Commission shall carry out an evaluation of this package of proposed amendments, five years after its date of application and present a report on the main findings to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee.\n\n\u2022Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal\n\nInteraction and consistency between elements of the package\n\nThis proposal for a Regulation makes part of a wider securitisation review which encompasses changes to two Regulations (in addition to the Securitisation Regulation, the CRR) and two Delegated Acts (the LCR Delegated Act and the Solvency II Delegated Act). The proposed changes should be viewed as a package of measures that tackles in a comprehensive manner supply and demand issues in the securitisation market.\n\nSubject-matter and scope (Article 1)\n\nThe proposal clarifies that the servicer is an entity that manages a pool of purchased receivables or the underlying credit exposures on a day-to-day basis falls under the scope of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 (the \u2018Securitisation Regulation\u2019). The amendment is a clarification and it is not meant to enlarge the scope since a servicer is already subject to the Securitisation Regulation.\n\nDefinitions (Article 2)\n\nPublic and private securitisations are defined Article 2, points (32) and (33). Specifically, a \u201cpublic securitisation\u201d is established to be one if it meets any of the following conditions:\n\n(i) a prospectus has to be drawn up;\n\n(ii) notes constituting securitisation positions are admitted to trading in specific trading venues, ;\n\n(iii) the securitisation is marketed generally to investors and the specific terms are not negotiable among the parties, meaning that the transactions is offered to investors on take-it-or-leave-it basis.\n\nA private securitisation is one that does not meet any of the aforementioned criteria \u2013 it does not have a prospectus, it is not admitted to trading, and the terms and conditions are bilaterally negotiated between the originator and a small group of investors. Clarifying the definition of public and private securitisations is particularly relevant for the application of transparency requirements.\n\nDue diligence (Article 5)\n\nTo facilitate simpler and more streamlined investment in Union securitisations, some amendments are made to Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402. Verification requirements (Article 5(1) and Article 5(3), point (c)) are removed for investors whenever the sell-side party responsible for complying with the relevant sell-side provisions is established and supervised in the Union. In addition, the risk assessment in Article 5(3), point (a) and 5(3), point (b) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 is made more principled based by removing the detailed list of structural features that investors need to check and by clarifying in a recital that the due diligence assessment should be proportionate to the risk of the securitisation. The written procedures under Article 5(4) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 are also made more principled based by removing the detailed list of information in the second subparagraph of Article 5(4), point (a), of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402. Secondary market transactions are given an extra 15 days to document their due diligence. Finally, delegation of due diligence under Article 5(5) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 is aligned with other sectoral legislations where delegation of tasks does not transfer the legal responsibility.\n\nDue diligence requirements are waived where multilateral development banks fully guarantee the securitisation position, making it very low-risk. This means that investors can invest in such positions without doing extensive checks.\n\nLighter due diligence, specifically via waiving the verification and documentation requirements, is provided in case the securitisation includes a first loss tranche that is guaranteed or held by a narrowly defined list of public entities and where that tranche represents at least 15% of the nominal value of the securitised exposures.\n\nFor investments in positions issued by non-EU issuers, investors will continue to be required to verify that a given transaction complies with EU rules.\n\nRisk Retention (Article 6)\n\nRisk retention is waived in case the securitisation includes a first loss tranche that is guaranteed or held by a narrowly defined list of public entities and where that tranche represents at least 15% of the nominal value of the securitised exposures.\n\nTransparency (Article 7)\n\nTo lower the reporting burden on issuers, the reporting templates in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1224 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1225 should be reviewed. In particular, the number of required fields should be significantly reduced \u2013 by at least 35%, or more where feasible. To further reduce the compliance burden on the reporting entities, the review should consider distinguishing between mandatory and voluntary fields. In addition, the reporting templates should not require loan level information when the underlying exposures are highly-granular and short-term (such as credit card exposures or certain consumer loans). The review of the reporting templates, taking into account the aforementioned principles set in this proposal, should be carried out by the securitisation sub-committee of the ESAs Joint Committee, under the leadership of the EBA, in cooperation with the other ESAs.\n\nThe reporting template for private securitisations should be much lighter than the one for public securitisations and focused only on the needs of supervisors. To minimise the implementation costs for industry, this template should follow closely existing notification templates, in particular the guide on the notification of securitisation transactions by the Single Supervisory Mechanism. To ensure greater market transparency and facilitate the supervision and monitoring of the private market, this dedicated template for private securitisations should be reported to the securitisation repositories.\n\nSecuritisation Repository (Articles 10 and 17)\n\nAmendments to Article 10 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 rectify a wrong reference to Article 5 of that Regulation, which should be replaced with a reference to Article 7. Proposed amendments to Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 are introduced in light of the amendments in Article 7 that will extend the report to repository also for private securitisation. In light of those changes, a differentiation in the immediate and free of charge access to the repository has been proposed. Such access should be granted to the ESAs, the European Systemic Risk Board, the competent and resolution authorities and, upon request, the European Commission. In light of the different nature of public securitisation, access is granted also to investors and potential investors in such securitisations. Restricting the access of investors and potential investors to private securitisations is meant to protect the confidentiality of information in those securitisations.\n\nSTS requirements (Articles 20, 26b, 26c, 26e)\n\nTo facilitate the securitisation of SME loans in STS securitisation, the homogeneity requirement in Articles 20(8), (15) and Article 26b(8) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402, is to be amended to stipulate that a securitisation where at least 70% of the underlying pool of exposures consist of SME loans are deemed to comply with that requirement. The 70% threshold is lower than the current 100% requirement.\n\nTo enable insurance and reinsurance undertakings to participate meaningfully in the STS on-balance-sheet market, the eligibility criteria for credit protections in Article 26e(8) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 are amended to include also an unfunded guarantee by an insurance or reinsurance undertaking that meets certain robustness, solvency and diversification criteria.\n\nA number of other technical, but not substantive, amendments facilitate the implementation of the STS criteria.\n\nThird Party Verifiers (Article 28)\n\nThe proposal stipulates that Third Party Verifiers of STS compliance need to be supervised in addition to authorised by their respective national competent authority.\n\nSupervision (Articles 29, 30, 32 and 36)\n\nTo promote supervisory convergence and prevent fragmentation and differential regulatory interpretations, the proposal strengthens the role of of the securitisation sub-committee of the ESAs Joint Committee. In particular, the securitisation sub-committee is mandated to adopt guidelines to establish common supervisory procedures and to develop the reporting templates referred to in Article 7. To ensure greater accountability and continuity, the EBA is put in the lead of the work of the securitisation sub-committee of the ESAs Joint Committee, will provide the secretariat and a vice-chairperson for it, supporting the chairperson in the exercise of his or her tasks and performing the tasks of the chairperson during the latter\u2019s absence, on a permanent basis.\n\nTo ensure efficient and consistent supervision of the STS criteria, Article 29 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 should entrust banking national competent authorities with the responsibility to supervise the application of the STS criteria by bank-originated securitisations. For credit institutions in the Banking Union, that supervision would be carried out by the Single Supervisory Mechanism.\n\nTo enable supervisors to enforce the due diligence requirements, Article 32 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 is amended to explicitly include in the list of situations where NCAs may apply administrative sanctions the failure of institutional investors to meet due diligence requirements in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402.\n\nReports and Review (Articles 44 and 46)\n\nThe rolling mandate in Article 44 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 for the ESAs to report on the implementation of this Regulation is updated to require also an assessment of the contribution of securitisation to funding EU companies and economy.\n\nThe Commission is mandated to review the functioning of this amending Regulation by five years after its date ofapplication. If found appropriate, the review will be accompanied by a legislative proposal.\n\n2025/0826 (COD)\n\nProposal for a\n\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\n\namending Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2017 laying down a general framework for securitisation and creating a specific framework for simple, transparent and standardised securitisation\n\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission,\n\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank,\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee,\n\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,\n\nWhereas:\n\n(1)Securitisation can boost investment by allowing banks to transfer risks to those that are able to bear them and thereby free up their capital, which they could use for additional lending to households and businesses, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 of the European Parliament and of the Council[19](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote20), covering both simple, transparent and standardised (STS) and non-STS securitisations, has strengthened market transparency, safety, and standardisation. At the same time, that Regulation should be further simplified to more fully exploit the benefits that securitisation s can offer.\n\n(2)It is important that financial institutions employ their capital where it is most needed to reach the Union\u2019s economic goals and funding the real economy. In addition to the flexibility provided for by the existing rules, targeted changes to Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 would ensure that the Union securitisation framework better supports investments in the economy and facilitates lending to businesses.\n\n(3)To enhance transparency and to ensure consistent regulatory treatment aiming at reducing costs for issuers, a definition of public and of private securitisation should be introduced. The scope of public securitisations should cover transactions where the underlying notes are admitted to trading on regulated markets, Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs), Organised Trading Facilities (OTFs), or any other trading venue in the Union, and transactions marketed to investors under non-changeable terms and conditions where the package is offered on a \u201dtake-it-or-leave-it\u201d basis and investors have no direct contact with the originators or sponsor and can therefore not directly receive necessary information to conduct due diligence without the originator or sponsor disclosing any commercially sensitive information to the market. Defining those types of transactions as public, by virtue of their accessibility to a broad range of investors, should ensure that such transactions are subject to the appropriate transparency requirements and regulatory scrutiny and contribute to better market oversight and functioning.\n\n(4)Due diligence requirements should be proportionate to the risk profile of securitisation positions. Investor due diligence should therefore be focused on the risks characteristics and structural features that can materially affect the performance of the securitisation, avoiding duplicative, overly burdensome or generic obligations that may not be meaningful across different types of securitisation. For the same reason, due diligence obligations should be streamlined, thus reducing unnecessary costs for investors\u2014particularly in lower-risk securitisations\u2014and fostering more proportionate and risk-sensitive investor behaviour in the securitisation market.\n\n(5)Originators, original lenders, sponsors or securitisation special purpose entities (SSPEs) (the \u2018sell-side entities\u2019) that are established in the Union are already subject to supervision in the Union and can be sanctioned in case they breach their obligations under Regulation (EU) 2017/2402. It is therefore appropriate that investors are no longer required to verify whether Union sell-side entities, where those entities are responsible on behalf of the sell-side parties in the transaction, comply with due diligence requirements set in Regulation (EU) 2017/2402. Investors should, however, still verify whether have complied with their obligations for which third countries\u2019 sell-side entities are responsible under Regulation (EU) 2017/2402.\n\n(6)Senior tranches, typically benefiting from substantial credit enhancement and posing lower risk, should require a less extensive due diligence review than junior or mezzanine tranches, which bear higher risk and greater exposure to losses. That proportional approach supports more efficient allocation of resources by investors and avoids excessive burdens for low-risk investments.\n\n(7)Since compliance with the STS requirements is already subject to separate regulatory oversight and notification, the obligation for investors to verify compliance with those requirements is redundant. Moreover, verifying compliance with the STS criteria is not relevant for all types of investors. The corresponding requirement should therefore be deleted.\n\n(8)Investors should be allowed to conduct simplified due diligence to investments in repeat transactions where key risk characteristics are already well understood. For those purposes, investment in repeat transactions should be considered as investment in securitisation positions issued by the same originator, backed by the same type of underlying assets, exhibiting the same structural features, and offering the same or lower level of credit risk compared to previous investments. That change should ensure consistency in due diligence practices while facilitating investor participation in well-known and transparent structures.\n\n(9)Multilateral development banks can play a significant role in facilitating investor access to securitisation markets, enhancing liquidity, and supporting the objectives of the Savings and Investments Union. Where a securitisation position is fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by a multilateral development bank listed in Article 117(2) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[20](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote21), the credit risk arising from the securitisation position is effectively transferred from the pool of underlying assets to the guarantor, resulting in a 0% risk weight of such exposure. In addition, such securitisation position is categorised as Level 1 asset under Article 10(1), point (g), of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61[21](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote22). In such cases, it is appropriate to exempt institutional investors, except the entity providing the guarantee, from their due diligence requirements in full under Regulation (EU) 2017/2402.\n\n(10)Transactions where the first loss tranche is either held or guaranteed by the Union, national promotional banks or institutions within the meaning of point (3) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2015/1017 of the European Parliament and of the Council[22](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote23) inherently possess characteristics that mitigate the need to carry out the full due diligence and fulfil the risk retention requirement. These transactions carry an assurance by the guarantor, who carries out due diligence processes before affording such a guarantee. This assessment removes the need for the institutional investors to perform a full due diligence assessment under Regulation (EU) 2017/2402. Furthermore, the essence of a guarantee is the assumption of risk by the guarantor. Therefore, it is appropriate to lift the risk retention requirement. These changes are expected to crowd in private investment in derisked structures with a public guarantee.\n\n(11)An institutional investor that delegates the authority to make investment management decisions to another institutional investor should be able to instruct the delegate to perform the due diligence obligations set out in Regulation (EU) 2017/2402. However, such delegation should not transfer legal responsibility. The delegating institutional investor should remain ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with the due diligence requirements. That specification is intended to reflect established regulatory practice and to ensure that obligations are fulfilled effectively while maintaining clear lines of accountability.\n\n(12)The disclosure requirements should consider the granularity of the underlying pool of exposures, i.e. how many loans are in the underlying pool. In addition, it is important to consider the average maturity of the underlying exposures. Loan level disclosure for highly-granular pools of very short-term exposures can be particularly costly and entails a considerable burden for issuers, often without offering significant benefits in terms of additional information to investors. Therefore, disclosure requirements for securitisations of credit card exposures and certain types of consumer loans should not need to encompass reporting at the level of each individual underlying exposure. However, competent authorities should still have the possibility to ask for additional information to ensure that they have a complete overview of the market, including on the exposures that constitute the underlying pool, in carrying out their duties under Regulation (EU) 2017/2402.\n\n(13)The current reporting templates[23](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote24) both for public and private securitisations are too costly and burdensome. The burden on entities when complying with their reporting obligations should be therefore reduced, without undermining the goal of providing transparency to the market. The reporting templates should be streamlined to reduce the number of mandatory data fields. The revision of the template should aim to bring a reduction of at least 35% of mandatory data fields. The conversion of certain mandatory fields into voluntary fields could add further flexibility, but appropriate attention should be given to ensure that that does not compromise data quality or usability.\n\n(14)The reporting framework should account for the specific characteristics of private securitisation s. A dedicated and simplified reporting template for private securitisations should be developed. In specifying the details of reporting requirements, the information required to be reported should be aligned as closely as possible with other well-established templates, in particular with the guide on the notification of securitisation transactions developed by the European Central Bank in accordance with Article 6(5), point (a), of Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013[24](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote25). Any future changes to the European Central Bank guide should be assessed and the reporting templates may need to be reviewed, where appropriate. To allow for basic visibility for supervisors over the private market, private securitisations should report to repositories. Private securitisations should not need to report the same amount of information as public securitisations. Requiring private transactions to report to securitisation repositories, using a simplified template, would improve supervisory oversight and market monitoring. However, to maintain the confidentiality of private transactions, data from those transactions should not be publicly disclosed.\n\n(15)The securitisation sub-committee of the Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities (the \u201cJoint Committee Securitisation Committee - JCSC\u201d), referred to in Article 36(3) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402, under the leadership of the European Banking Authority (EBA), should develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the information that the originator, sponsor and SSPE are to provide to comply with the reporting obligation. Those draft regulatory technical standards should take into account the usefulness of the information for the holder of the securitisation position, whether the securitisation is public or private, whether the securitisation position is of a short-term nature and, in the case of an asset-backed commercial paper programme (ABCP) transaction, whether it is fully supported by a sponsor. The Commission should be empowered to supplement Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 by adopting those regulatory technical standards by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council[25](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote26), Regulation (EU) No 109 4/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Counci l[26](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote27) and Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Counci l[27](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote28). Moreover, the JCSC, under the leadership of the EBA, should de velop draft implementing technical standards to specify the format for the provision of the information to repositories. The Commission should be empowered to adopt those implementing technical standards by means of an implementing act pursuant to Article 291 TFEU and in accordance with Regulation s (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010.\n\n(16)To support access to market-based financing for SMEs, and to facilitate the development of cross-border securitisations involving exposures from multiple Member States, the criteria for the homogeneity of asset pools should be revised. While it is possible to have securitisations involving exposures from multiple Member States, the requirement o f homogeneity, as defined at present, is considered as an obstacle for SMEs securitisations. To overcome that obstacle, a pool of underlying exposures should be deemed homogeneous where at least 70% of the exposures at origination consists of exposures to SMEs. That lower threshold recognises the specific financing needs and characteristics of SMEs and ensures that mixed pools with a predominant SME component can benefit from the legal certainty and operational efficiencies associated with homogeneous pools. The remaining portion of the pool should be allowed to include other types of exposures, also from different Member States, without affecting the securitisation\u2019s status as STS.\n\n(17)In 2021, Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 was amended by Regulation (EU) 2021/557 of the European Parliament and of the Council[28](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote29) to extend the STS framework to synthetic securitisations. As indicated in the report of the Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities, that extension of the STS label has led to satisfactory results in terms of opening the way for new issuance and encouraging greater activity in this market segment. However, the practical implementation of the STS requirements has revealed the necessity to further improve the clarity and consistency in specific requirements with some technical adjustments.\n\n(18)To ensure the consistent selection of the underlying exposures in a securitisation and to enable investors to assess the credit risk of the asset pool prior to investment, active portfolio management on a discretionary basis of a securitisation exposure is prohibited. Article 26b of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 contains an exhaustive list of permitted management activities and stipulates that certain activities should not be considered active portfolio management on a discretionary basis and therefore not be prohibited. It is necessary to update that list to include removals due to sanctions imposed on an entity during the life of the transaction or fraudulent practices, or amendments to the loan due to a change in the law affecting the enforceability, which are outside the control of the originator. Both circumstances would have an impact on the enforceability of the underlying exposures (beyond the control of the originator) and the removal of those underlying exposures should not be considered as active portfolio management on a discretionary basis.\n\n(19)The criteria relating to standardisation laid down in Article 26c of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 outline the mechanisms for loss allocation to securitisation position holders and determine the application of various amortisation methods to tranches. The central aim of those criteria is to ensure that non-sequential amortisation is employed only when accompanied by distinctly specified contractual triggers. Those triggers are intended to prompt a switch to sequential payments based on the hierarchy of seniority, thereby protecting the transaction from the premature amortisation of credit enhancement in the event of a decline in credit quality. Such premature amortisation could expose originators holding those tranches to risks associated with a diminishing credit enhancement cushion. However, those criteria fail to adequately consider the loss-bearing capacity of tranches subordinated to the protected tranches within a securitisation, leading to misapplication when interpreted literally in the context of synthetic securitisations that include mezzanine tranches. Those criteria inadvertently assume that all associated losses fall solely on the protected tranche, and thus ignoring an assignment to more junior tranches. It should therefore be specified that, in instances where junior tranches absorb portions of the underlying exposure losses, their loss-bearing capacities should be taken into consideration for the application of the criteria.\n\n(20)Article 26e(3) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 currently specifies that the credit protection premiums to be paid under the credit protection agreement are to be structured as contingent on the outstanding nominal amount of the performing securitised exposures at the time of the payment and reflect the risk of the protected tranche. To ensure the effectiveness of the credit protection agreement from the originators\u2019 perspective and at the same time provide legal certainty for investors on the termination date to make payments by specifying the maximum extension period for the debt workout, it should be specified that only credit protection premiums contingent on the size of the outstanding tranche and credit risk of the protected tranche are allowed.\n\n(21)Article 26e(7) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 specifies the conditions under which an originator may commit synthetic excess spread as credit enhancement for investors. One of those conditions is that, for originators not using the IRB Approach referred to in Article 143 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the calculation of the one-year expected loss of the underlying portfolio is to be clearly determined in the transaction documentation. In order to specify the requirements for the synthetic excess spread committed by the originator and available as credit enhancement for the investors, a specific criterion has been introduced in the 2021 amendment to Regulation (EU) 2017/2402. The application of this criterion has shown that it requires further clarification. In addition, an inconsistency has been identified regarding the requirements for originators not using the IRB Approach. That requirement should be amended to align with the intent to set a cap, equivalent to one year's expected loss, on the total amount of synthetic excess spread that the originator should commit per year, thereby ensuring consistency and clarity in the application of that provision.\n\n(22)The current criterion requiring credit protection is to be funded in the STS framework for on-balance-sheet synthetic securitisation under the STS regime has limited the ability of insurance or reinsurance companies to participate in the on-balance-sheet STS securitisation market. That is detrimental to the development of the STS market and the ability of originators to transfer credit risk outside the banking system. Allowing unfunded credit protection to be eligible for the STS label should, however, not undermine the quality of the STS label or the reliability of the credit protection agreement, nor should it create incentives for inexperienced or undiversified insurance or reinsurance undertakings to become exposed to high levels of risk. It is therefore appropriate to put in place safeguards to ensure that participation is limited to insurers with a certain level of robustness and diversification. Therefore, eligibility for providing unfunded credit protection under the STS label should be accompanied by requirements related to diversification, solvency, risk measurement, and minimum size of the protection provider. Specifically, when it comes to risk measurement, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking should use an approved internal model to calculate capital requirements for such credit protection agreements. When it comes to solvency, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking should comply with the Solvency Capital Requirement and Minimum Capital Requirement referred to in Articles 100 and 128 of Directive 2009/138/EC, respectively, and should have been assigned to credit quality step 3 or better. When it comes to diversification, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking should effectively operate business activities in at least two classes of non-life insurance, which should reduce overexposure to any single risk type. Finally, when it comes to minimum size, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking should have total assets above EUR 20 billion.\n\n(23)Third-party verifiers have a role in assessing the compliance of securitisations to the STS criteria. Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 only requires third-party verifiers to be authorised by national competent authorities. Such authorisation is, however, of limited assurance if competent authorities are not in position to assess whether those third-party verifiers continue to comply with the conditions for their authorisation on an ongoing basis. It is therefore appropriate to lay down that competent authorities are also responsible for the ongoing supervision of such third-party verifiers and adequately empowered to do so.\n\n(24)To ensure the effective implementation and enforcement of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402, it is necessary to clarify the responsibilities of competent authorities in supervising the compliance of all relevant parties involved in a securitisation. Competent authorities should oversee the conduct of originators, sponsors, original lenders, and SSPEs. This includes verification of whether individual securitisation transactions comply with the applicable requirements under this Regulation.\n\n(25)In order to strengthen compliance with, and to enhance the effectiveness of, Regulation (EU) 2017/2402, the scope of sanctioning powers under Article 32 of that Regulation should be broadened to explicitly include infringements of due diligence obligations. Institutional investors play a key role in ensuring the soundness and transparency of the securitisation market by conducting appropriate due diligence before and during their exposures. To ensure consistent enforcement across the Union of those due diligence requirements, it should be specified that failure to comply with those requirements is to be subject to remedial measures and administrative sanctions by competent authorities.\n\n(26)Fostering supervisory convergence is essential to the proper functioning and further development of the securitisation market which brings together a wide range of economic actors often based in different jurisdictions, even for the same transaction. The involvement of several competent authorities, combined with the current complexity of th e decision-making process, highlights the need to strengthen the supervisory coordination.Simplifying and reinforcing existing frameworks for supervisory coordination, where feasible,should support the broader aim of simplification in regulation and supervision. Stronger convergence can be achieved by using more efficiently and effectively existing powers that allocated to the ESAs and the competent authorities.This outcome should be also supported by giving a more prominent role to the EBA, which should assume permanent stewardship of supervision coordination issues for the securitisation market in the Union.\n\n(27)The Joint Committee Securitisation Committee,composed of market and prudential competent authorities, should focus on issues stemming from supervision and should facilitate and promote supervisory convergence through common supervisory practices. The current mandate of the JCSC should be reviewed to put emphasis on supervisory convergence and work related to Article 44 of this Regulation. The JCSC can meet in different format s or establish subgroups for specific tasks according to the issues to be discussed. The EBA should provide the secretariat and a vice-chair person for the Joint Committee Securitisation Committee on a permanent basis, deputising and supporting the chairperson in the exercise of his or her duties.In the absence of the chairperson, the vice-chairperson should perform the tasks of the chairperson, including in situations where no chairperson is elected. Representatives to this body from participating market and prudential competent authorities should have the appropriate level of knowledge and experience in matters under discussion. The regular monitoring of the state of the market and evaluation of the supervisory securitisation framework in the Union through monitoring reports, development of guidelines and regular peer reviews would further strengthen the supervisory framework promoting best (supervisory) practices.\n\n(28)Given that securitisation activity in the Union is primarily concentrated in the banking sector, it is appropriate that the EBA assumes the permanent stewardship role in the Joint Committee Securitisation Committee. In the exercise of its permanent role in the Joint Committee Securitisation Committee, the EBA should attach particular attention to nourishing strong and collaborative working relationships with the European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA)and duly taking account of their sectoral perspectives. It should be expected that such reinforced supervisory coordination will result in more robust and consistent supervision of the securitisat i on market in the Union. In this capacity, the EBA should also lead the work on the develop ment of the disclosure template s as provided for in Article 7 of this Regulation.This will be instrumental in preparing the market for the anticipated growth and developing supervisory capacity and preparedness to support this expansion. Assigning a stewardship role to EBA in this supervisory capacity aligns with the strategic vision of an efficient and simplified regulatory landscape.\n\n(29)In case of cross-border securitisations, appointing a lead supervisor would streamline the supervision of compliance with Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 and ensure consistency and better coordination among the different competent authorities. The lead supervisor should be appointed from among the competent authorities of the entities involved in the transaction, with the decision taken by the competent authorities concerned. In case of disagreements the matter should be dealt with at the level of the Joint Committee Securitisation Committee. Whenever a new transaction involves entities supervised by the same competent authorities, the lead previously appointed can keep that role.\n\n(30)It is important to ensure that the regulatory framework for securitisations remains effective and adapts to the evolving financial landscape. For that reason, the Commission should comprehensively review the impact and functionality of this Regulation within 5 years after its adoption, with careful attention to its influence on the securitisation market and its broader economic implications. That review should focus on critical aspects, including market dynamics, the accessibility of credit in particular for SMEs, investments, and the interconnectedness of financial institutions which is vital for maintaining the stability of the financial sector. Combining insights from the reports referred to in Article 44 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 and further analyses, the Commission should determine the necessity for legislative updates to safeguard the role of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 in supporting a resilient and dynamic economy within the European Union.\n\n(31)Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States given that securitisation markets operate globally and that a level playing field in the internal market for all institutional investors and entities involved in securitisation should be ensured but, by reason of their scale and effects, can be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n\n(32)Regulation (EU)2017/2402 should therefore be amended accordingly,\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\nArticle 1\n\nAmendment to Regulation (EU) No 2017/2402\n\nRegulation (EU) 2017/2402 is amended as follows:\n\n(1)in Article 1, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n\n\u2018This Regulation applies to institutional investors and to originators, sponsors, original lenders, servicers and securitisation special purpose entities.\u2019;\n\n(2)in Article 2, the following points (32) and (33) are added:\n\n\u2018(32)\u2018public securitisation\u2019 means a securitisation that meets any of the following criteria:\n\n(a)a prospectus has to be drawn up for that securitisation pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation (EU)2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council[29](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote30);\n\n(b)the securitisation is marketed with notes constituting securitisation positions admitted to trading on a Union trading venue as defined in Article 4(1), point (24) of Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council[30](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote31);\n\n(c)the securitisation is marketed to investors and the terms and conditions are not negotiable among the parties.\n\n(33)\u2018private securitisation\u2019 means a securitisation that does not meet any of the criteria laid down in point (32).\u2019\n\n(3)Article 5 is amended as follows:\n\n(a)paragraph 1 is amended as follows:\n\n(i)point (c) is deleted;\n\n(ii)points (e) and (f) are replaced by the following:\n\n\u2018(e)if established in a third country, the originator, sponsor or SSPE designated in accordance with Article 7(2) has made available the information required by Article 7(1) in accordance with the frequency and modalities provided for in that paragraph;\n\n(f)if established in a third country, in the case of non-performing exposures, the originator, sponsor or original lender has applied sound standards in the selection and pricing of the exposures.\u2019;\n\n(b)paragraph 3 is amended as follows:\n\n(i)point (b) is replaced by the following:\n\n\u2018(b)all the structural features of the securitisation that can materially impact the performance of the securitisation position;\u2019;\n\n(ii)point (c) is deleted;\n\n(c)paragraph 4 is amended as follows:\n\n(i)in point (a), the second subparagraph is deleted;\n\n(ii)the following point (g) is added:\n\n\u2018(g)in the case of secondary market investments, document the due diligence assessment and verifications within a reasonable period of time which in any case shall not exceed 15 calendar days after the investment.\u2019;\n\n(d)the following paragraph s 4a and 4b are inserted:\n\n\u2018(4a)Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not apply to institutional investors that hold a securitisation position where such securitisation position is guaranteed by a multilateral development bank listed in Article 117(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\n\nFor the purposes of the first subparagraph, the guarantee shall meet the conditions of Article 213 and 215 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\n\n(4b)Paragraphs 1 and 4 shall not apply to institutional investors that hold a securitisation position where the first loss tranche representing at least 15% of the nominal value of the securitised exposures is either held or guaranteed by the Union or by national promotional banks or institutions within the meaning of point (3) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2015/1017 of the European Parliament and of the Council.\u2019;\n\n(e)paragraph 5 is replaced by the following:\n\n\u2018(5) Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 to 4 of this Article, where an institutional investor has given another institutional investor authority to make investment management decisions that might expose it to a securitisation, the delegating institutional investor may instruct the delegated institutional investor to fulfil its obligations under this Article in respect of any exposure to a securitisation arising from those decisions.

This proposal aims to:\n\n(1) to revive a securitisation market that will improve financing of the EU economy and\n\n(2) to strike a better balance between safety and market development.\n\nThe aim is to create conditions and environment for greater lending to the real economy. A well-functioning securitisation market will incentivise banks to be more active in the market ultimately also making them lend more to the economy.\n\n1.3.2.Specific objective(s)\n\nThis proposal has the following objectives:\n\n(1) Reduction of high operational costs for issuers and investors balancing with robust and proportionate standards of transparency, investor protection and supervision;.\n\n(2) Removal of regulatory barriers, allowing the market to develop in a more sustainable and resilient way;\n\n(3) Contribute to the Commission's effort to reduce the regulatory burden on market participants.\n\nSecuritisation can be an important channel for diversifying funding sources and allocating risk more efficiently within the EU financial system. It would allow for a broader distribution of financial sector risk and can help to free up banks' balance sheets to allow for further lending to the different categories of economic agent (e.g. non-financial companies, SME, individuals). Overall, it can improve efficiencies in the financial system and provide additional investment opportunities. Securitisation can bridge banks and capital markets with an indirect benefit for businesses and citizens (through, for example, less expensive loans, mortgages and credit cards).\n\n1.3.3.Expected result(s) and impact\n\nSpecify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries / groups targeted.\n\nSuggested changes will revitalise securitisation market and allow securitisation to play a role in the development of the Savings and Investments Union and to reduce burden and compliance costs for issuers and investors. By addressing the high operational costs that have deterred banks and insurers from participating in the EU securitisation market, proposed changes will contribute to the Commission's effort to reduce the regulatory burden on market participants and stimulate market development the use of securitisation. At the same time, the proposed changes will continue to safeguard financial stability and provide an adequate level of investor and consumer protection.\n\n1.3.4.Indicators of performance\n\nSpecify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.\n\nThe following indicators will be used to monitor progress and achievements:\n\nMonitoring the cost of conducting due diligence to invest in securitisation transactions.\n\nMonitoring issuance cost stemming from the reporting requirements.\n\nTracking the number of securitisation issuers and investors.\n\n1.4.The proposal/initiative relates to:\n\n\uf0a8a new action\n\n\uf0a8a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action[33](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote34)\n\n\uf078the extension of an existing action\n\n\uf0a8a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action\n\n1.5.Grounds for the proposal/initiative\n\n1.5.1.Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative\n\nThe proposal presents a series of simplifications and refinements to enhance efficiency within the securitisation market. Through targeted adjustments and simplification, these measures are positioned to bolster the market's capacity, attract a broader base of investors, and encourage economic growth\u2014while maintaining a resilient and transparent financial ecosystem. The changes are expected to boost the competitiveness and sustainability of the EU Securitisation Framework, driving growth for all stakeholders involved.\n\nA significant simplification of due diligence duties for businesses and a more efficient transparency framework would involve a streamlining of the processes companies need to follow to ensure compliance. By reducing these obligations, businesses will face lower compliance costs, enabling more resources to be allocated to core business activities.\n\n1.5.2.Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, great er effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.\n\nReasons for action at EU level (ex-ante):\n\nSecuritisation products are part of EU capital markets which are open and integrated. Securitisation links financial institutions from different Member States and non-Member States: often banks originate the loans that are securitised, while financial institutions such as insurers and investment funds invest in these products and they do so across European borders.\n\nSecuritisation is a tool to deepen EU capital markets, to diversify their risk profile and to free up banks\u2019 balance sheet for additional lending, for EU households and businesses, to make the EU economy more competitive and resilient.\n\nThe ability of Member States to adopt national measures is limited, given that the existing EU securitisation framework, already provides for a harmonised set of rules at EU level and that changes at national level would conflict with Union law currently in force. Individual Member State action cannot by itself attain the objectives outlined above.\n\nExpected generated EU added value (ex-post):\n\nThe proposal aims to aims to remove undue issuance and investment barriers in the EU securitisation market and will deliver a level playing field in the internal market for all institutional investors and entities involved in securitisation.\n\n1.5.3.Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past\n\nThe evaluation and impact assessment accompanying the legislative proposal have assessed how the existing framework has performed and identify a few shortcomings. The general objective \u201cto revive a safer securitisation market that will improve the financing of the EU economy, weakening the link between banks\u2019 deleveraging needs and credit tightening in the short run, and creating a more balanced and stable funding structure of the EU economy in the long run\u201d has been only partially achieved because, while the securitisation market is safer, the initiative has not been sufficient to revive the market or improve financing opportunities. Most of the measures that were introduced in the framework aimed first and foremost to mitigate potential risks associated with securitisation, rather than support market development. Going forward, the objective is to strike a better balance between safety and market development. For this reason, most of the proposed changes focus on developing further the EU securitisation market by making the framework more proportionate.\n\n1.5.4.Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments\n\nThe objectives of the initiative are consistent with a number of other EU policies and ongoing initiatives, in particular with the Union policies aimed at creating Savings and Investments Union. In its March 2025 Communication on Savings and Investments Union, the European Commission announced adoption of measures focusing on simplifying due diligence and transparency to further boost securitisation market.\n\nThe legislative proposal would remain compatible with the MFF with limited budgetary impacts as it foresees additional Union contribution to European Banking Authority (EBA) stemming from the additional 2 FTEs that the EBA would receive to implement additional tasks conferred by the legislators.\n\nSynergies and room for redeployment were examined, resulting in one FTE who would be transferred from ESMA to the EBA to reflect the transfer of a task between the authorities. The FTE transferred from ESMA would have no significant budgetary impacts except for a transfer within Heading 1.\n\nAltogether, the proposal will increase of 3 more FTEs the authorised staff of the EBA during the future annual budgetary procedure, including 1 FTE transferred from ESMA. The EBA will continue to work towards maximising synergies and efficiency gains (inter alia via IT systems), and closely monitor the additional workload associated with this proposal, which would be reflected in the level of authorised staff requested by the agency in the annual budgetary procedure.\n\n1.5.5.Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment\n\nDifferent financing options were discussed, including in particular covering the costs by fees and internal redeployment. The fee option is practically unworkable as fees levied on firms would not be able to cover the costs of the proposals. Such an approach would also be difficult to justify, as the considered measures are not directly linked to supervisory powers, but part of developing the regulatory framework.\n\nPotential for redeployment was examined, resulting in the transfer of 1 temporary agent from ESMA to the EBA. Further internal redeployment within the ESAs is not an option, given that ESAs already struggle significantly to deliver on their regulatory tasks.\n\n1.6.Duration of the proposal/initiative and of its financial impact\n\n\uf0a8limited duration\n\n\u2013\uf0a8in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY\n\n\u2013\uf0a8financial impact from YYYY to YYYY for commitment appropriations and from YYYY to YYYY for payment appropriations.\n\n\uf078unlimited duration\n\n\u2013Implementation with a start-up period from 2027 to 2029,\n\n\u2013followed by full-scale operation.\n\n1.7.Method(s) of budget implementation planned[34](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025PC0826#footnote35)\n\n\uf0a8Direct management by the Commission\n\n\u2013\uf0a8 by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations;\n\n\u2013\uf0a8by the executive agencies\n\n\uf0a8Shared management with the Member States\n\n\uf078Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:\n\n\u2013\uf0a8 third countries or the bodies they have designated\n\n\u2013\uf0a8 international organisations and their agencies (to be specified)\n\n\u2013\uf0a8 the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund\n\n\u2013\uf078 bodies referred to in Articles 70 and 71 of the Financial Regulation\n\n\u2013\uf0a8 public law bodies\n\n\u2013\uf0a8 bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they are provided with adequate financial guarantees\n\n\u2013\uf0a8 bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that are provided with adequate financial guarantees\n\n\u2013\uf0a8 bodies or persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the common foreign and security policy pursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union, and identified in the relevant basic act\n\n\u2013\uf0a8\uf0a0bodies established in a Member State, governed by the private law of a Member State or Union law and eligible to be entrusted, in accordance with sector-specific rules, with the implementation of Union funds or budgetary guarantees, to the extent that such bodies are controlled by public law bodies or by bodies governed by private law with a public service mission, and are provided with adequate financial guarantees in the form of joint and several liability by the controlling bodies or equivalent financial guarantees and which may be, for each action, limited to the maximum amount of the Union support.\n\nComments\n\nN/A\n\n2.MANAGEMENT MEASURES\n\n2.1.Monitoring and reporting rules\n\nIn line with standard arrangements practiced in existing agencies, the European Banking Authority (EBA) will prepare regular reports on its activity (including internal reporting to Senior Management, reporting to Boards and the production of the annual report), and will be subject to audits by the Court of Auditors and the Commission's Internal Audit Service on its use of resources and performance.\n\nThe EBA Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 is subject to regular reviews.\n\n2.2.Management and control system(s)\n\n2.2.1.Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed\n\nThe European Supervisory Agencies for financial services (EBA, EIOPA, ESMA), are decentralised regulatory agencies pursuant to Art. 70 Financial Regulation.\n\nManagement and control systems of the European Banking Authority are provided for in Chapter VI of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 establishing it, in combination with the applicable framework financial Regulation (EU) 2019/715 as endorsed by the Authority.\n\nThe Authority must ensure that the appropriate standards are met in all areas of the internal control framework and is subject to audits by the Commission\u2019s Internal Audit Service. In addition, every financial year, the European Parliament, following a recommendation from the Council, grants discharge to this agency for the implementation of its budget.\n\n2.2.2.Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them\n\nIn relation to the legal, economic, efficient and effective use of appropriations resulting from the actions to be carried out in the context of this proposal by the EBA, this initiative does not bring about new significant risks that would not be covered by an existing internal control framework.\n\n2.2.3.Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)\n\nManagement and control systems are provided in the Regulation (EU) 1093/2010 which governs the functioning of the EBA. These are deemed to be cost effective. The initiative will have no significant effect on costs to be supported by those of the Member States or the EBA from that angle. Impacts on risks of error rates are expected to be very low.\n\nHistorically DG FISMA\u2019s costs of the overall supervision of an Authority such as the EBA have been estimated at 0.5% of the annual contributions paid to it. Such costs include, for example but not exclusively, the costs related to the assessment of the annual programming and budget, the participation of DG FISMA's representatives in Management Boards, Boards of Supervisors and related preparatory work.\n\n2.3.Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities\n\nFor the purposes of combating fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity, the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) applies to EBA without any restrictions.\n\n3.ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE\n\n3.1.Heading(s) of the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected\n\n\u00b7Existing

1. INTRODUCTION[1](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025SC0750#footnote2)

1.1. Context

Following the second intergovernmental conference of 15 October 2024, which opened accession negotiations on cluster 1 – fundamentals, four intergovernmental conferences were convened leading to the opening of negotiations on four clusters. Albania continued to implement the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, and the joint bodies under the agreement met.

The firm political commitment of the Albanian authorities to the strategic goal of EU integration has been consistently stated as the country’s key priority, and a high level of ambition to move forward in the accession negotiations has been generally maintained. The ongoing momentum in the accession negotiation process needs to lead to faster EU-related reforms. Albania maintained its record of full alignment with the EU’s common foreign and security policy, aligning with the EU position, including on restrictive measures and sanctions against Russia. Albania’s stance sends a strong signal of its strategic choice of EU accession and of its role as a reliable partner.

Albania has actively engaged and started delivering on the implementation of the new Growth Plan for the Western Balkans across the four pillars: (i) gradual integration with the EU single market; (ii) regional economic integration; (iii) fundamental reforms; and (iv) increased financial support. Under the Reform and Growth Facility (RGF), a performance-based EU instrument supporting the EU accession process, the country adopted its reform agenda, which covers reforms in the areas of: (i) business environment; (ii) human capital; (iii) digitalisation; (iv) energy and green transition; and (v) fundamental rights and the rule of law. After initial delays in setting up internal coordination structures, Albania appointed a RGF national coordinator and continued to work towards the reform agenda targets.

The Commission’s 2025 rule of law report[2](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025SC0750#footnote3) covered Albania for the second time.

1.2. Main findings of the report

Cluster 1: The fundamentals of the accession process

Democracy

The overall framework allows for generally free and fair elections.The parliamentary elections held on 11 May 2025, which followed a partial electoral reform, resulted in a fourth consecutive term for the ruling party. The preliminary conclusions of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) / Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) election observation mission noted that elections were competitive and professionally conducted, but identified some shortcomings, including the lack of a level playing field and abuse of public resources. The partial electoral reform amended the Electoral Code but failed to address a number of longstanding recommendations from the OSCE/ODIHR and the Venice Commission. A comprehensive electoral reform is needed.

Parliament can exercise its powers in a partially effective way. Political polarisation, lack of genuine political dialogue and clashes between the ruling majority and parts of the opposition continued to affect Parliament’s activity, while public consultation processes remained limited. Parliament is also hampered by l imited oversight over the executive, while the politicisation of parliamentary appointments to top positions in constitutional bodies or independent institutions established by law remains a serious issue. Concerns were noted regarding the work, methodology and impact of the ad hoc parliamentary committee on deepening reforms for good governance, rule of law and anti-corruption.Following the 11 May elections, the number of standing committees increased from eight to eleven, of which four are chaired by opposition.

The government continued to show its commitment to EU integration. Following the 11 May parliamentary elections, a new government took office in September 2025. The division of responsibilities between local and central government remains an issue

Albania’s bodies in charge of the EU integration process are in place. They successfully coordinated national positions, leading to the opening of negotiations on five of the six clusters during the reporting period. EU integration expertise, planning and interinstitutional mechanisms will need to be further strengthened to sustain Albania’s ambition to speed up the reforms required by the EU accession process. The EU integration process needs to be more inclusive, cross-party, and supported by effective consultation mechanisms. Communication efforts on EU integration should intensify.

Civil society organisations (CSOs) operate in a partly enabling environment. They face challenges regarding registration requirements and limited public funding, along with an increase in negative narratives and online smear campaigns.

Public administration reform

Albania remains moderately prepared in the area of public administration reform (PAR). It made some progress during the reporting period, resulting in the adoption of the new Intersectoral Strategy Against Corruption (ISAC) 2024–2030 and Medium-Term Revenue Strategy 2024–2027 in December 2024, and of the Cross-Cutting Strategy on Public Administration Reform 2025-2030 in July 2025. Amendments to the laws on civil service and on the organisation of state administration remain to be adopted, with the latter submitted for public consultation. The practice of budget revisions carried out through normative acts adopted by the executive continues. Clear political steer for the PAR agenda from the Minister of State for Public Administration and Anti-Corruption continued.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®start implementing the new public administration strategy and review the effectiveness of the current monitoring structures;limit the use of normative acts for budget revisions and pursue a return to regular budget revision processes;

®adopt and implement a new legislative framework for the civil service, which includes revised rules on merit-based recruitment, promotion and dismissal in the civil service law at all levels, especially senior level, and begin automating the payroll system again;

®adopt and implement revised legislation properly regulating the typology and criteria to set up subordinated institutions and clarifying lines of accountability.

Chapter 23: Judiciary and fundamental rights

Albania is moderately prepared in the area of judiciary and fundamental rights and has made some progress during the reporting period.

Functioning of the judiciary

Albania is between having a moderate and a good level of preparation and has made some progress on the functioning of the judiciary. Albania continued implementing the justice reform. The vetting process for all judges and prosecutors was finalised in first instance, further strengthening judicial independence and accountability. Vetting procedures on appeal have increased in pace and are now on track to meet the constitutional deadline of June 2026. The High Judicial Council (HJC) has adopted by-laws enhancing its procedures and standards applicable to its members and to judges. The High Prosecutorial Council (HPC) has also enhanced standards applicable to magistrates. The HJC has proceeded with new appointments of magistrates, contributing to a reduction of vacancies at first instance level. Challenges in the appointments of non-magistrate members of the HJC and HPC, and in conducting timely and qualitative evaluations, appointments, promotions, and transfers of magistrates remained. While the resilience of the judiciary has improved overall, increased attempts by public officials or politicians to exert undue interference and pressure on the judicial system remained an issue of serious concern. A new Cross-Sector Justice Strategy for 2024-2030 was adopted. Sufficient budget was allocated to develop a modern, integrated, electronic case management system, but full establishment is currently foreseen only for 2030. Pressing issues on judicial efficiency, quality and integrity still need to be addressed, in line with the best European standards and practices.

Sustained reform efforts are needed to continue to strengthen the judicial system and maintain high standards of integrity after the completion of the vetting process. The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and therefore remain largely valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®further strengthen accountability by: (i) finalising the vetting process; (ii) e nhancing asset and background assessment standards, ensuring high-quality and speeding-up evaluation reports for all magistrates; (iii) aligning rules applicable to all non-magistrates of the HJC and HPC with those applicable to magistrates, as regards asset declaration and background checks; (iv) filling the magistrate-inspector vacancies at the High Justice Inspectorate, and (v) reducing political interference on the judiciary and prosecution services;

®improve the quality of justice by: (i) filling vacancies for court chairs, magistrates, legal advisers and court staff at all levels of the judiciary and increasing the total number of magistrates and legal advis e rs at all levels, towards the EU average; (ii) comprehensively revising the School of Magistrates’ entrance exam and initial and continuous training curricula; and(iii) increasing the quality and integrity of the School of Magistrates’ staff;

®improve judicial efficiency by: (i) adopting comprehensive legal and regulatory measures to increase efficiency at all levels, and to further reduce backlog, in line with the Roadmap for Judicial Efficiency, the principles of justice reform and European standards; (ii) finalising the procurement for and first piloting of the integrated case management system modules and (iii) expanding the online notification system for access to court files and processes to all courts of general jurisdiction.

Fight against corruption

Albania is moderately prepared and has shown some progress. The Anti-Corruption Strategy for 2024-2030 has been adopted. The Specialised Structure Against Organised Crime and Corruption (SPAK) further consolidated its positive results in fighting high-level corruption and made tangible progress towards a solid track record in the fight against corruption. However, corruption remained widespread across vulnerable sectors, affecting both the public and private spheres. The institutional framework for prevention of corruption continued to have a limited impact and coordination with law enforcement remained weak. Shortcomings regarding transparency and effectiveness of asset declaration checks still need to be addressed.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and therefore remain largely valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®continue to strengthen the investigation, prosecution and adjudication of corruption cases and secure more final convictions, in particular at high-level, including the seizure and final confiscation of criminal assets resulting from corruption-related offences, and increase proactive referrals by relevant state institutions and law enforcement agencies to SPAK;

®complete and simplify legislation on preventing corruption in line with European standards, and address the remaining recommendations of the Council of Europe’s Group of States against Corruption (GRECO);conduct in-depth risk assessments in vulnerable sectors, implement effectively integrity plans at corruption-prone institutions, such as the State Cadastre Agency, and increase the capacity of the General Directorate on Anti-Corruption (GDAC);

®make asset declaration checks by the High Inspectorate of Declaration and Audit of Assets and Conflicts of Interest (HIDAACI) more effective and transparent by updating procedures and ensuring sufficient resources, addressing undeclared or concealed assets and by ensuring that asset declarations of politically exposed persons are publicly available online.

Fundamental rights

Albania’s legal framework sets out a generally good basis for the protection of fundamental rights. Significant achievement was made during the reporting period with the adoption of a new Law on personal data protection and seven of its ten accompanying pieces of implementing legislation, in full alignment with the EU acquis, as well as the adoption of implementing legislation on the rights to persons belonging to national minorities, in the core areas of self-identification and the use of minority languages, consistent with European standards. The enjoyment of media freedom and pluralism, of the right to property and of the rights of persons belonging to minorities remain problematic. Implementation efforts need to intensify overall.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were only partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®ensure effective implementation of the legal framework on the rights of persons belonging to minorities and increase the capacity and resources of the State Committee on National Minorities and of local authorities;

®expand the enjoyment of the right to property and legal certainty by: (i) making progress on first registrations; (ii) digitising ownership titles, documents, and maps; (iii) improving the quality and accuracy of cadastral data; (iv) enhancing integrity, transparency, and effectiveness in delivering public services at the State Cadastre Agency; and (v) advancing on compensations and guaranteeing the right to a fair trial in cases of expropriation and removal of properties;

®further align with and implement the EU acquis on equality and non-discrimination including as regards sexual orientatio n and gender expression, ensur e that the upcoming Law on g ender e quality maintains a high level of ambition in line with EU standards, and demonstrate good implementation capacity of the new Law on personal data protection, implement effectively the National Agenda on Child Rights and complete the deinstitutionalisation of children.

Freedom of expression

Albania is between having some and a moderate level of preparation in the area of freedom of expression and made limited progress during the reporting period. The situation remains largely unchanged, with media independence and pluralism continuing to be affected by the overlap of business and political interests, the lack of transparency of financing sources, the high concentration of media ownership, intimidation and precarious working conditions for journalists. The launch of a structured dialogue between Albanian institutions and media actors as well as the adoption of soft measures on journalise safety were positive developments. Concerns were raised, however, regarding the legality and due process observed during the eviction by the authorities of a media outlet from the public-owned offices it occupied.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were not implemented and remain valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®adopt a major reform of the legal and regulatory framework to: (i) strengthen transparency of media ownership, media plurality and editorial independence;(ii) strengthen transparency of media financing from private and state resources;(iii) strengthen the autonomy of the media regulator and the independence of the state broadcaster; (iv) fully repeal criminal provisions on insult and defamation; and (v) align civil aspects of defamation with European standards;

®ensure zero tolerance for intimidation and effective enforcement in cases of attacks against journalists, including judicial follow-up;ensure increased capacities of law enforcement bodies to handle cases of violence, including on the margins of protests, and other criminal cases involving journalists, notably by ensuring high human rights compliance in handling incidents involving journalists, through binding instructions, data collection and capacity building measures;

®improve Albanian journalists’ working conditions, in particular by strengthening the protection of journalists’ employment and social rights and ensuring that the L abour C ode is applied consistently.

Chapter 24: Justice, freedom and security

Albania is moderately prepared in aligning with the EU acquis in the area of justice, freedom and security and has made good progress in this area. The capacity and effectiveness of the Specialised Structure Against Organised Crime and Corruption (SPAK) to disrupt organised crime groups increased and the use of financial investigations improved. Although their full functionality still needs to be demonstrated, an asset recovery office and a national early warning system on the detection of new psychoactive substances were set up within the Albanian State Police. A national drugs observatory has been established within the Ministry of Health, though it is still to become operational. Albania continued to implement its migration strategy, which is aligned with EU priorities. Further efforts are needed to improve access to asylum and to align the country’s visa policy with the EU’s.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain valid to a significant extent. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®further develop the systematic use of financial investigations when dealing with serious and organised crime, including illicit trafficking, terrorism and money laundering;

®operationalise the national drugs observatory and increase the functioning and output of the national early warning system on the detection of new psychoactive substances, including by strengthening cooperation with the EU Drugs Agency;

®improve the asylum referral system and access to asylum procedures, continue to address the issue of unfounded asylum applications of Albanian nationals in Schengen and associated countries, ensure that legal pathways developed for third-country nationals in Albania prevent irregular secondary movements to the EU, and further align the country’s visa policy with the EU list of visa-required third countries.

Fight against serious and organised crime

Albania is moderately prepared in the fight against organised crime. Good progress was made in meeting last year’s recommendations by increasing SPAK’s capacity in financial investigations, strengthening the fight against money laundering and seizing assets linked to organised crime. SPAK has also further consolidated cooperation with its international counterparts, in particular with EU Member States and EU agencies, to investigate and crack down on high-risk criminal groups with initial tangible results. Albania needs to speed up work on aligning its legal framework on organised crime with the EU acquis, strengthen law enforcement capacity and improve the efficiency of investigations, including through the development of criminal and financial analysis capabilities.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain largely valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®c ontinue to strengthen its track record of investigations, prosecutions and final convictions in all fields of serious and organised crime, including drug trafficking, money laundering and terrorist financing through continued cooperation with EU Member States and EU agencies, and by increasing capacity to deter organised crime and ensuring further alignment with the EU acquis, notably on the criminalisation of money laundering and combating child sexual abuse and exploitation online and offline;

®improve the efficiency of the asset recovery system, by strengthening the functioning of the asset recovery office responsible for identif ying and tracing criminal assets within the Albanian s tate p olice, notably its operational cooperation with asset recovery offices in EU Member States, by improving the implementation of instruments to confiscate proceeds of crime and property derived from criminal activities, and by better managing frozen and confiscated property also for social reuse;

®improve criminal and financial analysis capacity, including through reinforced inter-agency cooperation and methodologies to tackle complex criminal cases.

Economic criteria

The existence of a functioning market economy

Albania has a good level of preparation in developing a functioning market economy and made some progress in this area. The economy maintained a strong growth momentum in 2024 thanks to robust domestic demand and tourism. Inflation fell below the central bank’s target while fiscal consolidation accelerated, and the public debt ratio continued to decline. Despite increases, government revenue as a share of GDP remains low, while spending on public investment is repeatedly under-executed. The labour market situation improved, but structural problems persist. The banking sector remained stable, well capitalised and liquid, while lending to the private sector increased. The business environment remains affected by a weak rule of law, limited access to finance, and shortcomings in the oversight and governance of state-owned enterprises.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partly addressed and remain largely valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®implement the Medium-Term Revenue Strategy and prepare proposals to reduce tax expenditure, prioritising the elimination of exemptions lacking sound policy justification;

®increase the transparency and accountability of state-owned enterprises, including by publishing their annual financial performance reports;

®enhance the operationalisation of the public investment management framework, including the National Single Project Pipeline, and ensure that the projects entering the Medium-Term Budget Programme are mature and of good quality, in order to avoid the under-execution of public investments.

The capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the EU

Albania has some level of preparation to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the EU and made limited progress in this area. The education system still faces numerous challenges, skills gaps persist, and the youth not in education, employment or training (NEET) rate remains a concern. Transport and digital infrastructure improved, but infrastructure gaps remain. Albania remains competitive as a tourism destination, offering an expanding scope of services, but industry and agriculture remain low-productivity sectors that have been contracting. Manufacturing exports fell due to weak demand, exchange rate appreciation, and businesses’ low pricing power.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®continue to improve and better promote the vocational education and training (VET) system in order to increase the number of graduates from VET schools and ensure that labour skills align with job market demands;

®improve the quality and inclusiveness of the education system and advance its digital transformation;

®strengthen infrastructure, including building cyber-resilience.

Chapter 5: Public procurement

Albania is moderately prepared in public procurement. Limited progress was made in the alignment of the legal framework for public procurement.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should, in particular:

®continue efforts to improve competitive procurement procedures;

®further align the legislative framework with the EU acquis in the area of concessions and public-private partnerships, and start work on further alignment with the EU acquis in the field of defence and security procurement;

®ensure compliance with the EU acquis and the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) on intergovernmental agreements concluded with third countries in the area of public procurement.

Chapter 18: Statistics

Albania is moderately prepared in the area of statistics. Some progress was made in improving the compilation of macroeconomic statistics in line with the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010), the publication of the detailed data of the 2023 population and housing census, and by continuing to improve data transmission to Eurostat.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain largely valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®continue increasing the production and dissemination of timely and high-quality data and make government finance statistics (GFS) data publicly available;

®p repare the 2026 a gricultural census in line with the relevant EU acquis;

®ensure adequate staffing at the Institute for Statistics (INSTAT).

Chapter 32: Financial control

Albania is moderately prepared in the area of financial control and partially aligned with the EU acquis. Despite the adoption of the anti-fraud strategy, limited progress was made in this chapter during the reporting period.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®focus on delegating more financial and management responsibilities to improv e managerial accountability;

®build on the initial work of the parliamentary subcommittee on audit, with a particular focus on ensuring oversight o f the executive’s implementation of audit recommendations;

®strengthen controls and consolidate capacities to protect EU financial interests, ensure appropriate reporting of irregularities, and i mplement the anti-fraud strategy.

Cluster 2: Internal market

Chapter 1: Free movement of goods

Albania is between having some and a moderate level of preparation in the area of free movement of goods. No progress on alignment with the EU acquis was achieved in the reporting period.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were not implemented and remain valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®complete the alignment of its legislation with the relevant EU acquis on quality infrastructure, i.e. on accreditation, conformity assessment and market surveillance;

®significantly strengthen the enforcement capacity of the market surveillance inspectorate;

®finalise and adopt an a ction p lan to comply with Articles 34-36 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), fully covering the non-harmonised area, with a timeframe for screening all legislation and practices, and introducing mutual recognition clauses or repealing and/or amending legislation and practices as necessary.

Chapter 2: Freedom of movement for workers

Albania is between having some and a moderate level of preparation in the freedom of movement for workers. Some progress was achieved by concluding bilateral social security agreements with EU Member States and further advancing the preparations to connect Albania’s employment services system to the European network of employment services (EURES).

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®continue developing the employment services IT system to enable its connection to EURES upon accession;

®strengthen the enforcement of the Law on foreigners as per the National Migration Strategy 2024-2026;

®continue negotiating and concluding new bilateral agreements on social security, notably with EU Member States, and develop IT infrastructure fo r European Health Insurance Card(EHIC) and Electronic Exchange of Social Security Information(EESSI) purposes, as well as administrative capacities for joining the EESSI network.

Chapter 3: Right of establishment and freedom to provide services

Albania is moderately prepared in the right of establishment and freedom to provide services. No progress was achieved in the reporting period.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were not implemented and remain valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®start amending the legislation to address the barriers to the freedom of establishment and free movement of services identified in the 2023 self-screening exercise;

®continue efforts to align its legislation with the EU acquis and ensure appropriate institutional capacity in the area of mutual recognition of professional qualifications.

Chapter 4: Free movement of capital

Albania is between a moderate and good level of preparation in the area of free movement of capital. Some progress was made towards closer alignment with the EU acquis on payments, which enabled Albania to join the geographical scope of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) schemes in November 2024, which became effective in October 2025. Albania has continued its action against money laundering, in particular with the adoption of the National Strategy on the Fight Against Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing 2024-2030.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®ensure equal treatment of EU citizens and Albanian citizens on the acquisition of land, in line with Albania’s obligation under the S AA;

®take action to ensure that the provisions of the EU acquis on the cross-border regulation, the SEPA regulation, the Instant Payment Regulation and interchange fees are implemented;

®c ontinue to implement the 2024-2030 A nti-M oney L aundering and T errorism F inancing S trategy and National Risk Assessment A ction Plan 2024-2027.

Chapter 6: Company law

Albania is moderately prepared in the field of company law. Limited progress was made in the reporting period through the adoption of the Law on auditing and accounting, aimed to further align with the EU acquis.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®make progress in aligning with the EU acquis, including by introducing amendments on the use of digital tools, cross-border conversions, mergers and divisions, and on encouraging long-term shareholder engagement;

®continue to implement the amended Law on auditing and continue efforts to further align the legal framework for accounting and audit with the latest EU acquis in these areas.

Chapter 7: Intellectual property law

Albania is moderately prepared in the area of intellectual property rights (IPR). Some progress was made with the adoption of the new laws on trademarks and patents. The new draft law on copyright was prepared and submitted for consultation and approval.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®ensure alignment with the relevant EU a c qu i s on IPR, and start to implement the new laws on copyright, trademarks and patents;

®continue to improve the functioning of CMOs, especially in terms of enforcement and collection of royalties and payments to rights holders;

®strengthen the enforcement of all aspects of the IPR system through monitoring, budgeting, increased awareness, strengthened institutional capacity and training.

Chapter 8: Competition policy

Albania is between having some and a moderate level of preparation in competition policy. There was limited progress during the reporting period, including on legislative alignment with the EU acquis in the area of case referrals in relation to concentrations.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were implemented only to a limited extent and remain valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®ensure the operational independence of the S tate Appeal Commission (S AC) and significantly increase the administrative capacity of the SAC’s secretariat;

®further align the legislative framework in the area of State aid with the EU acquis;

®step up efforts to raise awareness among the judiciary, line ministries and regional and local authorities of competition law and State aid rules, to ensure that the SAC is notified in advance of aid measures and to strengthen the enforcement of competition rules and State aid rules.

Chapter 9: Financial services

Albania is between a moderate and a good level of preparation in the area of financial services. Some progress was made in further aligning the country’s legislation with the EU acquis on private pension funds.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®continue work ing towards full y align ing Albania’s banking regulation with the amended versions of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD)/Regulation (CRR), the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), and the D eposit G uarantee S chemes Directive (DGS) and the EU acquis on capital markets, including securities markets, investment funds and financial market infrastructures;

®complete alignment with the EU acquis on insurance, including the Solvency II Directive;

®ensure that the Albanian National Development Bank is well regulated and supervised, including its deposit-taking activities.

Chapter 28: Consumer and health protection

Preparations are at an early stage in the area of consumer and health protection. There was no progress on alignment with the EU acquis in this area.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were not implemented and remain valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®make progress on align ing consumer law with the latest EU acquis to address developments in this area;

®complete alignment with the EU acquis on medic inal products for human and veterinary use, medical devices and on tobacco control;

®increase the financial and human resources in the health sector, specifically in primary healthcare and all-hazard health emergency preparedness, and guarantee equal access to quality health services for vulnerable populations, in particular women and girls who belong to these groups.

Cluster 3: Competitiveness and inclusive growth

Chapter 10: Digital transformation and media

Albania is between a moderate and a good level of preparation in the field of digital transformation and media and made limited progress during the reporting period. The current Law on cybersecurity enabled further alignment with the EU Directive on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union (NIS 2 Directive). In June 2025, Albania adopted an updated list of Critical and Important Information Infrastructure Operators. The new Cybersecurity Strategy 2025-2030 and its Action Plan for 2025-2027 have been adopted.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain largely valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular

®adopt the decision to extend the roll-out of the 112 emergency number to the whole country;

®finalise the implementing legislation for the Law on electronic communications and the Law on cybersecurity;

®improve access to the use of e-services, build this capacity and step up the collection of statistical data on digital performance and digital competitiveness as per the Digital Economy and Society Index.

Chapter 16: Taxation

Albania is moderately prepared in the area of taxation. Some progress was made in the reporting period, mainly through the adoption of the Medium-Term Revenue Strategy and the report on evaluation of tax exemptions, paving the way for improved tax policy measures and reform in the next years.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®r educe the number of tax exemptions in line with the adopted Medium-Term Revenue Strategy, and pursue the gradual alignment of VAT and excise duties legislation with the EU acquis;

®simplify the taxation system to further encourage tax compliance, and further improve the use of third-party data in the fight against tax fraud and evasion;

®continue preparations towards achieving interconnection and interoperability with the common EU taxation IT systems.

Chapter 17: Economic and monetary policy

Albania is between a moderate and a good level of preparation in the area of economic and monetary policy and made some progress as the Bank of Albania maintained price stability. Albania continued its fiscal consolidation and complied with the fiscal rule.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should, in particular:

®fully align the Law on the Bank of Albania with the EU acquis;

®a dopt the law to establish an independent fiscal institution;

®align Albania’s budget legislation and practices with the requirements of the EU acquis.

Chapter 19: Social policy and employment

Albania is moderately prepared in the area of social policy and employment and made limited progress during the reporting period. No measures are in place to set up and implement an indexation mechanism for the benefits of economic aid. More work is needed on advancing legislative alignment with the EU Labour Law and occupational health and safety acquis, and with EU acquis in the area of non-discrimination and equality, including gender equality.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should:

®set up the Interministerial Council of Occupational Health and Safety and its secretariat, including drafting the respective set s of rules/procedures and building the capacity of its members, increase and strengthen cross-sectoral coordination, and boost municipal capacity and staffing;

®roll out the Youth Guarantee and its Implementation Plan to more regions, taking the lessons learned from its pilot phase into account;

®further increase budget allocation, social services provision and monitoring of the Social Fund, strengthen the capacity of local governments to secure sufficient funding, and develop a coordinated social service referral system, c onsistently implemented at local level.

Chapter 20: Enterprise and industrial policy

Albania is between a moderate and a good level of preparation in the area of enterprise and industrial policy and made some progress, in particular through revising the Business and Investment Development Strategy (BIDS).

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should, in particular:

®accelerate addressing the main challenges to the business environment while improving the predictability of regulatory measures and improve the implementation of the BIDS, notably by ascertaining the needed funding of foreseen actions;

®speed up the full alignment with the EU acquis on late payments Directive;

®draft and adopt a unified investment law that would address current challenges faced by investors, and secure legally sound property titles.

Chapter 25: Science and research

Albania is between having some and a moderate level of preparation in the area of science and research. Some progress was made with the approval of the Smart Specialisation Strategy and the adoption of the Law on science and scientific research, which is aligned with the relevant EU acquis, as well as the first successful call managed by the Albanian Start-Up Agency. Albania still needs to adopt the required implementing legislation to ensure effective implementation of the 2023-2030 National Strategy on Scientific Research, Technology and Innovation.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®increase investment in research, in line with its own commitments and the new European Research Area priorities, with a view to reach ing 1% of GDP by 2030;

®implement the S mart S pecialisation S trategy and A ction P lan;

®produce reliable statistics and data on innovation, science and technology with a view to improv ing Albania’s classification in the European innovation scoreboard.

Chapter 26: Education and culture

Albania is between a moderate and good level of preparation in the field of education and culture. Some progress was made with the implementation of the National Strategy for Education 2021-2026 and the adoption of legislative acts to reform higher education. Albania still needs to strengthen the quality and inclusiveness of education. The implementing legislation of the Law on cultural heritage and museums has yet to be finalised.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®further optimise the VET system in line with labour market needs;

®further improve the professional development and training of teachers and trainers, with a focus on (i) pedagogical skills to implement the competence-based inclusive approach and (ii) digitalisation from pre-primary to university levels, including VET education;

®adopt the implementing legislation for the Law on cultural heritage and museums.

Chapter 29: Customs union

Albania is between a moderate and a good level of preparation in the area of the Customs Union. Some progress was made with the amendments to the legal provisions for the customs code, the development of the new computerised transit system (NCTS) and digitalisation of more customs services.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®adopt and implement the legal provisions on the common transit procedure at national level and finalise the develop ment of the national component of the NCTS, as well as continue preparations for achieving the interconnection and interoperability of its national customs IT systems with the EU electronic customs environment;

®continue the fight against the smuggling of illicit goods, including tobacco products, corruption and imports of counterfeit products,including by strengthening administrative capacity and improving cooperation between the authorities involved, as well as with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF);

®complete the legal adjustments necessary to keep up with developments of the EU customs acquis, in particular the acts implementing the Union Customs Code as well as other EU legislation enforced by customs

l

Cluster 4: The green agenda and sustainable connectivity

Chapter 14: Transport policy

Albania has some level of preparation in the area of transport policy, with limited progress achieved in the reporting period. Albania adopted legislation to separate its railway company into distinct entities and set up a road traffic monitoring centre with intelligent transport systems (ITS).

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®adopt the new National Transport Strategy, and its accompanying Action Plan, and the new Road Safety Strategy in line with the EU acquis and the Transport Community Road Safety Action Plan;

®finalise the reform of the Albanian Road Authority to enable the smooth progression of Service Level Agreement;

®implement legislation on the railway sector reform, in line with the Transport Community R ail A ction P lan.

Chapter 15: Energy

Albania has a good level of preparation in the area of energy. It made good progress, in particular on the internal electricity energy market.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain largely valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®accelerate the adoption of the update d 2021-2030 N ational E nergy and Climate P lan (NECP) in line with the 2030 Energy Community targets and recommendations;

®strengthen the capacity of the Energy Efficiency Agency, continue drafting and adopting implementing legislation (including setting up the energy efficiency obligation scheme), in line with its obligations under the Energy Efficiency Directive,and adopt the implementing regulations on labelling;

®continue implementing the Electricity Integration Package and, in particular, join the EU Day-ahead market coupling by June 2026.

Chapter 21: Trans-European networks

Albania has some level of preparation in trans-European networks. Some progress was made in developing transport and energy networks, and work to prepare projects is still ongoing.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®speed up the implementation of the TEN-T (trans-European transport networks) five-year rolling workplan of the Transport Community Treaty and continue developing the core energy networks in line with the national strategies and infrastructure investment prioritisation, under the single project pipeline;

®continue to align its legal framework with the EU acquis and the regulations on TEN-T and TEN-E (trans-European energy networks), including fully aligning with guidelines on trans-European energy infrastructure, and strengthen administrative capacity;

®accelerate the preparatory work and initiate investments to complete the projects on the Western Balkans – Eastern Mediterranean European Transport Corridor.

Chapter 27: Environment and climate change

Albania has some level of preparation in this area, and it made noprogress over the reporting period. The country needs to adopt its draft laws on integrated waste management and on extended producer responsibility. In March 2025, the new ‘mountain package’ law was adopted, with the stated intention of promoting investment projects in forests and pastures through fiscal incentives and land acquisition facilities for investors. This could have significant implications for local land use and environmental management. No major developments were reported on water quality, where the relevant implementing legislation is still under preparation, nor on air quality or civil protection. No particular development was reported on addressing climate change. Albania should adopt the updated National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) 2021-2030, since the consultation phase has been completed. Further efforts are still needed on implementation and enforcement of the environment and climate acquis. The Law on water resources and the Law on the marine environment protection strategy entered into force in October 2024. The creation of a portfolio of minister for the environment in the new government is a welcome development.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were therefore implemented to a limited extent and remain valid. In the coming year, Albania should, in particular:

®achieve full alignment, implementation and enforcement of the Directives on E nvironmental I mpact A ssessment (EIA) and S trategic E nvironmental A ssessment (SEA) and ensure that all infrastructure investments comply with the EU environment and climate acquis and national and international nature and water obligations, and ensure public participation;

®take immediate measures to fight environmental crime and achieve full alignment with the Environmental Crime Directive and the Environmental Liability Directive, and strengthen policy implementation and law enforcement for nature and biodiversity protection, especially in protected areas;

®update and implement the National Adaptation Plan, accelerate the adoption of the updated 2021-2030 NECP, align with the M onitoring, R eporting, V erification and A ccreditation (MRVA) acquis for the purpose of introduc ing carbon pricing and aligning with the EU E mission T rading S ystem (ETS).

Cluster 5: Resources, agriculture and cohesion

Chapter 11: Agriculture and rural development

Albania has some level of preparation in agriculture and rural development. There was limited progress in building administrative capacity and on legislative alignment.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®ensure that the preconditions for the entrustment of budget implementation tasks under the Instrument for pre-accession assistance for rural development (IPARD) III programme are met in line with the principles of sound financial management;

®ensure th at there is th e administrative capacity and technical support needed to set up the farm sustainability data network (FSDN);

®complete legislative alignment with the EU acquis,in particular on quality policy.

Chapter 12: Food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy

Albania has some level of preparation in the area of food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy. Limited progress was made over the reporting period. The Animal Health and Plant Health laws were adopted. However, further efforts are still needed to align the legislation under this chapter with the EU acquis and enforce it. Albania should implement the adopted national food safety sectoral policy.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®work on alignment of national legislation with the EU food acquis in general and, specifically, on adopting the laws on official controls and animal welfare and the General Food Law Regulation, and prepare a national plan for the upgrade of establishments producing food, feed and animal byproducts to meet EU structural standards;

®ensure th at Albania’s competent authorities have the a ppropriate resources needed to properly implement and enforce the laws, including resources for official controls, and ensure sufficient laboratory capacities as well as a clear separation between risk management and risk assessment within the National Food Authority;

®strengthen its capacity to design and implement effective surveillance, monitoring and vaccination programmes for the main infectious animal diseases, including rabies.

Chapter 13: Fisheries and aquaculture

Albania is moderately prepared in fisheries and aquaculture. It made some progress in particular by continuing to operate the vessel monitoring system (VMS) effectively. As a contracting party of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), Albania continues to actively implement the recommendations for monitoring its fishing activities.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®strengthen the administrative capacity needed for inspection and control capacities, and for data collection and scientific advice, in line with the EU’s common fisheries policy and the GFCM and other international agreements;

®implement the regional action plan for small-scale fisheries;

®adopt measures to support the fishery sector under State aid.

Chapter 22: Regional policy and coordination of structural instruments

Albania is moderately prepared in the area of regional policy and coordination of structural instruments. Some progress was made during the reporting period, notably by moving towards fulfilment of enabling conditions, introducing legislative changes and building administrative capacity.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and therefore remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®prepare for the effective implementation of the EU acquis under Chapter 22 and strengthen preparations and capacities for the future cohesion policy in terms of programming, implementation, monitoring, evaluation, communication, financial management, control and audit, enabling conditions and the partnership principle; as well as guarantee mechanisms to ensure co-financing of multi-annual programmes in view of the preparation and execution of project pipelines for future cohesion policy, including those related to sustainable urban development;

®strengthen administrative capacity for programmes under indirect management by beneficiary country and territorial cooperation programmes with Member States and neighbouring non-Member States, prepare the roadmap for administrative capacity building at central, regional and local level in the cohesion policy ecosystem, and adopt a comprehensive retention policy and ensure stability and continuity of the structures, in particular senior management, in preparation for the future cohesion policy;

®ensure coordination between competent authorities to strengthen the protection of the EU’s financial interests through coordinated implementation of national legislation, policies and action plans to manage irregularities, including the fight against corruption and fraud, prevent ing and manag ing conflicts of interest, and protecti ng persons who report breaches of EU law.

Chapter 33: Financial and budgetary provisions

Albania has some level of preparation in the area of financial and budgetary provisions. Limited progress was made on alignment with the EU acquis in the underlying policy fields that affect the functioning of the EU funding system. Methodological improvements continued on alignment with European system of accounts (ESA) 2010 standards. There were some limited improvements to the data transmission of the excessive deficit procedure (EDP) and government finance statistics (GFS) tables. However, data remains marked as non-publishable.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®continue aligning data on national accounts to ESA 2010 and improve the comprehensiveness of data transmission to Eurostat, including on the EDP and government finance statistics, as well as transparency by removing the flag non-publishable;

®align its legislation with EU rules on VAT and customs duties and strengthen efforts to tackle tax evasion and informality;

®improve administrative capacity and coordination mechanisms among key stakeholders in the own-resources system.

Cluster 6: External relations

Chapter 30: External relations

Albania has a good level of preparation in external relations. Some progress was made during the reporting period, in particular by adopting and implementing the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) protocols and through efforts to develop its export control system.

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were partially implemented and remain mostly valid. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®continue to implement CEFTA A dditional P rotocol 5 on T rade F acilitation,A dditional P rotocol 6 on T rade in S ervices, and A dditional P rotocol 7 on D ispute S ettlement, and implement actions under the new Common Regional Market action plan for 2025-2028;

®align the national legislation on the screening of foreign investments with the EU FDI Screening Regulation and ensure full alignment of domestic legislation with the EU R egulation on dual-use goods;

®set up the legal framework cover ing international cooperation and development policy and humanitarian aid, in line with EU policies and principles.

Chapter 31: Foreign, security and defence policy

Albania has a good level of preparation in the field of foreign, security and defence policy. The country continued to make good progress, maintaining its full alignment with relevant High Representative statements on behalf of the EU and relevant Council decisions, including EU restrictive measures. In December 2024, the EU-Albania Security and Defence Partnership was signed. Albania also stepped up its pa rticipation in EU crisis management missions and operations under the common security and defence policy (CSDP).

The Commission’s recommendations from last year were implemented. In the coming year, Albania should in particular:

®maintain full alignment with the EU’s common foreign and security policy and strengthen its capacity to enforce restrictive measures;

®consider further increasing its participation in EU crisis management missions and operations;

®adopt a new national small arms and light weapons (SALW) strategy aligned with the revised Roadmap for the control of SALW in the Western Balkans (2025-2030).

2. Cluster 1: The fundamentals of the accession process

2.1. Functioning of democratic institutions and public administration reform

2.1.1 Democracy

The functioning of democratic institutions in Albania is partially challenged, due to, among other factors, a deeply polarised political situation, the need for further electoral reform, failure by Parliament to implement certain Constitutional Court rulings, limited effective parliamentary oversight over the executive, the lack of meaningful public consultations.

Elections

The Electoral Code was amended in July 2024 and February 2025, partially responding to Constitutional Court rulings, and reflected in the May 2025 parliamentary election: the amendments enabled out-of-country voting, changed the preferential voting system, increased campaign spending limits, modified electoral deadlines and addressed airtime for candidates. However, further amendments to the electoral framework are needed to address outstanding OSCE/ODIHR recommendations and further align with democratic standards.

The parliamentary elections held on 11 May 2025 saw the Socialist Party secure 53.2% of the vote, translating to 83 seats in Parliament, up from 74 in the previous term. The Democratic Party led coalition obtained only 32.9% of the vote, falling to 50 seats, down from 63 in the previous term. Among the smaller parties, Albania Becomes secured one seat, the Opportunity Party two seats, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) three seats, and the Together Movement one seat.

The OSCE/ODIHR election observation mission’s preliminary conclusions indicated that the elections were competitive and professionally conducted but took place in a highly polarised environment and contestants did not enjoy a level playing field. Still, candidates were generally able to conduct their campaigns freely. The introduction of out-of-country voting was well managed and widely regarded as a landmark electoral development. The Specialised Structure Against Organised Crime and Corruption (SPAK) adopted a strategy to investigate electoral corruption. The new coordination mechanism between SPAK, the Central Election Commission (CEC) and the General Prosecutor’s Office led to better information sharing on electoral crimes and was seen as having a possible deterrent effect. Only limited changes to campaign financing have been enacted since 2020, with key OSCE/ODIHR and Venice Commission recommendations remaining unaddressed. Although most political parties signed a voluntary code of conduct on digital campaigns prior to the campaign, several contestants shared divisive, discriminatory and manipulative content. Monitoring efforts remained limited in scope and effectiveness.

Worrying developments were also observed, notably the fact that the ruling party benefited from the widespread use of administrative resources and institutional leverage, as well as concerns about the influence of patronage networks.

During the parliamentary election, 787 female candidates ran for a seat in Parliament (38.47% of all candidates). While this is a positive development, the OSCE/ODIHR election observation mission highlighted persistent gender stereotyping and discriminatory rhetoric against politically active women as significant barriers to participation.

Parliament

![Image 2](blob:http://localhost/95adaa2aafe86ad9937dbc33854cf79a)Parliament sessions continued to be marked by tensions, offensive language and occasional incidents. In October 2024, following a request by the majority,Parliament’s Ethics Secretariat temporarily suspended 23 members of the opposition for alleged violent acts in plenary session. This led to further disruptions, including friction s between opposition MPs and the Republican Guard.

Parliament failed to implement certain Constitutional Court rulings within the applicable deadline. In an opinion on the matter, the Venice Commission confirmed that the decisions of the Constitutional Court were compulsory for all state bodies, including Parliament. Parliament has not yet followed up on this Venice Commission opinion.


During the reporting period, Parliament made a number of appointments to independent institutions, including the High Judicial Council (HJC) and the High Prosecutorial Council (HPC). It also appointed a commissioner for the right to information and protection of personal data, and a public broadcaster steering committee. The appointments of an ombudsperson and a commissioner for protection from discrimination are still pending.

Parliament’s implementation of the legal framework for public consultation processes does not consistently lead to timely and transparent follow-up. In April 2025, Parliament introduced a new tool for public consultation.

Following the elections, women remain under-represented in Parliament, holding 51 of the 140 seats.

The current legal framework regarding political party financing lacks effectiveness due to the lack of a ceiling for candidate expenditure and the lack of clear regulation on advertising.

Concerns were also raised regarding the ad hoc parliamentary committee on deepening reforms for good governance, rule of law and anti-corruption. The risk of duplication with other parliamentary bodies dealing with European integration was noted. It is important that the work of the parliament in this area is inclusive, transparent and consistent with the positive results of the 2016 justice reform, guaranteeing the independence of justice institutions.

Governance

A new government took office following the 11 May 2025 parliamentary elections, composed of nine men and nine women. The appointment of a minister for the environment is a welcome development. A virtual entity was given the portfolio of Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence and Public Procurement under the authority of the Prime Minister.

During the reporting period, the ruling majority and the main opposition party employed rhetoric that was unfavourable towards the judiciary. This raises concerns about the need to maintain a clear separation between the executive branch and the judiciary.

While continuing to put EU-related reform at the centre of its legislative and policy planning, the government needs to refrain from rhetorics and measures that are not in line with EU standards. The transparency and openness of decision-making by the government needs to be improved. Coordination between ministries and executive institutions remains an issue and limits the delivery of quality public services. Further efforts are required to streamline the legal framework for the functions of local government units, address the low level of digitalisation and develop inter-municipal cooperation.

On local self-government/decentralisation, while there has been limited progress on the implementation of t he Cross-cutting Strategy on Decentralisation and Local Governance 2023-2030, some positive developments were noted. These include the 2024 municipal salary reform for civil servants and the ongoing impact of the 2015 territorial reform on increasing the financial autonomy and discipline of local governments with ad-hoc measures for 2025, though long-term solutions are needed. There is still a pressing need to increase local governments own revenues.

The wave of resignations and in some cases dismissals across local administrations that occurred in July 2025 following the central government public demand for management changes in municipalities raises concerns, including in view of the European Charter of Local Self-Government.

EU integration

Albania’s EU integration coordination structures, including the Minister of State / Chief Negotiator, the department in charge of EU integration in the Prime Minister’s Office, and the interinstitutional working groups, intensified their work during the reporting period. More financial and human resources are required to strengthen the European integration units in the line ministries and agencies.

T he government adopted the National Plan for European Integration 2025-2027. Work continued on developing the National Programme for Accession to the European Union, which aims to align the domestic regulatory framework with the EU acquis and ensure its effective implementation.

Parliament’s Standing Parliamentary Committee on European Affairs delivered its opinions on draft negotiation positions on negotiating clusters, and in 2024 reviewed 13 draft laws aiming to approximate the EU acquis. This Committee has been merged into a new Committee on European and Foreign Affairs, which is no longer chaired by the opposition, despite the wide cross-party consensus on EU accession. The National Council of European Integration has continued its activities, including reviewing key documents, such as roadmaps on opening accession negotiations on the fundamentals cluster, and raising awareness about fulfilling EU accession obligations.

Communication on European integration has focused on the opening of negotiation clusters and on the Growth Plan’s benefits. Further efforts need to be made to ensure transparency and public involvement in EU-related reform process.

Civil society

CSOs operate in a partly enabling environment, but have faced an increase in negative narratives particularly during the reporting period, including smear campaigns targeting their impartiality and funding. The national electronic register of non-profit organisations scheduled for the end of 2023 is not yet fully operational, tax incentives remain marginal and public funding is insufficient. The lack of specific measures to protect them from intimidation and legal threats (e.g. strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPP)) contributed to this situation. The role and protection of civil society should be further strengthened and the structures to meaningfully engage with civil society need to be reinforced and made fully operational, especially in the context of EU accession negotiations. The first meeting in April 2025 of the EU-Albania Joint Consultative Committee, which provides a new platform to Albanian CSOs, is an encouraging sign.

2.1.2. Public administration reform

Strategic framework for public administration reform

The strategic framework for public administration is in place.

The new Intersectoral Strategy Against Corruption (ISAC) 2024–2030 was adopted in December 2024 (see under ‘anti-corruption’ in Chapter 23). The Cross-Cutting Strategy on Public Administration Reform 2025–2030 was adopted in July 2025. Further progress was made on implementing the 2022-2026 Digital Agenda, but digital security and equal access for vulnerable groups remain an issue. Limited progress was made on implementing the 2023-2030 Strategy on Decentralisation and Local Governance. Institutional building, data collection, analysis, and aggregation capacities need to be further developed.

The revised civil service legislation for improving merit-based and senior-level recruitment and the amending legislation to regulate subordinated bodies remains to be adopted. The structure of the Integrated Policy Management Group is still under review and is largely not functional. The financial sustainability of reforms continues to depend heavily on external funding and needs to be improved.

Policy development and coordination

Policy development and coordination aspects still need to be developed.

The legal basis and the institutional set-up for consistent policymaking are in place, with room for improvement. More than one third of the approved draft laws in 2024 continued to originate from outside the Government Analytical Programme. The Strategic Planning Committee met regularly and steered the policymaking process. The Integrated Planning System (IPS) currently in place remained unused, mainly due to supporting IT systems being non-operational and the complexity of IPS requirements. Consistency between policy planning and budgeting remains to be improved. Further action is still needed to strengthen the administrative capacity of line ministries and the Prime Minister’s Office and make management more accountable. (See Chapter 32 – Financial control).

The administrative capacity for evidence-based policymaking and legislative development requires further improvement. In 2024, the use of regulatory impact assessments (RIAs) was limited to half of the approved draft laws based on the Council of Ministers’ interpretation of the criteria set out in the Council of Ministers’ rules of procedures. The government reported 53 RIAs in 2024 and 20 RIAs in the period from January to August 2025. The quality of the RIAs requires improvement. The percentage of legal acts undergoing public consultation needs to be further increased, based on a more comprehensive interpretation of the criteria set out in the Law on public consultation. In 2024, 78 acts were subject to consultation, out of a total of 80 adopted legal acts. Secondary legislation remains exempt from the application of the existing rules on public consultations and RIAs. More action is needed to further strengthen the quality control of consultations and ensure proper follow-up. The participation of stakeholders, in particular civil society, in public consultations needs to be further encouraged. Public scrutiny of government work is still weak, and parliamentary scrutiny of the government’s decision-making remains limited.

Public financial management

Public financial management (PFM) structures are broadly in place but need to be improved. The legal basis for PFM is mostly in place, with a comprehensive organic budget law. In December 2024, the government adopted a Medium-Term Revenue Strategy 2024 -2027 detailing tax policy, including the revision of tax exemptions, tax administration and customs reforms, with the objective of raising fiscal revenue/GDP by 2.5% by 2027.

The provisions of the organic budget law are largely followed. However, budget revisions are still carried out exclusively through normative acts adopted by the executive. More decisive action is needed to return to regular budget revision processes through Parliament. Some budgetary reforms continued, including ongoing efforts to better integrate medium-term budgets with the single project pipeline. The link between the strategic priorities and budget programmes should be further strengthened. T he application of gender responsive budgeting continued in 2024, with approximately 9.3% of the budget being dedicated to gender-based public policies. The traceability of the gender-based budget allocations needs to be strengthened. The level of arrears has fallen, but ongoing efforts to strengthen commitment compliance should continue. The debt strategy is being pursued by reducing public debt/GDP, lengthening debt maturities and lowering exchange risk exposure. Fiscal risk monitoring has been strengthened. However, fiscal risk reporting and risk assessment on fiscal risk related to state-owned enterprises and public-private partnerships remains to be further improved. An independent fiscal oversight institution (Fiscal Council) still needs to be set up.

Budget transparency is mostly satisfactory with all key budget documents regularly published. Yet, further improvements are needed on the production of consolidated financial statements, and on in-depth reporting on extra-budgetary entities.

Public services and human resources management

Public services and human resources management require further development. Rules on merit-based recruitment, promotion and dismissal are still applied inconsistently at all levels. The measures on salary increase taken at central level have been expanded to local administrations (See Section 2.1.1 Democracy, local self-government/decentralisation). Most civil servants continue to be recruited through a group or pool recruitment process. In 2024, from the total number of appointed candidates, 61% were women and 39% men. From January to August 2025, out of 248 appointments, 163 were women and 85 were man. Overall, the gender distribution is 66% female and 34% male. Women account for 59% of middle-level managerial positions and 44% of senior-level managerial positions. About one third of senior positions are still vacant despite the availability of a pool of candidates from the top management corps group. Recruitment for managerial positions still does not properly comply with the legislation in place in terms of opening vacancies to external candidates, which should remain only an exception. In 2024, there were 14 dismissals from the civil service, compared with 27 in 2023. The enforcement rate of final court decisions on dismissals and reinstatements increased to 86.6% in 2024, compared with 84.2% in 2023. However, government reactiveness to enforcing such decisions in a timely manner still needs further improvement. The current Human Resources Management Information System (HRMIS) still does not cover the entire public sector and cannot be used as an automated payroll system. Efforts to redesign the HRMIS accordingly remain needed. All Albanian ministries have an integrity plan. At local level, 35 out of 61 municipalities have integrity plans. However, the quality and implementation of integrity plans is still weak.

The Albanian School of Public Administration continued to deliver online training programmes for professional development. A new Director was appointed, and temporary physical premises have been made available for the administration staff only.

Accountability of administration

The accountability of the administration remains insufficient. The legal framework for the organisation of the central administration still lacks a foundation for the establishment and accountability of subordinated institutions and autonomous agencies. The typology laid down in the law is still applied inconsistently. The organisational set-up of the administration has become further centralised, with 25 authorities/agencies subordinated directly to the Prime Minister’s Office. The amendments to the law on organisation of state administration were submitted for public consultation and remain to be adopted. The legal framework for ensuring managerial accountability still needs to be improved. More action is needed to further strengthen the right of citizens to good administration. Less than half of the recommendations made by the People’s Advocate (PA) and other independent institutions to the public authorities are implemented. This implementation rate needs to be improved. Cooperation between Parliament and the PA should be further strengthened and the public administration bodies’ lack of responsiveness further addressed. On transparency and access to information, the Commissioner for the right to information reported a steady number of around 1 000 complaints in 2024, often resolved after his intervention. Public entities still need to improve compliance with transparency requirements and be more responsive to requests for access to information.

2.2. Rule of law and fundamental rights

2.2.1.Chapter 23: Judiciary and fundamental rights

The EU’s founding values include the rule of law and respect for human rights. An effective (independent, high-quality and efficient) judicial system and an effective fight against corruption are of paramount importance, as is the respect for fundamental rights in law and in practice.

A new Cross-Sector Justice Strategy for 2024-2030 was adopted but implementation still needs to be improved. The quality of the strategy and its monitoring are generally satisfactory. The quality and timeliness of reporting have improved. However, the quality of statistical data remains poor.

Management bodies

The efficiency of the High Judicial Council (HJC) and the High Prosecutorial Council (HPC) in appointing, promoting, transferring and evaluating magistrates remains very low, which affects judicial quality and efficiency at all levels. The HJC finalised forty-one evaluation reports and the HPC forty. The HJC and the HPC should continue to reduce the backlog of evaluations and improve the quality of the evaluation reports and adopt and implement an evaluation plan every year. Important operating rules are still lacking, and overall coordination still needs to be reinforced.

![Image 3](blob:http://localhost/fee92c8100159fb549a3d6c580d71a3b)The 2016 justice reform strengthened the Councils’ independence. However, previously identified shortcomings remain regarding the appointment of non-magistrate members to the HJC and H PC. They are not subject to the same standards as magistrate members for background checks and asset verification, which affect s the transparency and meritocracy of the process. The HPC and the HJC need to further strengthen ethical oversight of its members in practice.The HJC ha s adopted specific rules of procedure that regulate its own members’ conflicts of interes t. The HJC has enacted regulations on minimum judicial timeframes and quantitative standards, and standard templates for judicial decisions.Strategic communication remains weak.The rules of procedure to ensure transparency in relation to promotions, appointments and transfers, including evaluations have been approved by the HJC and their implementation should be further ensured. The HPC adopted regulations on mentoring of prosecutor-magistrate candidates. Regulating the appointment of court chairs is also important. The HJC and the HPC need to urgently address the lack of specialised resources, notably seconded magistrates and staff needed to perform evaluation reports, in line with the high vetting standards. Councils lack an internal structure and staff to train non-magistrate staff in courts and prosecution offices, as provided for in the law.

Independence and impartiality

The independence and impartiality of the judiciary is satisfactory in the higher-level courts and in the courts of first instance. While the resilience of the judiciary has improved, a ttempts by public officials or politicians to exert undue interference and pressure![Image 4](blob:http://localhost/d623469aadc88ee52fbaf5c117d312c9)have increased and raise serious concerns, notably the unprecedented public reactions and attempts to put pressure by the executive and legislative branches against the Specialised Structure Against Organised Crime and Corruption (SPAK) and the High Justice Inspector. Seven magistrates were placed under protection. T he self-governing institutions were vocal in denouncing political pressure on the judiciary, issuing public statements.

Albania needs to ensure a competitive and high standard evaluation and appointment procedure of the Chief Special Prosecutor at the Special Prosecution’s Office, in line with the highest principles of merit and independence.While the appointment process of the new Director of the National Bureau of Investigations has been open and competitive so far, there have been delays in the final appointment and the HPC should adopt clear rules and procedures for future occasions. Legal uncertainty remained regarding the end of the mandate of two members of the Constitutional Court, due to diverging interpretations of the applicable provisions by Parliament and the High Court, respectively.

Despite strong legal safeguards, merit-based appointments and career development are weakened in practice by the HPC and HJC’s slow pace of qualitative evaluations for magistrates and the continued use of transfers as an alternative to merit-based promotions.

![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/0183e0ce93b2b6ac4d1eed56489e6b3b)Accountability

![Image 6](blob:http://localhost/b763f44db0afb1b1ca68c494508db250)The accountability of the judiciary is overall satisfactory. The comprehensive transitional re-evaluation (vetting) of all judges and prosecutors, the operation of the High Justice Inspector (HJI) and the continued progress in implementing the justice reform have strengthened accountability.Efforts to prevent corruption post-vetting should be enhanced across the judicial system. The Councils and the HJI adopted a common regulation on cases of magistrates’ misconduct. T he Councils have also approved the regulatory acts to make “asset and background” checks for the remaining first instance vetting cases.

The vetting process has further advanced and is close to finalisation. T he Appeal Chamber increased the pace of appeals and is currently on track towards meeting the constitutional deadline of June 2026. As of 1 October 2025 the fi nal decisions resulted in 4 26 dismissals and terminations (52.9% of cases), and 3 21 confirmations in office (39.9% of cases). 53![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/16505d6a84baae88a47f331b0668197d)appeals remain pending.The International Monitoring Operation (IMO) continued its oversight of the process. The IMO issued 42 recommendations for appeal and eight dissenting opinions against Appeal Chamber decisions.

Challenges persist regarding the attractiveness of the position for magistrate-inspectors at the HJI and legal changes are still expected to address the issue. The HJI needs to strengthen inspection protocols to tackle corruption cases within the judiciary. Thematic inspections remain a priority, including a plan to coordinate with all the relevant institutions on their follow-up. The HJI, HJC, HPC and the High Inspectorate of Declaration and Audit of Assets and Conflicts of Interest (HIDAACI) should update their internal procedures and ensure sufficient staff and resources to improve the quality and efficiency of integrity checks on magistrates and candidate-magistrates in line with high vetting standards.

Quality of justice

![Image 8](blob:http://localhost/cfe21ae4fdf28d13671ad800d35cd042)The quality of justice needs to be improved. Measures are still needed to address the previously reported issues, including (i) the quality of initial and continuous training; (ii) the consistency of case law; (iii) the high number of judicial vacancies and insufficient amount of court staff; (iv) the lack of a modern integrated electronic case management system in courts and prosecution offices; (v) the quality, consistency and timely publication of judg ments; (vi) the quality of court infrastructure; and (vii) the reliability of statistical data.

Further improvements to the judicial training system are still necessary, including a comprehensive revision of the entry exam, despite limited changes made by the School of Magistrates. The review of continuous and initial training needs to be finalised to address quality limitations and the imminent needs of the judicial system. Legislation still needs to be adopted to ban vetted out magistrates or magistrates with a 15-year ban from high judicial office from taking up positions as training staff at the School for Magistrates. Common standards to consolidate drafting of judicial decisions still need to be adopted and implemented.

Judicial quality is seriously hampered by the lack of progress in appointing court chairs at all levels and the insufficient number of court staff, particularly legal assistants. The High Judicial Council has appointed 42 new judges in first instance courts of general jurisdiction. However, vacancies at the Appeal Court remain and should be completed as a matter of priority. Quotas determined by the HJC and the HPC for the School of Magistrates for the 2025-2028 class are an additional concern as they are largely insufficient to ensure that in the medium term, the needs of the system will be gradually addressed. Increasing the number and quality of candidate magistrates and legal assistants admitted to the SoM is essential.

![Image 9](blob:http://localhost/3d0ea512a39970b120919d4e2033117a)While the Government has allocated the necessary premises to the Court of Appeal, t he quality of court infrastructure remains overall poor. This has led to overcrowding and the continued opaque practice of hearings taking place in judges’ chambers. No progress was made on providing adequate security standards for judges and prosecutors. The fatal shooting of the Tirana Appeals Court Judge during a court hearing has further emphasised concerns regarding the inadequacy of court infrastructure as well as detrimental personal attacks directed at judges and prosecutors and underscored the need for measures to guarantee the safety of magistrates. At SPAK level, there is scope for even greater transparency and verifiability of interrogations, notably through new interrogation rooms.

Decisive steps should be taken by the HJC and the HPC to ensure the consolidation, publication, reporting, consistency and reliability of statistical data across the judicial system, based on a coordinated and harmonised regulatory framework applicable to the whole system. HJC adopted a regulatory framework for setting up specialised chambers, which should be effectively implemented.

Alternative dispute resolution remains underused in practice. Training for mediators advanced, including an improved public campaign by the Mediation Chamber to increase awareness and visibility. Referral to mediation remains limited. Attempts to provide for consolidated information on the possibility to use mediation and increase quality of the service should continue further.

Efficiency

![Image 10](blob:http://localhost/297dfc0ab73793bd84716468507812b3)The efficiency of the justice system is limited. Efficiency is still hampered by the increased length of proceedings and a large backlog of cases, notably at appeal level. The publication of final decisions continues to exceed the legal deadline, and serious delays are caused by insufficient management of court hearings and absent defence lawyers. The HJC has adopted an efficiency roadmap, but needs to take further steps, including revision of legislation in line with the general principles of justice reform and European standards.

![Image 11](blob:http://localhost/44d18552ba9beae820adcfcfce33b521)Sufficient budget has been allocated to set up a modern integrated electronic case management system in courts and prosecution offices, but full establishment is foreseen only for 2030. This timeline is detrimental to the overall quality of justice and needs to be advanced.

Significant efforts are needed to improve the digitalisation of justice systems. An electronic communication tool between the Tirana District Court and lawyers has been successfully piloted. However, the lack of funding to expand it to all courts, especially the General Appeal Court, is limiting its full potential to improve access to justice.

Fight against corruption

Track record

The track record in the fight against corruption has improved for high-level cases and has slightly deteriorated for non-high-level cases.

![Image 12](blob:http://localhost/04894b220c972e09f5245be659f6b59d)The Specialised Structure Against Organised Crime and Corruption (SPAK),comprising the Special Prosecution Office (SPO), the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and the anti-corruption and organised crime courts (SPAK courts of both first instance and appeal), further consolidated its positive results in the investigation, prosecution and convictions in high-level corruption cases, including those involving high-level politicians and officials as well as cases involving the protection of EU financial interests.

![Image 13](blob:http://localhost/b4933d7a15c3bf910f78fa4121af8f30)In 2024, the Special Court of Appeal for Corruption and Organised Crime (SPAK appeal court) delivered 24 final convictions with 106 persons convicted in final rulings in corruption cases, including 13 convictions in high-level cases.The Special Court for Corruption and Organised Crime (SPAK court of first instance) convicted 93 persons in cases of corruption. SPAK’s capacity in financial investigations has increased and the systematic use of financial investigations and asset confiscations has continued to improve. However, the number of referrals to SPAK from other authorities needs to increase and SPAK’s capacity and internal organisation to handle a a growing workload requires attention. (See also Chapter 24 – Justice, freedom and security).

Legal framework

The legal framework on the fight against corruption is broadly in place but needs to be improved regarding preventive measures. Some steps have been taken towards revising the conflict-of-interest legislation, although anti-corruption legislation remains complex and incomplete. Revised l egislation on conflict of interest, whistleblowers protection, political party financing, lobbying, donations and sponsorships, anti-money laundering, internal control and financial inspection still needs to be adopted. The Law on the police has been revised, but the state police remain highly vulnerable to corruption.

Strategic documents

The strategic documents are in place and are adequate. Albania adopted the Anti-Corruption Strategy for 2024-2030, targeting vulnerable sectors such as property, public procurement, health, education, customs and tax, including local governance and the private sector. SPAK adopted a Backlog Reduction Strategy 2025-2027, which contributes to the implementation of the Cross-sector Justice Strategy and the National Strategy Against Organised Crime. However, further strengthening of institutional capacities, planning, coordination and monitoring mechanisms remain needed.

Institutional framework

The institutional framework for the fight against corruption is in place. Its preventive measures still need to be improved, and issues with its law enforcement aspects remain.

Since its establishment, SPAK has delivered positive results in fighting corruption. Other bodies tasked with fighting corruption, in particular the General Prosecution Office and the state police, still need to improve their results in fighting corruption.

Despite efforts, the state police remain highly vulnerable to corruption. The transitional and periodic evaluation of state police officers (‘police vetting’) and the process of integrity verification have continued, but their impact remains limited. In 2024, the Police Oversight Agency continued to receive a high number of complaints (over 5 000). The Agency recommended disciplinary investigations for 283 employees and referred 463 law enforcement employees to criminal prosecution. Following the resignation of the General Director in July, the appointment procedure for the new Head of Agency needs to be conducted in line with the highest principles of merit, competitiveness and transparency. Measures to improve the accountability, independence and integrity of the Albanian state police need to be further implemented.

The institutional framework for preventing corruption continues to have a limited impact, including in vulnerable sectors, and coordination with law enforcement remains weak. The position of Minister of State for Anti-Corruption and Public Administration has been maintained in the new executive. The General Directorate on Anti-Corruption (GDAC) staff are still limited to approximately 30 employees, supported by anti-corruption coordinators deployed across about 20 institutions, hindering capacities to effectively oversee the implementation and assessment of preventive measures, along with thorough risk assessments.

The High Inspectorate for the Declaration of Assets and Conflicts of Interest (HIDAACI) continued carrying out its mandate. Effectiveness and transparency of verifications of declarations of assets and interests by HIDAACI, including high-risk profiling, needs to be increased. The declarations of assets need to be made public online, in line with legal requirements. Coordination with law enforcement needs to further improve. HIDAACI introduced a search functionality to improve access to data yet still upon request, and signed a memorandum with the Financial Investigation Unit.

HIDAACI received 182 reports from public authorities and 258 from businesses last year. At the same time, the number of whistle-blowing cases remained low – HIDAACI reviewed six new whistleblower reports in 2024.

Public officials’ awareness of ethical standards and their enforcement needs to be improved. The quality and implementation of integrity plans, set up at central and local levels, still remains weak.

In March 2025, the Council of Europe’s Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) finished the fifth round compliance procedure for Albania, concluding that 18 out of 24 recommendations had been satisfactorily addressed. Albania still needs to ensure that rules on post-employment restrictions apply both to members of the Council of Ministers and to political advisers. In addition, legislation on contacts with lobbyists still needs to be enacted and the enforcement of rules to prevent conflicts of interest applicable to the Council of Ministers still needs to be demonstrated.

Fundamental rights

General framework

The general framework for fundamental rights needs to be improved. The implementation and enforcement of fundamental rights need to be improved.

International human rights instruments

Cooperation with international human rights monitoring bodies is satisfactory but the follow-up of their recommendations needs to be improved. Albania is party to the main international human rights instruments. However, the country has not signed the Optional Protocol to the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Albania needs to develop a comprehensive monitoring and data collection system to assess the level of implementation of human rights legislation, policies, and strategies. Albania completed its fourth Universal Periodic Review, supporting 239 out of 253 recommendations received. Albania continued to benefit from its observer status at the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA).

European Court of Human Rights

![Image 14](blob:http://localhost/c5ba5f20d8752646bd7dc90998e9ea99)Albania continues to ensure good cooperation with the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). During the reporting period, the Court found breaches of the European Convention on Human Rights relating mainly to the right to respect for private and family life, the right to a fair trial, and the right to liberty and security. Albania faces challenges in implementing ECtHR judgments. On 1 January 2025, Albania had 25 leading ECtHR judgments pending implementation. There are currently 10 cases under enhanced supervision by the Committee of Ministers compared to 16 in 2024).Albania needs to ensure that these judgments are implemented, notably in the Strazimiri v. Albania case, regarding the inhumane and degrading treatment of forensic psychiatric patients and prisoners with mental disorders. Moreover, Albania has yet to clarify existing remedies to address unlawful expropriation and demolition of property in the Sharxhi and others v. Albania case.

Promotion and enforcement of human rights

![Image 15](blob:http://localhost/157ec1e825589da5171ebf66f0f77fb5)The legal and institutional framework for the promotion, protection and enforcement of human rights is incomplete and needs to be improved. E ffective promotion and enforcement of human rights is challenging, especially on the right to property and children’s rights.The Ombudsperson (People’s Advocate) continued to exercise its mandate satisfactorily. It has been accredited at global level as an A-status National Human Rights Institution (NHRI) since 2014.Parliament has yet to reappoint an Ombudsperson and a Commissioner against Discrimination, as the mandate s of the current h eads of these institutions expired in 2022 and 2023, respectively, which risks to seriously weaken the legitimacy of these independent institutions. Human and financial resources shortages persist, affecting the functioning of the regional offices of both institutions. Overall, the largest number of complaints received by the Ombudsperson in 2024 concerned the limitation of personal freedom (295 complaints, 16% overall). Implementation of the Ombudsperson’s recommendations remains overall low, hampering oversight effectiveness and hindering redress for violations of human rights.

Prevention of torture and ill-treatment

![Image 16](blob:http://localhost/bdbc528c1ac828724b55d6d869b51f92)Albania provides adequate legal guarantees on the prevention of torture and ill-treatment and the follow-up of cases is adequate. Albania generally complies with its obligations on the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment.The functioning of the National Preventive Mechanism remained satisfactory; however, the follow-up of its recommendations is low.Albania’s action plan to address the main findings and recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) need to be implemented. No steps have been taken to address serious concerns over the conditions for prisoners with mental health issues and forensic patients. O vercrowding, a lack of medical and therapeutic staff, and inadequate facilities remain serious concern s.

![Image 17](blob:http://localhost/72176570a4a55e4f1dd3fa109623ab00)Execution of criminal sanctions

![Image 18](blob:http://localhost/c46096ca458bc7f8255fd94a130d4ffb)The system for execution of criminal sanctions (including probation) needs to be improved.C orruption, poor healthcare and a shortage of staff in the penitentiary system and detention centres remain a concern. While overcrowding remains a challenge, the occupancy rate has shown a steady annual decline, indicating gradual progress towards easing capacity pressures. The probation service is operational. However, prevention and rehabilitation need to be improved. The use of electronic monitoring has been suspended since 2017 and needs to be reintroduced urgently. Special attention should be paid to the deradicalisation of prisoners.

Protection of personal data

![Image 19](blob:http://localhost/3c9f954eef9aa441793be2f050c18760)The legal framework for the protection of personal data is adequate but the capacities of the D ata P rotection A gency still need to be improved.Good progress was achieved with the adoption of the new Law on personal data protection in December 2024 in full alignment with the EU acquis. Seven out of ten accompanying pieces of implementing legislation have been adopted. Albania needs to ensure effective implementation, including administrative and budgetary capacity. Further action is needed to increase public awareness and public institutions’ preventive capacity. The Data Protection Commissioner is systematically consulted on draft legislation that can affect personal data, and its recommendations are broadly followed by public and private data controllers.

Freedom of religion or belief

Freedom of thought, conscience and religion is generally upheld in Albania. The restitution of properties belonging to religious groups that were expropriated during the communist era remains an unresolved issue. The dependence of some religious groups on financial support from third parties creates vulnerabilities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Freedom of expression

Intimidation of journalists

The framework for the protection of journalists is in place, but verbal and physical attacks, smear campaigns and strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPP) targeting journalists continued. Media freedom organisations denounced 45 cases of violations of journalists’ safety in 2024 (down from 46 in 2023). Cases of intimidation and threats against journalists, including by high state officials and police officers and notably against investigative and female journalists, became more prominent though smear campaigns, politically motivated physical and verbal attacks, and disinformation.

In October 2024, the General Prosecutor’s Office appointed a media adviser as the contact person for reporting and following up on cases of attacks against journalists and media workers. A point of contact for the safety of journalists was established both at the Ministry of Interior and the police. Impunity persisted due to the continued lack of a robust track record of investigations and judicial follow-up. In April 2025, the Constitutional Court issued a decision in favour of a journalist, unanimously annulling previous judicial rulings that had authorised the seizure by the Special Prosecution Office of the journalist’s electronic devices, data and materials, on the grounds that the seizure constituted disproportionate interference in the right to protect the confidentiality of journalistic sources.

Concerns over the legality and due process of law were raised regarding the authorities’ action in preventing access of journalists from four media outlets to the premises they occupied. In August 2025, a first instance court assessed that restriction measures on journalists during the eviction of a media consortium from the state-owned premises were not proportionate and were contrary to constitutional and ECHR Article 10 obligations related to freedom of expression. The Court did not enter into the merits of the property dispute but ordered the return of the equipment and documents to journalists.

The number of digital threats, online harassment and smear campaigns increased. Privacy violations represent another serious concern, as journalists’ personal and professional data is misused by unauthorised entities. This situation is exacerbated by insufficient institutional mechanisms for reporting, addressing and mitigating these digital threats. There is still a lack of systemic monitoring and reporting on judicial cases involving journalists. Journalists have limited access to legal assistance and limited support from media outlets.

Legislative environment

Albania made no progress in aligning the legislative framework with the EU acquis and European standards. This includes no progress to address major challenges hampering media independence. High market concentration and lack of transparency of media ownership, financing sources and economic interests, including public funding, continued to negatively affect media independence and plurality. Defamation is still a crime punishable by particularly punitive criminal fines. The Criminal Code still does not provide for special protection for journalists against violence, attacks or threats while exercising their profession. The legal framework does not provide for safeguards against strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPP). A structured dialogue between Albanian institutions and media actors was launched in January 2025 with the aim of discussing key legislative and regulatory reforms to enhance freedom of expression, including media freedom and pluralism. Following a presentation of specific recommendations in June 2025, the work of the platform is still ongoing. It remains essential that the Venice Commission be consulted on the resulting legislative amendments before they are adopted. The Law on access to information is broadly aligned with European standards; however, shorter and binding deadlines for answers to journalists still need to be set based on best European practices.

Implementation of legislation/institutions

The independence of the Audio-Visual Regulatory Authority (AMA) is still not guaranteed as the potential for political and corporate influence with regard to the appointment procedures for AMA board members persists, while there have been shortcomings in enforcing the Broadcasting Code on media outlets that air pre-recorded political content during electoral campaigns.

The ad hoc parliamentary committee on tackling disinformation and foreign interference drafted the country’s first National Strategy against foreign interference and disinformation, adopted by Parliament in July 2025. In its implementation it is important that the strategy ensures a comprehensive approach and safeguards freedom of expression, media freedom, and pluralism in line with the EU acquis and best practices.

The implementation of the Law on access to public information remains weak. Public authorities continue the practice of withholding information on the basis of generic references to ‘public interest’ that have still not been clearly defined. In 2024, the Commissioner for the Right to Information and Personal Data Protection received 365 complaints from journalists concerning the refusal to provide information and official documents. Of these, 283 cases were resolved by granting the requested information during the administrative review process.

Public service broadcaster

Procedural irregularities in the election process for a new Director-General of the public broadcaster Radio Television (RTSH) in January 2025 further undermined the principles of merit-based selection and increased concerns over the independence of RTSH. In February, Parliament dismissed the entire RTSH Steering Council, in breach of applicable legislation, which only allows individual disqualification of Steering Council members subject to due process guarantees. The appointment of some members of the new Council, set up in March 2025, raised concern because of their political background. In April 2025, the new board elected the Director-General of RTSH.

Economic factors

High ownership concentration and opaque funding practices continue to compromise media independence and pluralism. In April 2024, the AMA started publishing on its website summarised information on ownership structures and beneficial owners of licensed audiovisual media. However, this webpage fails to indicate vested interests of owners, conflicts of interest, and possible influences on media owners or persons affiliated with them. The legal framework still lacks provisions to regulate the distribution of indirect subsidies or state advertising to media, and to extend transparency requirements to online media outlets. Albania has taken an initial step towards a transparent audience measurement system, which is key to ensuring accountability in public advertising. Concerns persist on the influence of politically affiliated business groups, particularly during the pre-electoral period.

Internet

In March 2025, the government decided to suspend access to a major social media platform nationwide for 12 months on the grounds of protecting children from harmful content. While there was no formal announcement on lifting of the ban, the platform is accessible across the country following an agreement to ensure filters for hate speech in Albanian. The cybersecurity capacity of media outlets is generally weak. Several cyberattacks against the media took place during the reporting period.

Professional organisations and working conditions

Self-regulation in the media sector remained weak and hindered by limited resources, a polarised media landscape and ongoing use of inflammatory rhetoric in public debate. It remains important to ensure support to self-regulatory initiatives and to promote sector-wide adherence to ethical codes.

Limited job security and poor working conditions for journalists, combined with self-censorship and pressure from political actors and media owners, continued to pose serious challenges to journalists. Issues remain with unpaid salaries, excessive workloads and job insecurity, particularly in local and online media. Media freedom organisations reported at least 13 new formal complaints to the State Labour Inspectorate between September 2024 and March 2025. Self-censorship remains widespread, driven by political pressure, legal threats and economic dependence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Freedom of assembly and association is guaranteed by the constitution and continued to be generally respected.

Labour and trade union rights are covered in Chapter 19 - Social policy and employment.

Property rights

The legal and institutional framework to enforce property rights is broadly in place. The overall enjoyment of property rights is limited. Further progress has been made on digitalisation but thus far only 91% of lands have been registered. Digitalisation was completed only with respect to 43% of ownership titles, 69% of supporting documents and 10% of cadastral maps. Approximately 80% of previously registered data has still not been verified for accuracy. Significant challenges persist, including widespread corruption in service delivery, unclear ownership and overlapping property boundaries resulting from inconsistent interventions and faulty measurements in recent decades. Many title deeds and cadastral maps are still in paper format, and numerous property transactions are still conducted using outdated documents with unclear data, hampering legal certainty and economic development. In June 2025, the State Cadastre Agency (SCA) adopted a roadmap to finalise all digitisations by December 2026 and all first-time registrations of immovable property by December 2028. The process of legalising illegal construction projects due before the end of 2028 continued, with some 64% out of 400 000 applications legalised and 1% rejected.

In light of country-wide demolitions of allegedly illegal constructions launched by the authorities in the summer of 2025, it is important that legalisation, expropriation and demolition of buildings strictly comply with existing legal frameworks, including the principles of transparency and due judicial process.

In late 2024, a working group was established to develop an integrity plan at the SCA.

Compensations for properties confiscated during the communist era continued but at a slow pace. More than 26 000 requests for compensation have been accepted by the specialised Agency for Treatment of Property (ATP). ATP recognised ownership and compensation values in 19 000 cases and only effectively executed about 800 of them. One major issue is that only 10% of the property value can be compensated, and that value is still based on the government’s valuation map dating back to 2016, with prices often significantly below current market values.

Non-discrimination

The legal and institutional framework on non-discrimination is incomplete and the capacities of equality bodies need to be improved.

Limited steps were taken to fully align the legal and institutional framework for non-discrimination with the EU acquis - including on racial equality and on standards for equality bodies and European standards. In 2024, the Commissioner for Protection against Discrimination (CPD) continued to handle a stable number of cases, mostly in the areas of employment and services. Albania needs to consistently implement strategic measures on combating discrimination and strengthening the rights of LGBTIQ persons and persons with disabilities, including sectoral non-discrimination action plans.

Serious concerns remain with regard to the institutional and legal framework on hate crime and hate speech. Laws on hate crime and hate speech appear to be consistent with EU acquis and European standards. However, better enforcement capacity and greater awareness raising are needed, particularly in rural and remote areas. In 2024, the CPD handled twelve cases of hate speech, including on the grounds of race, gender and sexual orientation, confirming hate speech in two of the cases. From January to June 2025, the CPD handled eleven new cases, which are under review. Additional training, awareness raising and capacity building about hate crime is needed among law enforcement and justice professionals. The collection of data and statistics on hate crime is yet to be fully ensured. A total of seven cases of hate crime were reported to the police in the reporting period in 2024 and 8 from January to June 2025

![Image 20](blob:http://localhost/a58846080341a56e84309e50f13b7b1f)Gender equality

The legal and institutional framework for g ender equality is partially in place, but leg islative alignment with the EU acquis as well as implementation and enforcement need to be improved.Weaknesses remain in implementing the National Strategy for Gender Equality 2021-2030 and its Action Plan. Women living in rural and remote areas, Roma[3](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025SC0750#footnote4) and Egyptian women, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ)persons continue to face multiple forms of discrimination. The activities in preparing Local Gender Action Plans continued.

The legal framework for combating gender-based violence is not aligned with the Istanbul Convention or the EU acquis. Violence against women and girls and domestic violence remain a critical concern, with high levels of under-reporting due to social norms and associated stigma. ![Image 21](blob:http://localhost/00b0143969f9ee12f1ec66c473051a17)47% of women and girls report having been victims of intimate partner violence. The police’s w eak enforcement and accountability in handling cases of violence against women remains a concern. The continued high number of femicides per capita is still a serious concern. Specialised support services for victims of violence continue to be donor driven and insufficient, particularly healthcare, the funding of shelters, free legal aid, and the reintegration and rehabilitation of victims of violence. Several key laws are currently being revised, including the L aw on gender equality in society, the C riminal C ode with regard to the crimes of femicide, sexual violence and cyber violence, and the F amily C ode concerning child marriages. It remains important that revisions are fully aligned with EU acquis and European standards.

Rights of the child

the legal and institutional framework on rights of the child is partially in place and implementation needs to be improved. Implementation efforts in children’s rights protection should also be in line with the EU acquis and draw guidance from key European Commission recommendations, in particular as concerns integrated child protection systems.

The National Agenda on the Rights of the Child (NARC) 2021-2026 is Albania’s central strategic framework for promoting and protecting children’s rights. Only 62% of the measures in the NARC had been fully implemented. Laws intended to protect minors from child marriage remain ineffective or applied inconsistently. Child protection services remain insufficient, including for child victims of violence and domestic violence. In 2024, 1 913 cases have been registered as victim of violence. Violence and sexual violence against children, including online, remain a critical area of concern. Child protection services remain insufficient, including for child victims of violence. The number of child protection workers (241 in all 61 municipalities) is far below the total number needed. In 2024, 2 451 cases were managed by Child Protection Units, 1 386 of which were newly identified cases receiving services according to their risk levels. In 2025, there were 1,940 cases of children in need of protection of which 264 newly identified cases. A national deinstitutionalisation plan is in place and currently being updated together with the development of the new alternative care law as well as measures to strengthen service delivery for children in need of family care. Access to justice for children is hindered by delays, limited legal aid, and inadequate institutional coordination. Despite the National social Protection Strategy 2024-2030 and Social Inclusion Policy 2024-2028, 70% of children remain at risk of poverty.

Persons with disabilities

The legal and institutional framework on the rights of persons with disabilities is incomplete and implementation and enforcement need to be improved. Albania’s framework legislation on the rights of persons with disabilities is only partially compliant with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), and Albania has not yet ratified the Optional Protocol to the UNCRPD on an individual complaints’ mechanism. Limited action was taken to tackle discrimination against persons with disabilities, improve accessibility in line with the EU acquis, including as regards the European Accessibility Act and boost opportunities in employment, education and participation in political and public life. The quality of education for children with disabilities, especially children with a hearing impairment, continues to cause concern. There has been limited progress on deinstitutionalisation, which needs to be dealt with urgently to move towards independent living and inclusion of persons with disabilities. Some progress was noted on biopsychosocial assessment, but service provision needs to be strengthened.

LGBTIQ persons

The legal protection of the rights of LGBTIQ persons needs to be improved and further aligned with the EU acquis. Moreover, LGBTIQ persons face high levels of discrimination and there is a lack of inclusive data collection.

The legal and institutional framework for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ) persons is incomplete and needs to be further aligned with the EU acquis and European standards. Albania still does not have legislation recognising civil cohabitation, same-sex marriage, parenthood by same-sex couples, or legal gender recognition. The medical protocol for transgender and gender-diverse persons has not been adopted yet. Most of the measures under the LGBTIQ National Action Plan 2021-2027 have not been implemented due to lack of resources and lack of political will.]. Discrimination against LGBTIQ persons is prevalent. Tirana Pride took place peacefully on 24 May 2025.

Procedural rights and victims’ rights

The legal framework on procedural rights for suspects and accused persons as well as the rights of victims of crime is partially aligned with the EU acquis.

The legal framework for legal aid is comprehensive, and primary and secondary legal aid are delivered at central and local levels. However, fees for legal aid cases are still not sufficient to attract high-quality legal representation. Measures to facilitate access to justice for the most vulnerable groups in view of the new judicial map are not yet in place. Shortcomings remain regarding sufficient budget and coordination to protect victims of crime. There was no progress from the 2024 report in addressing remaining issues related to the procedural rights of suspects and accused persons, including elements pertaining to the right to information in criminal proceedings, access to a lawyer and presumption of innocence. The budget for victim support, protection and victim compensation is still largely insufficient and needs to be enhanced.

Protection of minorities

The legal and institutional framework for the protection of persons belonging to minorities needs to be improved and further aligned with the EU acquis. Persons belonging to minorities face discrimination. A significant achievement was made with the adoption of three pieces of implementing legislation in December 2024, which were needed to ensure implementation of the relevant framework legislation. This implementing legislation addressed the crucial issues of free self-identification and the use of languages for persons belonging to minorities, ensuring alignment with European standards and the principle of free self-identification.

Albania still needs to ensure effective implementation of the legal framework, notably by allocating adequate financial and human resources to central agencies and local government, and by staffing and training local authorities, including on data collection, based on annual projections. Albania still needs to ensure that the State Committee on National Minorities has adequate resources and that procedures for selecting the members of the Committee on National Minorities are reviewed in line with the recommendations of the European Commission and of the Advisory Committee of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities.

Roma

The legal and institutional framework on Roma needs to be further improved and Roma continue to face discrimination. The overall employment rate of Roma and Egyptians remains very low. While access to basic public health services is ensured, access to additional out-of-pocket health services remains financially constrained for both vulnerable communities. The cost of civil registration remains a challenge when DNA testing is required. The implementation of the National Action Plan for equality, inclusion and participation of Roma and Egyptians in Albania (2021-2025) and the Poznan commitments needs to be significantly improved. The institutional capacity of the Ministry of Health and Social Protection remained weak throughout the reporting period, however, the appointment of a new Deputy Minister specifically in charge of vulnerable groups, including Roma and Egyptians was a positive sign. Additional efforts and resources are required to accelerate the inclusion of Roma and Egyptians, to tackle anti-gypsyism, discrimination and educational and physical segregation, to promote Roma participation, and to reduce the gaps with the rest of the population.

Citizenship rights

Albania needs to adapt its legislative framework to the EU acquis on EU citizenship rights, with the ultimate aim of full alignment ahead of accession. This should includ e carrying out an analysis of the alignment and implementation needs arising from the EU Directive on the right to citizens of the Union to move and reside freely in the Member States across all policy areas affected and planning timely alignment accordingly.To ensure full compliance with EU law[4](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025SC0750#footnote5), Albania will need to repeal the legal basis allowing for the development of an investor citizenship scheme, as such schemes breach EU law and pose risks as regards security, money laundering, tax evasion, terrorist financing, corruption and infiltration by organised crime.

2.2.2.Chapter 24: Justice, freedom and security

The EU has common rules for border and migration management, visa policy, and asylum.. Schengen cooperation entails the lifting of border controls inside the EU. There is also cooperation in the fight against serious and organised crime and terrorism, and judicial, police and customs cooperation, all with the support of the EU Justice and Home Affairs agencies.

Fight against serious and organised crime

The legal framework on serious and organised crime is partially aligned with the EU acquis. The capacity to fight against serious and organised crime needs to be improved.

Legal alignment, strategic and institutional frameworks

Albania is partially aligned with the EU acquis in the field of police cooperation and the fight against organised crime. Implementation of the 2021-2025 inter-sectoral strategy against serious and organised crimes and the 2023-2025 action plan is in its final stages. An evaluation report on their implementation should be prepared to inform the drafting of the new strategy for 2026-2030. The National Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment (SOCTA) for the period 2024-2025 was approved in September 2024 but is not publicly available. The assessment of its implementation as well as of its alignment with the national strategy against organised and serious crimes cannot therefore be carried out.

An Asset Recovery Office (ARO) has been set up within the Albanian State Police, although its full functionality remains to be demonstrated. The Law on the Asset Recovery Office was adopted in June 2025 and its full implementation, including the adoption of pending implementing legislation on the organisation and functioning of the office, should increase its capacities to identify and trace criminal assets.

With a view to alignment with the EU Directive on asset recovery and confiscation, the capacity of the Agency for the Administration of Seized and Confiscated Assets (i.e. the national Asset Management Office) is to be reinforced. In 2024 the Agency increased its human resources and set up an inventory of seized and confiscated assets. Operational procedures need to be further improved to ensure timely management of assets to preserve their economic value.

Regarding SPAK, the financial investigation unit of the Special Prosecution Office (SPO) continued operating, leading to tangible results, including in cooperation with international partners. The appointment of the Deputy Director of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) in December 2024 fulfilled a precondition, as envisaged by the SPAK Law, for the recruitment of judicial police services officers, but their recruitment is still pending. The number of state databases to which the SPO and NBI have direct access has increased to 19 and reached a sufficient level, but further improvements in analysis capabilities are needed.

District prosecution offices lack the staff, training and resources required to improve criminal and financial analysis capacity in complex criminal cases.

The 2024 Law on the Albanian State Police is providing the adequate legal framework to contribute to the reduction of corruption and conflicts of interest regarding donations, sponsorship and additional paid services. A system for confidential integrity counselling has been set up. While a whistle-blowing system and post-employment restrictions have now been implemented, integrity checks for at-risk functions need to be conducted regularly.

No progress was made on alignment with the EU acquis on cybercrime and criminalisation of child sexual abuse and exploitation both online and offline during the reporting period. The legal framework needs to be swiftly aligned with the Directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.

The legal framework for trafficking in human beings is partially aligned with the EU acquis. It should be amended to align with the Directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting trafficking victims and the revised Directive which entered into force in July 2024. Domestic child trafficking forced begging and child labour are a concern despite policies that are consistent with international standards.

On small arms and light weapons, Albania should fully comply with the EU Directive on the control of acquisition and possession of weapons, as well as implementing legislation on alarm and signal weapons and marking of firearms.

Implementation and enforcement capacity

![Image 22](blob:http://localhost/8d5136c74f1a4b124331bccedc0633bd)Criminal and financial investigation analysis and methodologies need to be strengthened. Albania is expected to increase its use of preventive seizure and confiscation of assets, including non-conviction-based confiscation and third-party confiscation. Financial investigations have been prioritised by SPAK, which is reflected in an increase in high-level cases.

Financial investigation techniques need to be improved, including on identification, analysis and preservation of digital evidence for cryptocurrency and virtual assets. The systematic use of financial investigations in parallel to serious and organise crime and money laundering cases should be ensured. The level of asset seizures and confiscations remained stable between 2023 and 2024. Albania reported about EUR 21 million worth of seized assets (EUR 21 million in 2023) and EUR 10 million worth of confiscated assets (EUR 11 million in 2023).

There is a need to guarantee the timely and proper management of seized and confiscated assets, including virtual assets and cryptocurrency, as no state-owned digital wallet is available.

![Image 23](blob:http://localhost/0a131be6781e67f67a41ae4b6960d771)There is still no strategic or systematic approach to identifying and confiscating criminal assets that are abroad or unreachable. In 2024, SPAK issued seven decisions for the preventive seizure of assets for criminal offen c es related to organised crime. However, Albania needs to steadily implement rules on extended confiscation and precautionary asset freezing to prevent the assets losing any of their economic value.

The reuse of confiscated assets for social purposes remains largely ineffective.

On international police cooperation, a total of 108 police operations were carried out in cooperation with international partners in 2024. Albania should continue and strengthen its cooperation with international partners, in particular with EU Member States and EU agencies. There was a 6,2% increase in messages shared by the Albanian State Police with international partners via the Secure Information Exchange Network Application (SIENA) in 2024.

Albania continued its good cooperation with Europol and remains actively engaged in the European Multidisciplinary Platform against Criminal Threats (EMPACT): the country participated in 120 operational actions carried out in the period 2024-2025 (115 in 2023). Albania also participated in the INTERPOL I-24/7 system, with 25% more joint operations than in 2023.

Cooperation between Albania and the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL) continues, but Albania should make more use of it by integrating the gained knowledge and competencies into the national law enforcement training system. The revision of the Working Arrangement with CEPOL is ongoing.

![Image 24](blob:http://localhost/c426796a8905136e519f8e5d4aee1fd9)Albania continued to strengthen the fight against money laundering. The national strategy against money laundering and terrorist financing 2024-2030 adopted in July 2024 needs to be implemented effectively by all relevant actors in coordination with relevant law enforcement authorities. (See also Chapter 4 – Free movement of capital)

Albania should leverage its access to CEPOL trainings to must develop its capacity to investigate cybercrime to meet the EU’s 2022-2025 priorities for EMPACT.

Albanian authorities need to strengthen their capacity to detect, investigate and prosecute traffickers of human beings and fully implement the National Referral Mechanism for victims of trafficking. In 2024, Albania identified 178 victims, including 113 women and girls and 96 children.

On trafficking in firearms, Albania continued to strengthen its operational response, with progress noted on preventing, countering, investigating and prosecuting cases related to trafficking of weapons and ammunition. During 2024, 636 firearms, 32 411 pieces of ammunition and 2375 grams of explosives were seized. The number of domestic-violence-related firearms incidents remains high, and the capacities of law enforcement to handle cases of gender-based violence should be further improved.

Cooperation in the field of drugs

Cooperation in the field of drugs needs to be improved.

Legal alignment, strategic and institutional frameworks

Albania is partially aligned with the EU acquis in the field of drugs and still does not have a comprehensive and dedicated national drugs strategy.

Albania is party to the main international conventions on drugs but needs to ensure full alignment with these conventions with regard to the criminalisation of the trafficking of illicit drugs and on the transmission of samples of controlled substances. Albania should ensure full compliance with the EU acquis on criminal acts and penalties in respect of drug trafficking including in respect to new psychoactive substances.

![Image 25](blob:http://localhost/ef6a2145851429ab7aa61a7e15b9d090)In July 2025, Albania formally established a national drugs observatory, which is still to become operational, while the functioning and output of the national early warning system on the detection of new psychoactive substances set up within the Albanian State Police needs to be increased. Further amendments to the L aw on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances were adopted in December 2024.

On the legal cultivation of cannabis for medical and industrial purposes, the National Cannabis Control Agency is active, and Albania has adopted 21 pieces of implementing legislation, including security-related provisions. Strong safeguards to prevent cannabis from being diverted to unintended use are essential and should be further developed and put in place strictly if cultivation starts in the upcoming period.

Implementation and enforcement capacity

International police and judicial cooperation are well established. Albania is actively engaged in EMPACT priorities in the field of narcotics. Most of the joint investigation teams in which Albania takes part are in the field of narcotics, confirming last year’s trend. Operational cooperation aimed at addressing drug production and trafficking in and via Albania and Albanian organised crime groups should be further enhanced.

Further efforts are needed in financial investigations to seize and confiscate the criminal assets of drug traffickers and increase the identification and the dismantling of Albanian criminal groups.

Implementation of the working arrangements with the EU Drugs Agency requires more proactive engagement, better interinstitutional coordination and regular information exchange.

![Image 26](blob:http://localhost/08efbe9c9bc99549c0f08d0db522107d)There has been a significant increase in drugs destruction in 2024, due almost exclusively to cannabis destruction. The number of cases of drug production and trafficking remain ed broadly stable in 2024 (compared to 2023), but with a substantial increase in the number of individuals and legal entities receiving a final court decision and/or a final conviction in 2024.

Fight against terrorism and prevention of radicalisation and violent extremism

The legal framework for the fight against terrorism and for countering violent extremism is partially aligned with the EU acquis. The fight against terrorism and the countering of violent extremism is broadly satisfactory.

The legal framework for critical infrastructure protection is not aligned with the EU acquis. The protection of critical infrastructure needs to be improved.

Legal alignment, strategic and institutional frameworks

Albania’s legal framework in the field of terrorism is partially aligned with the EU acquis. It needs to align its legislation on explosive precursors with the EU acquis. A cross-cutting strategy on prevention of violent extremism and counter terrorism 2023-2025 and related action plans, and a strategy against money laundering and terrorist financing 2024-2030 and related action plans are in place.

Albania has a national coordinator for countering violent extremism, who heads the Coordination Center for Countering Violent Extremism, created in 2017.

The level of preparation to protect critical infrastructure remained low during the reporting period. The Law on the protection of critical infrastructure is not yet adopted and should be aligned with the EU Directive on the resilience of critical entities. The protection of critical infrastructure in the area of cybersecurity is provided for by the 2024 Law on cyber security. An updated list of critical and important information infrastructure operators was adopted by the government in July 2025.

Implementation and enforcement capacity

The general terrorism threat level in Albania is assessed as low. Law enforcement and justice institutions in charge of counterterrorism work professionally and effectively. Albania has made progress in implementing the 2023-2025 Strategy to prevent violent extremism and fight terrorism, but the government needs to allocate adequate resources to implement this strategy and its related action plan. The Albanian State Police referred at least six cases of criminal offences with terrorist intent to the Special Prosecutors Office and the district prosecution offices in 2024 and 2025. Investigative and prosecutorial capacities need to be enhanced, especially at local level.

The rehabilitation and reintegration of the 38 Albanian foreign terrorist fighters and family members, officially returned from Syria/Iraq through repatriation processes is being handled effectively. Authorities should allocate an adequate budget for this work in order to ensure sustainability in the medium and long term. The government is continuing its efforts to repatriate those who remain in the Al-Hol and Al-Roj camps in Syria. Possibly over 70 Albanian citizens are still remaining in the camps.

The local dimension of prevention of radicalisation and the national-local coordination has been reinforced by the creation of the regional security councils, presided by the prefects.

Online radicalisation, radicalisation in prisons and terrorist content online remain major challenges. Monitoring of online content poses difficulties as institutional capacities and resources are limited. Albania also needs to improve its ability to monitor and combat the financing of terrorism, implementing the existing legal framework and taking into account the impact of new technologies (e.g. cryptocurrencies).

![Image 27](blob:http://localhost/80744b0d2616a241d2b1d2d13551db54)Judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters

Judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters with EU Member States, the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) and Eurojust remains broadly satisfactory. In 2024, the EPPO sent three requests for mutual legal assistance to Albanian authorities. Albania was involved in 152 new cases at Eurojust related to organised crime, drug trafficking and money laundering, with a majority of them (89) opened at the request of the Liaison Prosecutor. The number of Eurojust supported joint investigation teams that Albania participated in is 25 for the period between 1 st March 2024 and 31 st July 2025. Most of the teams (16) continue to work in the field of narcotics.

![Image 28](blob:http://localhost/c049d029d4b4e00ead9002a697bc4fb2)The legal framework for judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters is partially aligned with the EU acquis to the extent that alignment is already possible. On 13 February 2025, Albania ratified the Hague Convention of 2 July 2019 on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments in Civil or Commercial Matters(the 2019 Judgments Convention) which will enter into force for Albania on 1 March 2026. The 2019 Judgments Convention, will strengthen cooperation between EU Member States and Albania, p rovide legal certainty and predictability to parties involved in cross-border transactions and will enhance access to justice.

Legal and irregular migration

The legal framework for migration is partially aligned with the EU acquis. Th e management of legal and irregular migration is broadly satisfactory.

Legal alignment, strategic and institutional frameworks

A revised Law on foreigners was adopted in June 2025. The implementation of a national migration strategy (2024-2030) adopted in May 2024 and its action plan (2024-2026) is currently being implemented. Continued coordination with all relevant services beyond the Ministry of Interior is needed. The strategy includes the main priorities and goals set out in the EU action plan on the Western Balkans presented by the Commission in December 2022, and is aligned with relevant national strategies and commitments made under the EU’s Global Alliance to Counter Migrant Smuggling.

Albania continues to take part in the Global Alliance to Counter Migrant Smuggling and is invited to renew its engagement at the occasion of the Global Alliance's second conference scheduled to take place at the end of 2025.

Albania obtained observer status in the European Migration Network in June 2025.

Implementation and enforcement capacity

Albania cooperated with the EU, its agencies and Member States in implementing the EU action plan on the Western Balkans, which helped further reduce the number of irregular migrants apprehended in Albania. Most irregular migrants were Syrians, Pakistani or Egyptians in 2024. A decreasing trend of irregular arrivals continued in 2025. The authorities’ regular and timely reporting on irregular migration flows and asylum continues.

![Image 29](blob:http://localhost/5d544b8581ef10c0c983b0583549e14e)Albania currently has enough reception capacity with around 600 beds, including 220 beds in the asylum reception centre in Babrru. The long-awaited work on setting up separate reception and accommodation facilities for unaccompanied minors has started. Unaccompanied children need to be included in an effective national child protection system, and pre-screening procedures for all migrants at all border crossings need to be standardised.

The work towards an updated national contingency plan for the possible arrival of a substantial number of migrants and asylum seekers accelerated in 2025, with the assistance of the EU Agency for Asylum and European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) as well as the International Organization for Migration and the United Nations Refugee Agency. The contingency plan still needs to be adopted along with a corresponding budget.

The ability of border officers to identify vulnerable applicants for international protection and migrants needs to improve, as does their coordination with child protection and anti-trafficking units. Albania should increase the ability to conduct returns of migrants with no legal rights to stay in the country and address shortcomings identified in its return mechanism.

Albania has a readmission agreement with the EU, which is functioning well, and implementing protocols, further facilitating its implementation, signed with 14 Member States. According to data provided by the Member States to EUROSTAT in 2024, 15 125 Albanian nationals were ordered to leave the EU, and 7 805 were effectively returned. The electronic readmission case management system (e-RCMS) with Belgium has been installed but has not yet been put into operation. Cooperation between Albania and Frontex on return operations is very good.

The reintegration of returnees, especially the most vulnerable, needs to improve.

The number of nationals from non-EU countries voluntarily returned from Albania to their countries of origin remained very low: 24 assisted voluntary returns were processed in 2024 compared with 9 in 2023 (and 6 in 2022). Albania needs to make progress in establishing practical cooperation on returns of non-EU nationals with the main countries of origin and to actively step up engagement with these countries.

Albania should ensure that legal pathways developed towards third country nationals prevent irregular secondary movements to the EU.

![Image 30](blob:http://localhost/b05ed01a826b2d0bfaed1b90f70a42ec)Asylum

The legal and institutional framework is in place, but asylum management needs to be improved in practice.

Institutional set-up and legal alignment

The Law on asylum is largely aligned with the EU acquis. Cooperation with the European Union Asylum Agency (EUAA) on its implementation continues under the second phase of the Albania-EUAA cooperation roadmap (2024-2027) endorsed in October 2024.

Albania has the required institutions in place to handle asylum claims. Asylum laws and its bylaws still need to be implemented effectively. This requires additional investment in administrative capacity and the development of a well-functioning asylum system.

Implementation and enforcement capacity

![Image 31](blob:http://localhost/8ce32eafe27a084258e08b5db26fc1f4)Albania remains primarily a transit country.T he number of asylum requests decreased in 2024 compared with 2023,i n line with a significant drop in arrivals. Out of all arriving migrants apprehended for the first time, 7.5% lodged an asylum request.

Challenges persist with the capacity of Border and Migration Police to identify and refer people who could be in need of international protection to the adequate services. The Directorate for Migration, Asylum, Anti-trafficking and Foreigners needs more technical capacity and human resources to assess asylum cases and make well-informed decisions.

Since 2018, Albania has granted refugee status to only one person. In 2024, 16 people were granted subsidiary protection.

Visa policy

Albania’s visa policy is still not fully aligned with the EU’s, in particular the list of countries whose nationals require an entry visa. Progress towards alignment is slow.

Albania still has a visa-free regime with eleven countries that are on the EU list of visa-required countries, of which six enjoy permanent visa exemption and five have a temporary visa waiver lasting from April to December (this latter practice is incompatible with the EU acquis). In April 2025, Albania removed Belarus from the list of countries benefiting from a permanent visa waiver (effective as of October 2025) and Bahrain from the list of countries benefiting from a temporary visa waiver., Albania committed to further alignment with the EU list of visa-required countries. In July 2025, Albania proposed a roadmap towards full alignment with the EU visa policy, with the envisaged deadlines for terminating each visa-free regime, both permanent and seasonal, which is a positive development

The Commission’s Seventh Report under the Visa Suspension Mechanism of 6 December 2024 concluded that Albania had taken action to address most of the previous recommendations. Albania is expected to continue actions to further reduce unfounded asylum applications by Albanian nationals to EU Member States, on top of ensuring full visa policy alignment with the EU and proceeding to more rigorous screening of non-EU nationals arriving visa free in Albania.

Schengen governance and external borders

The legislative and strategic framework for the management of external borders is partially aligned with the EU acquis.

The management of borders is broadly satisfactory. However, Albania is expected to advance the work towards the adoption of a Schengen Action Plan to establish a robust national Schengen governance system.

Legal alignment, strategic and institutional frameworks

The revised Law on border control was adopted in June 2025. Rules on advance passenger information (API) and passenger name records (PNR) are now part of a separate law also adopted in June 2025.

Implementation of the Schengen acquis needs to be further enhanced through the development of a Schengen governance system supported by a forward-looking Schengen Action Plan, which is under preparation. Albania has been invited to develop a comprehensive needs analysis to set up a national governance framework in preparation of adopting and implementing a Schengen Action Plan. This would ensure efficient and holistic implementation of its Schengen obligations, including as regards further investment in infrastructure, equipment, staffing, and training.

Implementation and enforcement capacity

The implementation of the updated Frontex Status Agreement of June 2024 is progressing well.

Implementation of the national integrated border management strategy 2021-2027 is ongoing. Border police staffing was significantly increased in 2024. In 2024, Albania carried out 1 063 joint patrols in line with respective protocols with Italy, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Kosovo[5](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025SC0750#footnote6)*, 6% fewer than in 2023.

Following formal approval of the establishment of the National Coordination Centre for Integrated Border Management in December 2024, Albania is encouraged to ensure that it is fully functioning as soon as possible. The total information management system (TIMS) still suffers from security and data protection vulnerabilities, which need to be urgently addressed.

Euro counterfeiting (criminal law aspect)

The corresponding legislation is broadly in line with the EU acquis on the suppression of counterfeit currency.

All aspects of customs cooperation are covered in Chapter 29 – Customs Union.

2.3. Economic criteria

![Image 32](blob:http://localhost/9a4ed4e23ac7b6d645b6d1147d1840a7)

2.3.1. The existence of a functioning market economy

Economic governance

The government remained committed to maintaining macroeconomic stability and boosting growth. In 2024, the fiscal outturn improved compared to previous years and outperformed budget targets, but this was partly the result of under-executed capital spending. The practice of amending the budget via normative acts rather than by using the regular legislative process continued (with three budget revisions in 2024 and two until July 2025). The Medium-Term Revenue Strategy (MTRS) 2024-2027, adopted by the Council of Ministers in December 2024, aims to increase public revenues (by ALL 64.8 billion or about 2.6% of 2024 GDP) mainly by improving tax and customs administration (85% of the expected revenue increase) rather than changing tax policies. Albania submitted its 2025-2027 Economic Reform Programme (ERP) to the European Commission on time in mid-January 2025. The ERP emphasised the government’s commitment to maintaining macroeconomic stability, achieving surpluses in the primary balance and abiding to the fiscal rules set out in the organic budget law. Albania also committed to socio-economic and fundamental reforms to accelerate growth and convergence with the EU.

The implementation of the policy guidance set out in the conclusions of the Economic and Financial Dialogue of May 2024 has been partial. Albania complied with the fiscal rules on the budget balance and on public debt and stepped up the pace of fiscal consolidation given better-than-expected economic and revenue performance. Arrears continued to build up throughout 2024 and, although the end-of-year target for their reduction was achieved, the reliance on ex post clearance through budget reallocations should gradually be phased out. Tax revenue as a share of GDP increased in 2024 and a stand-alone fiscal risk statement has been drafted but not published. The transparency and accountability of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) still needs to be improved. The authorities worked on the public-private partnerships (PPPs) law, but the draft law is pending parliamentary approval. PPPs are not yet integrated into the National Single Project Pipeline.

Macroeconomic stability

![Image 33](blob:http://localhost/f4ca97fb67e3b7071f77edc4b8183420)The economy maintained a strong growth momentum. Following 4% GDP growth in 2023, economic expansion remained strong at 4% in 2024, driven by robust domestic demand, good tourism performance and sustained construction activity. The rise in household consumption was supported by increasing real wages amid slowing inflation, and by stronger credit growth. Public consumption growth was elevated on the back of the second phase of the public wage reform. Job creation in the services sector supported employment growth. Exports of services expanded, but goods exports fell significantly due to the appreciation of the lek and an unfavourable external environment. Overall, the contribution of net exports to GDP growth was negative. M ost economic sectors recorded positive output growth, but agriculture and industry contracted. Economic activity continued to expand in 2025, with GDP registering an annual growth rate of 3.4% in the first quarter. Albania’s GDP per capita in purchasin g power standards stood at 37% of the EU-27 average in 2024 compared to 30% in 2019.

![Image 34](blob:http://localhost/b47d388a22da7b7570d855dfdbd8af43)The current account deficit remained moderate.It increased to 2.4% of GDP in 2024, following a historic low of 1.2% of GDP in 2023. The widening of the deficit in 2024 was primarily driven by a rise in the goods trade deficit, due to a decline in exports and a continued increase in imports driven by the rapid expansion of domestic demand. The services balance remained in robust surplus, driven by tourism. The surplus of the secondary income balance fell, with remittances declining from 4.3% of GDP in 2023 to 4.2% in 2024 (despite their nominal increase). The primary income balance was slightly negative at 0.8% of GDP. In the first quarter of 2025, the current account deficit narrowed, with its rolling 4-quarter total standing at 2.1% of GDP (mainly du e to an increase in exports of goods and services).Net foreign direct investments (FDI) inflows remained the primary source of financing the current account deficit in 2024. They grew by 7% year on year in 2024, but their share of GDP declined to 5.4%, from 5.8% one year earlier. The real estate sector remained the largest recipient of FDI flows. International reserves increased to EUR 6.2 billion in December 2024, covering seven months of imports of goods and services. The external debt-to-GDP ratio has been on a declining trend and fell by 0.7 pps to 46.8% in 2024.

Inflation fell below the 3% central bank target. Annual inflation averaged 2.2% in 2024, down from 4.8% in 2023 and a high of 6.7% in 2022. This steady disinflation has been driven by lower food and commodity prices and an appreciating domestic currency. Imported inflation reached historically low levels in 2024 amid exchange rate appreciation. On the other hand, domestic inflationary pressures have moderated more gradually amid strong demand and a tight labour market. Core inflation also fell in 2024. The Bank of Albania implemented two reductions in the key policy interest rate in 2024, lowering it from 3.25% to 2.75%, and a further cut in July 2025, to 2.5%. In the first two months of 2025, inflation recorded a slight decline to 1.9% and then picked up to 2.5% in July 2025.

![Image 35](blob:http://localhost/49f4c13401ca551fdf50b8be3d7453f3)Fiscal consolidation accelerated in 2024, but the budget deficit is set to increase markedly in 2025.The budget deficit fell from 1.3% of GDP in 2023 to 0.7% of GDP in 2024, significantly undershooting the deficit target of 2.3% of GDP. While revenues performed well, this fiscal outcome was partly the result of public investment under-execution. The primary balance surplus stood at 1.4% of GDP (up from 0.7% of GDP in 2023), supporting the decline in the public debt ratio, which fell by 3.4 pps to 54.2% of GDP in 2024.[6](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025SC0750#footnote7) However, gross financing needs remain elevated. The 2025 budget, adopted in December 2024, projects the deficit to increase to 2.6% of GDP. In the first eight months of 2025, the budget execution showed a fiscal surplus of 1.6% of GDP. Tax expenditures, estimated at 4-5% of GDP[7](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025SC0750#footnote8), and high levels of informality still constrain the revenue base.As part of the MTRS implementation, in June 2025 the government finalized a report on existing tax exemptions, but the assessment has not been made public and c oncrete proposals to eliminate those exemptions that are not well justified have not yet been developed.In 2025, Albania amended the i ncome t ax l aw and extended its significant tax incentives for luxury hotels[8](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025SC0750#footnote9), which goes against Albania’s commitment to reduce tax expenditures.A higher public-revenue-to-GDP ratio is crucial to sustain investments in both physical and human capital while firmly anchoring the downward trend in public debt.

The regulatory framework for public investment management (PIM) has been improved in recent years, but challenges remain. In February 2024, the government updated the PIM guidelines introducing clarifications, including on the role of the Ministry of Finance in certain situations, and that of the Agency for Strategic Planning (SASPAC). Changes to the legal framework were also made in March 2025, when the government approved amendments to the Decision of the Council of Ministers (DCM) No 887/2022 on PIM procedures, including quarterly updates to the National Single Project Pipeline (NSPP) and increased flexibility for feasibility studies. Yet, the planning and execution of public investment projects continues to face significant obstacles in the form of capacity constraints, incomplete project proposals, delays and cost overruns, and an occasional lack of adherence to procedures. The recurrent under-execution in capital spending is a clear indication that shortcomings exist in the operationalisation of the new legal framework and of the NSPP.

Albania implemented an overall appropriate macroeconomic policy mix. It helped sustain macroeconomic stability and supported economic growth. On the fiscal side, the budget deficit narrowed, the surplus in the primary balance increased while the public debt ratio continued its downward path. As disinflation accelerated, with inflation falling below the central bank target, monetary policy was eased. At the same time, bank supervision has been prudent, with the countercyclical capital buffer raised twice amid strong credit expansion.

Functioning of product markets

Business environment

The business environment remains challenging. Businesses welcome the fact that there has been some progress on the justice reform and anti-corruption matters, but lengthy court procedures persist (see Chapter 23 – Judiciary and Fundamental Rights). The business environment also remains affected by weaknesses in the rule of law, informality and limited access to finance for SMEs, particularly farmers. Bureaucracy and lengthy licensing procedures, combined with problems of consistency in case law, create burdens for businesses. Clear policies that encourage effective tax compliance and reduce tax evasion would help formalise more businesses and broaden the tax base. Granting of strategic investor status and PPP/concession contracts are often considered non-transparent by businesses. The country also struggles with incomplete and inconsistent property title registration, leading to uncertainty and disputes over ownership which deter investment. Although Albania has made efforts to modernise its property system through cadastre digitalisation, progress has been slow and uneven. Despite efforts towards deregulation and facilitation of business-related services, the responsiveness of public institutions to deliver efficient services is slow, while service delivery remains heavily centralised in Tirana, leaving rural regions underserved. The effectiveness of public consultation processes continues to show room for improvement.

State influence on product markets

The adoption of a unified investment law has been further postponed, while the Law on s trategic i nvestment has been extended until 2026. Work on establishing a harmonised legal framework for investments started years ago but progress has stalled. This initiative seeks to replace the existing Law on s trategic i nvestment, providing a more cohesive and transparent legal environment for both domestic and foreign investors[9](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025SC0750#footnote10). Meanwhile, in February 2025,P arliament amended the Law on s trategic i nvestment, extending its effects until 2026, and included in the strategic investor category investments worth EUR 50 million or more, irrespective of the sector,provided they received prior approval from the line Ministry. While these measures are designed to boost economic activity[10](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025SC0750#footnote11), they have also raised concerns about transparency and equitable access, favouritism and lack of competitive processes.

The Bank of Albania introduced an SME financing programme. In early 2025, in collaboration with the government, the central bank launched a financing scheme to improve credit access for SMEs, particularly in agriculture, which is a sector that accounts for only 2% of loans to businesses. The Bank of Albania aimed to finance the programme with EUR 250 million, offering loans through commercial banks. It also included a sovereign guarantee covering up to 70% of loan principals. Interest rates are capped at 3.5% or lowered to 2% if the sovereign guarantee applies. The deadline for applications is end of 2025.

Privatisation and restructuring

Regulation allowing for privatisation of public assets, land or movable assets, has been amended. Albania introduced several amendments to the regulation that provides for the privatisation of public assets. Under the revised rules, entities that have secured long-term lease contracts for public assets at symbolic rates (e.g. EUR 1) and used the state-owned assets/land for over a decade can purchase those assets under certain conditions. The implementation of this initiative should ensure equal treatment of investors. The government also adopted regulations to facilitate the transfer of public assets to the Albanian Investment Corporation for further development and revitalisation programmes in partnership with private investors. In March 2025, Parliament adopted the ‘Mountain package’ legislation. This initiative aims to stimulate economic growth in Albania’s mountainous regions by promoting investments in sectors like tourism and agriculture, by providing fiscal incentives and by offering some benefits on land acquisition for those investing in these areas. It is essential to safeguard Albania’s ecological and biodiversity values and ensuring full transparency throughout the process.

SOEs pose fiscal risks, and their governance still needs to be improved. SOEs, in particular the state-owned energy utilities, receive loans from the central government but repayment is unpredictable, while the financial viability of some of these companies is weak. Due to the risks posed to the budget, monitoring SOEs is crucial. The Fiscal Risk Unit of the Ministry of Finance expanded the number of monitored SOEs to 1 2. T echnical assistance is also ongoing to improve SOEs’ financial reporting practices and the monitoring of their financial performance.The publication of annual financial performance reports by SOEs should become standard practice, while strengthening SOEs oversight remains essential.Weak governance of SOEs contributes to market distortions and unfair competitive conditions[11](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025SC0750#footnote12). =.

Functioning of the financial market

The banking sector remained well-capitalised and profitable, while the non-performing loans ratio decreased. At aggregate level, banks had a capital adequacy ratio of 19.8% in December 2024, which is well above the Albanian minimum requirement of 12%. Following very good performance in 2023, banks’ profitability continued to improve in 2024, supported by increasing net interest income, higher income from fees and commissions, and the decrease in loan-loss provisions. The non-performing loans ratio stood at 4% in July 2025, down from 4.7% a year earlier. Driven by higher demand and favourable financing conditions, private sector credit accelerated in 2024. Nevertheless, the level of financial intermediation remained low – the share of private sector loans in GDP stood at 33% in the first half of 2025. The high share of government securities among banks’ assets continues to expose them to sovereign risk. Good progress has been made in collecting data on banks’ exposure to the real estate sector and in monitoring credit standards for real estate loans. The Bank of Albania took new borrower-based macroprudential measures to address potential risks in the real estate sector. It has also increased the countercyclical capital buffer to 0.5% (effective from December 2025). Efforts to strengthen oversight of non-bank financial institutions should continue.

In March 2025, the law establishing the Albanian Development Bank as a deposit-taking institution was adopted. The law raises major concerns regarding compliance with EU competition and State aid rules in the field of banking. The development bank must have an operational framework that mitigates moral hazards and fiscal risks from state guarantees, and complies with best practices in terms of governance as well as appropriate supervision and regulation applicable to other deposit-taking institutions, to ensure transparency, sound lending practices, adequate deposit protection and a level playing field in the banking sector.

Functioning of the labour market

The labour market registered positive developments, but it faces structural issues. Albania’s labour market exhibited notable improvements in 2024, with an increased employment rate (a 1.5 pps year-on-year increase to 68.3% in Q4-2024) and higher wages, alongside a decline in the unemployment rate (a 0.6 pps year-on-year drop to 9.6% in Q4-2024)[12](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025SC0750#footnote13). The youth unemployment rate also improved compared to one year earlier, falling from 21.2%to 19.1%, but it remains elevated. The Youth Guarantee Scheme piloting in three municipalities was extended until 2027. Informal employment remains an issue, with many workers lacking formal contracts, social security, and legal protections, while the underreporting of wages is widespread, eroding pensions. Emigration, especially of skilled workers, exacerbates labour shortages ![Image 36](blob:http://localhost/9774a2011bd7dc4ee1b590741610a87b)in key sectors, contributing to a brain drain. Insufficient active labour market policies hinder workforce adaptability and limit opportunities for higher-quality employment. The coverage of Albania’s social assistance system remains inadequate. The tripartite collaboration between the State Labour and Social Services Inspectorate, trade unions and employer organisations remains weak.Albania adopted in June 2025 a policy document on aging and an action plan for 2025-2030.

2.3.2. The capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the EU

Education and innovation

The education system faces challenges, hindering the build-up of a skilled and competitive workforce. Albania continued to implement the National Education Strategy 2021-2026, which aims to improve quality of education and access and adaptation to the labour market. Nevertheless, the education system is faced with low educational attainment and high dropout rates, particularly in rural areas and among marginalised communities. Albania’s not in education, employment, or training (NEET) rate for youth aged 15-29 stands at approximately 24% in 2023, significantly higher than the EU average. The quality of education is often hindered by outdated curricula, insufficient teacher training and outdated infrastructure. Furthermore, there is limited access to early childhood education. The education system also struggles with inclusivity, particularly for children with disabilities and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. The lack of effective vocational education and training (VET) hinders workforce adaptability and limits opportunities for higher-quality employment. Nevertheless, efforts were made to address some weaknesses, by updating curricula, introducing traineeship programmes, and piloting an apprenticeship programme (work-based learning) (See Chapter 26 – Education).

Public spending on research and development (R&D) is limited. Albania aims to spend 1% of GDP on R&D in 2030, but currently figures are way below the official target. In December 2024, Albania adopted the Strategy on Innovative Entrepreneurship. Besides increasing public R&D expenditure, further efforts are needed to incentivise businesses to increase their R&D expenditure and encourage cooperation between the private sector and universities.

Physical capital and quality of infrastructure

Transport infrastructure development is advancing. Albania continued its public investment in infrastructure, mainly roads, but also railways. Progress has been made on major highways such as the Adriatic-Ionian Highway and Corridor VIII, which are part of the trans-European transport network (TEN-T). The construction of the Tirana–Durrës railway and the railway connection to the airport is ongoing (approx. 80% complete), while the construction of the new airport in Vlora through a concessionary contract is in its final stage. According to the authorities, all transport infrastructure projects that are part of the TEN-T for all modes of transport are included in the Albanian NSPP. While infrastructure projects are advancing, gaps remain, and the recurrent issue of the under-execution of public investment is slowing down the build-up of the capital stock.

Investment in digital infrastructure advanced in 2024. Albania completed the authorisation process for 5G services, granting licences to two mobile operators The number of broadband subscribers grew by 10% compared to 2023, and the mobile broadband penetration rate increased by 15.4%. Several operators reportedly upgraded their networks to deliver faster internet services, primarily through advanced fibre-optic infrastructure capable of supporting high and very high-speed data transmission.

Steps have been taken to improve energy efficiency.In June 2025, Parliament approved a Law on energy performance of buildings. Albania also approved a long-term renovation strategy focusing on improving energy efficiency in buildings and decarbonising the energy sector, including also measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, integrate renewable energy and improve energy security (see Chapter 15 – Energy).

Sectoral a nd enterprise structure

The structure of the economy remains similar to the previous year. The structural survey of enterprises shows that, in 2023, micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises dominated Albania’s economy, comprising 99.9% of all enterprises. These businesses employed 82.5% of the total workforce and contributed 78.2% of the total value added by non-agricultural sectors. According to the 2023 data on the trade in goods by enterprise characteristics, SMEs accounted for 65% of total goods exports, marking a decline of 8.9% compared to 2022. The number of newly registered foreign companies (with 100% foreign ownership) reached 1 423 in 2024, reflecting an 11% increase compared to the previous year.

![Image 37](blob:http://localhost/59a5fce74352188e71b9483f37e0eb8f)![Image 38](blob:http://localhost/faf0c6265efca0d98aad15bf7f5584d3)Economic integration with the EU and price competitiveness

The EU remains Albania’s main trading and investment partner. Trade openness (the sum of total exports and imports as a share of GDP) declined from 82.4% in 2023 to 79.5% of GDP in 2024, as exports of goods fell. The EU remained Albania’s main trading partner. In 2024, the EU accounted for 57.4% of Albania’s goods trade, absorbing 71.7% of Albania’s merchandise exports and providing 51.5% of its goods imports. Italy (43.7%), Kosovo (9.9%), Greece (6.3%), and Germany (5.9%) were the leading export destinations. The country’s main import partners were Italy (21.1%), China (10.9%), Türkiye (10.8%) and Greece (7.6%). The EU also remains the main source of FDI inflows, while the EU’s share of FDI stocks stood at 54.1% (from 54.4% in 2023). Albania’s price competitiveness deteriorated, as reflected in the appreciation of the real effective exchange rate, the increase in nominal wages and lower goods exports. Manufacturing exports are sensitive to exchange rate appreciation, due to their low value added and businesses’ low pricing power. They are outweighed by services exports (in particular travel services, which more than doubled in value between 2019 and 2024), which provide some 80% of Albania’s total exports. SMEs accounted for 69% of total goods exports, marking a decrease of 10.3% compared to 2023.

2.4. Public procurement, statistics, financial control

Chapter 5: Public procurement

EU rules ensure that public procurement of goods, services and works in any Member State is transparent and open to all EU companies on the basis of non-discrimination and equal treatment.

Institutional set-up and legal alignment

The legal framework on public procurement is largely aligned with the 2014 EU Directive on public procurement and procurement of utilities. A number of implementing legislations were adopted in September 2024 to implement the amended Law on public procurement (PPL).

The transitional provision in the new PPL authorising central government institutions to negotiate and conclude international consultancy agreements in ‘areas of strategic interest’, thus exempting them from opening competition, continues to raise concerns over its compliance with the EU acquis and with the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.

The Law on concessions and public-private partnerships (PPPs) is partially aligned with the EU acquis. Work on a substantial revision of the PPP law with a view to aligning it with the EU acquis has not yet been concluded.

Implementation and enforcement capacity

Albania’s public procurement market represented 16.5% of GDP in 2024 (compared to 6.7% of GDP in 2023). The use of negotiated procedures without prior publication reduced in 2024, both in number of procedures (2.3% of all procedures from 2.9% in 2023) and in related value (0.4% of total value from 2% in 2023). There was a significant increase in new framework contracts; both in numbers (1 601 in 2024, from 767 in 2023) and in terms of value. This is attributed in part to the start of operations of the newly set-up Central Procurement Organisation.

The application of the most economically advantageous tender criteria (MEAT) for the award of public procurement contracts increased in 2024, both in terms of awarded tenders in which it was used (4.8% in 2024 compared with 3.6% in 2023,), and particularly in terms of value of associated contracts (41% in 2024 compared with 20.3% in 2023). PPA has issued new guidelines on the use of MEAT in September 2024 and has increased related training.

The use of new PPPs and concessions remains at very low levels. In 2024, only one procedure was launched and none was awarded.

The contracting authorities need to continue to build capacity to manage public procurement processes. Work has started on preparation of technical specifications for an upgrade of the electronic procurement system. Ongoing training continued with 3 139 (247 in 2023) participants being registered from 443 (98 in 2023) central, local and independent institutions and private entities in 2024.

On prevention of corruption in public procurement, Albania should focus on further strengthening the functioning of the overall system to increase competition, compliance and professionalisation.

Efficient remedy system

The constitution and the PPL contain provisions on the right to legal remedy that are mostly in line with the directives on remedies. The implementation capacity of the State Appeal Commission (SAC) needs to be further strengthened in view of the significant number of appeals it receives (1 151 in 2024, 1 019 in 2023). In 2024, the Public Procurement Commission (PPC) made 1050 decisions, 42 of which were challenged in court.

Chapter 18: Statistics

European statistics are developed, produced and disseminated by EU Member States, guided by the principles and quality criteria set out in the Regulation on European statistics, such as professional independence, impartiality, reliability, accessibility and statistical confidentiality. Common rules are provided for the methodology, production and dissemination of statistical information, which are further specified in sectoral legislation that constitute the EU acquis on statistics.

On the statistical infrastructure, Albania’s legislation is in line with European standards and respects the principles of European Statistics Code of Practice, and most classifications are in line with EU standards. Staff posts increased to 260 (+24) and recruitment is ongoing, but INSTAT continues to face capacity constraints and staff turnover. INSTAT needs to continue investing in its IT infrastructure, particularly on cybersecurity.

On macroeconomic statistics,Albania completed its benchmark revision of annual and quarterly national accounts from 1995, and revised government finance statistics (GFS) for the time series 2010-2023. Further progress is needed to compile and transmit data fully consistent with ESA 2010. Further efforts are in particular needed to compile and transmit excessive deficit procedure (EDP) and GFS data consistent with ESA 2010 and to address observed anomalies in reported data. In addition, the labelling of GFS data submitted to Eurostat as “non publishable” continues to raise strong concerns on transparency.Data gaps remain in the areas of statistics of R&D, international trade in goods, foreign direct investment and the international investment position.

On business statistics, short-term statistics are produced but some data sets are still not transmitted to Eurostat.

On social statistics, final census results at different territorial levels were released in 2024. Thematic analysis of census data should continue. The 2021 EU-Labour Force Survey methodology needs to be implemented and regular data transmission to Eurostat restored. Crime statistics are published yearly.

Agricultural statistics are partly aligned with the EU acquis. The agricultural census has been postponed to 2026 and work should continue to update work plan and budget, ensure the adoption of the agricultural census law, finalise the questionnaire and ensure the census logistics organised.

Environmental statistics are partly aligned with the EU acquis. Despite some improvements in the area further efforts are needed to comply with the EU acquis. Albania needs to start the compilation of Environmental Goods and Services Sector Accounts and Environmental Protection Expenditure Accounts. Energy statistics are partly aligned, and further work is required to reach full alignment with the EU acquis. Significant efforts should be made on transport statistics, including the organisation of the full scale survey on road freight transport in 2026.

Chapter 32: Financial control

The EU promotes the reform of national governance systems to improve managerial accountability, sound financial management of income and expenditure, and external audit of public funds. The financial control rules further protect the EU’s financial interests against fraud in the management of EU funds and the euro against counterfeiting.

Public internal financial control (PIFC)

A specific strategic framework for PIFC is in place. PIFC reports continued to be prepared annually. The internal control system remains partially effective and f urther efforts remain needed to advance the implementation of PIFC reforms. Risk management remains at an early stage.

Managerial accountability is embodied in the legislation. However, the number of administrative decisions delegated to lower levels remains very limited in practice.

The legislative framework on internal audit is in line with international standards. The implementation of the new system for the advanced certification of auditors continued. In 2024, the Central Harmonisation Unit assessed compliance with manuals and instructions of the internal audit activities of 20 internal audit units. It found that 37%, were partially or fully compliant, similar as in 2023.

External audit

Albania’s legal framework safeguards the independence of the State Audit Institution. The institutional capacity of the State Audit Institution stood at 216 staff out of a foreseen 243, broadly similar as in 2023. The quality of audit work continued to comply with the standards of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI). The impact of audit work progressed. 99% of recommendations issued in 2024 audits were accepted, of which 47% were fully or partially implemented. Albania should improve implementation of external audit recommendations. The parliamentary subcommittee on audit has held several hearings during the reporting period and issued resolutions in relation to a number of audits by the Albanian Supreme Audit Institution (ALSAI), which is a positive trend.

Protection of the EU’s financial interests

Albania has some level of alignment with the EU acquis in the area. However, full harmonisation of its legislation with the EU Directive on the fight against fraud to the EU’s financial interests by means of criminal law remains needed. A national anti-fraud strategy was adopted in May 2025. The national anti-fraud coordination service network met regularly. Yet, there is the need to clarify the role of the authorities of the anti-fraud coordination service (AFCOS) network in relation to protecting EU’s financial interests.

Further efforts remain needed by Albania to develop a solid track record on cooperation with the European Commission on investigations and on reporting of irregularities as well as effective operational assistance to the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). In 2024, Albania reported 60 cases of irregularities via the Irregularity Management System.

Protection of the euro against counterfeiting

No developments were reported regarding alignment with the EU acquis on the definition of counterfeit banknotes and coins on the procedures for gathering, storing and withdrawing them from circulation. In 2024, Albania withdrew from circulation 573 euro coins and 214 euro banknotes, representing 82% of all seized counterfeit currencies.

3. Good neighbourly relations and regional cooperation

Good neighbourly relations and regional cooperation form an essential part of Albania’s European integration process. They contribute to stability, reconciliation and a climate conducive to addressing open bilateral issues and the legacies of the past.

Albania continued to actively engage in a number of regional cooperation initiatives, such as the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), the Energy Community, the Transport Community, the South-East European Cooperation Process (SEECP) and the Regional Cooperation Council (RCC). Albania held the chairmanship-in-office of the SEECP in 2024-2025, which concluded with a Summit in Tirana on 16 June 2025. Albanian customs chaired the CEFTA sub-committee on customs and rules and organised in June in Tirana the Second High-Level Conference of Customs Directors General of the Western Balkans and EU Member States reaffirming the commitment to Deeper Economic Integration and Customs Cooperation.

Albania has actively engaged in the regional dimension of the Growth Plan for the Western Balkans, participating in both ministerial and leaders’ meetings, and hosted the February leaders’ meeting in Tirana. The hosting of the European Political Community Summit on 16 May 2025 was a further sign of Albania’s commitment to regional cooperation.

On the Common Regional Market (CRM) at the Berlin process summit in London in October 2025, the leaders of the region endorsed a revised and streamlined action plan to implement the Green Agenda for the Western Balkans, adopted a Western Balkans Climate Adaptation Roadmap and committed to make progress in the promotion of regional mobility and implementation of relevant regional agreements and CEFTA decisions. Albania signed the fifth mobility agreement on access to higher education and admission to studies in the Western Balkans and adopted the CRM action plan 2025-2028. Albania has ratified all five regional mobility agreements. The roadmap for roaming between the Western Balkans and the EU entered the first phase of implementation. Twelve major decisions were agreed by the CEFTA Joint Committee in October 2024, following an agreement between CEFTA members that allowed decision making in the organisation to be unblocked. A decision was finally taken on the appointment of a director for CEFTA after the post had been vacant for two and a half years. This had a significant negative impact of the work of CEFTA and, for a short period, saw the Commission suspend its support.

Albania generally maintains good bilateral relations with other enlargement countries and neighbouring EU Member States.

Relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina were upgraded after Albania opened an embassy in Sarajevo in May 2025, and the two countries’ representatives continue to make high-level visits.

Albania’s relations with Kosovo remained good. In December 2024, the parliaments of Albania and Kosovo held a joint plenary session in Pristina, with the participation of the two Prime Ministers. The two parliaments adopted a joint declaration pledging, among other things, to coordinate their national agendas with the goals of Albania’s EU accession and demanded serious engagement to advance Kosovo-Serbia dialogue in close cooperation with the EU and the US. In March 2025, Albania signed a joint declaration on defence cooperation with Kosovo and Croatia.

Relations with Montenegro remained good. High-level and political contacts continued.

Relations with North Macedonia remained good. Several bilateral agreements are in place on joint cooperation in a number of areas, including security, defence, infrastructure, energy, education, science and culture.

Relations with Serbia remained good overall, with regular high-level political contacts.

Relations with Türkiye were further strengthened with a visit of the Turkish President to the country in October 2024. During this visit, a joint declaration on deepening the strategic partnership was signed. Türkiye provided regular support to modernise the Albanian armed forces including donations in military drones. In July 2025, Albania and Türkiye signed a new protocol on defence cooperation, enhancing the existing cooperation framework Türkiye continued to put pressure on Albania to deliver on dismantling the ‘Gülen’ movement in the country. During his visit to Albania, the Turkish President inaugurated the Namazgah mosque in central Tirana, which is now the largest mosque in the Balkan region. A delegation from Türkiye’s Grand National Assembly’s Foreign Affairs Committee visited Albania.

Relations with Georgia remained good. Bilateral relations are active in international fora. Albania supports Georgia’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.

Relations with the Republic of Moldova remained good. In May 2025 Albania and Moldova signed a Memorandum of Understanding to enhance cooperation on EU accession.

Relations with Ukraine further intensified in the reporting period, with the opening of the Albanian Embassy in Kyiv at the end of 2024. In September 2024, Albania signed the Joint Declaration of Support for the Recovery and Reconstruction of Ukraine along with 30 other countries. A bilateral agreement on security cooperation and long-term support was signed in January 2025. Albania participated in the Ukraine–Southeast Europe Foreign Ministers’ meeting which took place in Kyiv in January 2025 and in the Ukraine–Southeast Europe Summit which took place in Odesa in June 2025. Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine who also serves as Minister of Justice and Chief Negotiator visited Tirana in July 2025. In January 2025, Albania and Ukraine signed a Memorandum of Understanding to strengthen cooperation in their EU accession processes.

Relations with Greece remained good overall, and political contacts continued.

Relations with Italy remained very good, as also reflected in the exchange of high-level visits.In September 2024, the two countries signed a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding between the respective national cybersecurity agencies. During the reporting period, implementation of the protocol on migration cooperation between Italy and Albania of November 2023 continued. Four operations to transfer migrants to Italian centres in Albania were carried out. These were legally challenged by the competent Italian judicial authorities.

4. Ability to assume the obligations of membership

Cluster 2: Internal market

This cluster covers: free movement of goods (Chapter 1); freedom of movement for workers (Chapter 2); right of establishment and freedom to provide services (Chapter 3); free movement of capital (Chapter 4); company law (Chapter 6); intellectual property law (Chapter 7); competition policy (Chapter 8); financial services (Chapter 9) and consumer and health protection (Chapter 28). This cluster is key to Albania’s preparations for the requirements of the EU’s internal market and is very relevant for the development of the Common Regional Market.

Chapter 1: Free movement of goods

The free movement of goods ensures that many products can be traded freely across the EU based on common rules and procedures. Where products are governed by national rules, the principle of the free movement of goods prevents these rules from creating unjustified barriers to trade.

General principles

Albania has a national roadmap for alignment of acquis in the area of free movement of goods, with an Action Plan for legal alignment and capacity building in the medium term (2023-2025) and the long term (2026-2030) and should increase the pace of its alignment to the acquis in this chapter.

Non-harmonised area

Albania has extended the scope of its ongoing work on drafting an Action Plan for screening national technical regulations to comply with Articles 34-36 of the TFEU in the non-harmonised area.

Harmonised area: quality infrastructure

In January 2025, further staff were recruited to the ministry responsible (Ministry of Economy, Culture and Innovation (MECI)). Market surveillance needs to be reinforced. From September 2024 to July 2025, 1 295 market surveillance inspections were carried out, resulting in 26 warnings, 15 fines, and one emergency measure.

Albania’s legislation on accreditation, on market surveillance and on conformity assessment remains partially aligned with the EU acquis. It has a high level of alignment in regard to standardisation. Albania’s General Directorate of Standardisation continues to address the issues identified by the peer review of the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (CENELEC) following its application to become a full member of CEN/CENELEC. National standards are adopted in line with EU standards. There are now 115 conformity assessment bodies in Albania that have been accredited by Directorate of Accreditation (DPA), compared with 118 in 2024, including 56 testing laboratories, one calibration laboratory, and 24 inspection bodies. The General Directorate of Metrology is fully staffed and operational. Albania has not prepared its legislation to be aligned with the EU requirements on notification of national legislation.

Harmonised area: sectoral legislation

In the area of ‘new and global approach’ product legislation, there were no developments on alignment with the EU acquis.

On ‘old approach’ product legislation, there were no developments on alignment with the EU acquis, including on registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (REACH); on chemical classification, labelling and packaging, on motor vehicles, on aerosol dispensers, and on detergents. Albanian legislation remains partly aligned on drug precursors, though the list of controlled substances already complies with the relevant lists in the EU acquis.

On procedural measures, there were no developments on alignment with the EU acquis, including on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of an EU Member State.

Albania has anti-corruption measures in place on transparency on accreditation, conformity assessment, tariffs, legal acts and the activities of public bodies. Some agencies and the customs administration that perform market surveillance have rules on transparency, ethics and conflicts of interest, and are subject to audits. However, more efforts are needed in terms of enforcement.

Chapter 2: Freedom of movement of workers

Citizens of one Member State have the right to work in another Member State and must be given the same working and social conditions as other workers.

On access to the labour market, in the period January-December 2024, 1 314 EU citizens benefited from the simplified procedure. Employment in civil service positions and in the state police require Albanian citizenship.

A national migration strategy for 2024-2030 is in place, accompanied by an action plan 2024-2026. In 2024, Albania issued a total of 11 224 work permits, 1 314 among those were granted to EU citizens. In preparation for joining the European network of employment services (EURES), Albania has put in place an integrated database for its employment services that, upon its connection to EURES, can facilitate exchanges of information between IT departments on civil status, the tax system, the compulsory healthcare system and the economic assistance system. The National List of Occupations has been aligned with the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications, and Occupations (ESCO) multilingual classification allowing for database transfer and connection with EURES and the ESCO classification has been implemented in the IT systems of the Albanian employment service.Early alignment with EURES would help Albania build the necessary infrastructure and expertise to support labour mobility.

On the coordination of social security systems, Albania Belgium, Luxembourg, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania)Social insurance agreements are in place with Italy (effective as of June 2025) and Montenegro (effective as of July 2025).

Bilateral agreements with Bulgaria, Croatia and Montenegro ratified by Albania in the previous reporting period are yet to enter into force. The agreements with Serbia and Poland have been finalised and are ready for signature and ratification in Parliament.

Albania still has no unified system for data exchange, and no progress was made regarding the creation of an electronic system for data exchange with the European Union countries. Progress on digitalisation process on future participation in the Electronic Exchange of Social Security Information (EESI) was reported. However, no progress was made on the European Health Insurance Card over the reporting period.

Chapter 3: Right of establishment and freedom to provide services

EU natural and legal persons have the right to establish themselves in any Member State and to provide cross-border services. For certain regulated professions, there are rules on mutual recognition of qualifications. EU rules on postal services focus on improving the quality of universal service, gradual market opening to competition, and the establishment of an independent regulator.

On the right of establishment and freedom to provide cross-border services, Albania has in place the National Business Centre, which functions as a one-stop-shop for registering businesses and issuing licences, authorisations, and permits. E-Albania portal serves as a single point of contact for accessing electronic services, enables interactions with several databases, and provides for pre-filled applications forms. The preparatory work to amend the Law on services with the EU Service Directive has continued. This includes adopting the regulatory Impact Assessment, drafting the law, consulting stakeholders and adopting a services action plan to harmonise Albanian legislation with sectoral directives.

In the area of postal services, Albanian legislation is aligned with the EU acquis. The implementation of the 2021-2026 Postal Strategy for the development of the postal sector is ongoing. There is currently one universal service provider (Albanian Post SA) designated until 2025, and 23 other postal service providers on the market. The Electronic and Postal Communications Authority (AKEP) is the independent national regulatory authority, re-affirmed in the 2024 Law on Electronic Communications, which entered into force in December 2024.

No progress was made in the area of mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Albania needs to intensify efforts to align its regulatory framework with the Professional Qualification Directive (PQD). In February 2025, Albania adopted the CEFTA decision related to the establishment of a general system of recognition of professional qualifications. Work on the action plan to align the legislation with the PQD on transparency and proportionality review is ongoing.

Chapter 4: Free movement of capital

In the EU, capital and investments must be able to move without restriction, with common rules for cross-border payments. Banks and other economic operators apply certain rules to support the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing.

On capital movements and payments, Albania has still not met its obligation under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement enabling EU nationals and entities to acquire agricultural land. As part of accession negotiations, Albania has requested a transitional period of seven years from the time of EU accession for implementing this obligation. During the reporting period, the Council of Ministers has amended the regulation that allows for privatisation of public assets (land or movable assets), including those investors who have acquired long-term contracts of leasing public assets at EUR 1. This can raise concerns about the fair price of sale for privatised assets.

On payment systems, the first transactions between Payment Initiation Service providers and banks occurred during the first quarter of 2025, as part of the operationalisation of open banking. Electronic payments have increased by 24% annually in the first half of 2025, boosted by the increase of online payments and card payments. The completion of the necessary alignment with the EU acquis enabled Albania to join the geographical scope of the SEPA schemes in November 2024. In January 2025, the Bank of Albania (BoA) initiated the development of a ‘clone’ of the TARGET Instant Payment System. The BoA has been working on introducing ISO 20022 and SEPA standards for the domestic market, and enhancing the efficiency of electronic payments. In September, the BoA introduced amendments to regulations of the payment systems: AIPS, AIPS EURO and AECH, as well as the SWIFT system functioning,reducing considerably payment costs for citizens and businesses, thereby encouraging the use of electronic channels.

On the fight against money laundering and terrorism financing, Albania continued to implement the FATF recommendations through Moneyval. Albania started the work on completing the Moneyval-FATF questionnaire for Albania’s sixth-round assessment, which is to be discussed by the Moneyval Committee in 2026. Efforts continued by Albania to align the legislation with the fourth and fifth anti-money laundering (AML) Directives, by approving two acts of secondary legislation designated to subjects involved in financial activities and non-financial businesses and professions. Furthermore, the BoA adopted the regulation on information accompanying transfer of funds, and set up a dedicated office on AML and Countering Financing of Terrorism (CFT) risk monitoring. In September, the BoA adopted the regulation on the licensing, organization, activity and supervision of foreign exchange bureaus, in compliance with international standards and Moneyval recommendations on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism. SEPA debit and credit schemes became operational on 7 October.

Albania continued to implement the Strategy on prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing 2024-2030, and the action plan of the national risk assessment 2024-2026. Inter- institutional technical working group monitoring meetings were held regularly. Albania has legislation in place on risk management and licensing requirements for financial institutions, including non-bank financial institutions and foreign exchange offices, in line with Moneyval recommendations. The register of beneficial owners is operational. The Albanian Financial Intelligence Unit (AFIU) continued to strengthen its capacities through internal trainings. Between September 2024 and July 2025 there were 1 537 suspicious activity reports, and 209 were referred from the AFIU to the Law enforcement agencies. In annual terms, the total number of suspicious transactions reports submitted to the AFIU in 2024 was 1 632 or 5% lower than the previous year, and the number of cases reported to law enforcement agencies was 234 or 6% higher as compared to the previous year. The AFIU carried out 70 inspections of the reporting entities, focusing on compliance review with the AML/CFT law. During 2024, the BoA inspected 50 foreign exchange offices, focusing on the fulfilment of anti-money laundering legislation requirements. These led to 15 fines and eight warning notices, and the revocation of licences to 14 FEOs. Reports by real-estate agencies to the AFIU has seen an increase in 2024 (5 cases) as compared to 2023 (1 case) although more efforts remain needed. The Public Oversight Body has put in place a risk-based approach for AML/CFT supervision, as part of the quality control process of statutory auditors and certified accountants’ compliance inspections.

Chapter 6: Company law

The EU has common rules on the formation, registration and disclosure requirements of a company, with complementary rules for accounting and financial reporting, and statutory audit.

Although there is some alignment with the EU acquis in a range of company law and corporate governance areas, there was no legislative progress during the reporting period. In February 2025, Albania adopted the Regulatory Impact Assessment on approximation of legislation with the EU Codification Directive. Further alignment is needed with the Directive on the use of digital tools and the Directive on cross-border mergers, divisions and conversions, as well as with rules on encouraging long-term shareholder engagement (Shareholder Rights Directive II) and with some aspects related to takeover bids. A corporate governance code for listed companies still needs to be developed in line with the OECD principles.

In the area of company reporting, the Law on accounting and financial statements is partially aligned with the EU 2013 Accounting Directive with progress to be made as regards application to SMEs and public-interest entities, as well as on country-by-country reporting. In addition, Albania should continue aligning with Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and the Non-Financial Reporting Directive, bearing in mind ongoing developments in the EU acquis. On statutory audit,in December 2024 Albania adopted the amended Law on auditing, organisation of the profession of the auditor and of the certified accountant, aiming further alignment with the relevant EU directives to ensure stronger oversight, enhanced auditor independence, increased quality assurance, and increased transparency and level of compliance with international standards. Albania should strengthen the capacity of the Public Audit Oversight Board and further align its framework with EU statutory audit rules.

Chapter 7: Intellectual property law

The EU has to a large extent harmonised rules for the legal protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR), covering notably patents, biotechnological inventions and pharmaceuticals, including supplementary protection certificates (SPCs), trademarks, designs, geographical indications (GIs), including craft and industrial GIs, as well as copyright and related rights.

In the area of copyright and related rights, a new law has been developed and is currently undergoing review.

Four Collective Management Organisations (CMOs) were licenced in September 2024 and together form a one-stop-shop. The methodology on the collection of remuneration on the uses of works protected by copyrights and related rights was finalised and is in force.

On industrial property rights, the laws on trademarks and patents were adopted in July 2025 to align with the EU acquis in these areas. In 2024, the sector of patents and utility models had 742 patent applications, of which 12 were national patent applications with Albanian applicants and 730 were issued by the European Patent Office seeking protection in Albania. In the same period, 4 252 applications for trademarks were filed: 1 575 national applications and 2 677 international applications.

The State Inspectorate for Market Surveillance (SIMS) is responsible for monitoring the enforcement of intellectual property rights. In 2024, the copyright division of SIMS carried out 342 inspections, resulting in 40 administrative sanctions. The industrial property division carried out 407 inspections, resulting in 12 administrative sanctions.

Chapter 8: Competition policy

EU rules protect free competition. They include antitrust rules against restrictive agreements between companies and abuse of a dominant position, and also include rules on concentrations between companies which would significantly impede effective competition. EU rules also set out a system of State aid control. Governments are only allowed to grant State aid if restrictive conditions are met, with a view to preventing distortion of competition.

Antitrust and mergers

Albania’s legislative framework is broadly in line with the EU acquis and the SAA.

In September 2024, to further align its secondary legislation with the EU acquis, the Competition Commission approved the guidelines on the referral of cases related to concentrations. The institutional framework is based on the Albanian Competition Authority (ACA), which is an operationally independent authority. It reports to Parliament and enjoys adequate prerogatives. On enforcement capacity, the ACA has maintained the total number of staff at 46. On implementation, between September 2024 and September 2025, the ACA issued 100 decisions, including four on prohibited agreements, 15 on abuse of a dominant position and 58 authorising concentrations. The ACA has carried out preliminary and in-depth investigation procedures, resulting in significant fines to companies operating in key economic sectors in Albania including construction and agri-business. The ACA should continue to raise awareness and strengthen enforcement of competition rules.

State aid

On the legislative framework, the framework Law on State aid largely reflects Articles 107 and 108 TFEU but the implementing legislation remains partly aligned with the EU acquis only in some areas, such as the General Block Exemption Regulation.

On the institutional framework, the State Aid Commission (SAC) is responsible for implementing the Law on State aid. Its operational independence, which is required by the SAA, has yet to be guaranteed, given that it is an arm of the Ministry of Finance and Economy. In this respect, a policy impact assessment (PIA) was finalised and will serve as a technical blueprint, offering options for ensuring the operational independence of SAC.

The SAC’s enforcement capacity remains insufficient as the staffing of its secretariat needs to be significantly increased. On implementation, in the reporting period, the SAC approved four decisions on the authorisation of State aid including the support to innovative start-ups and SMEs focusing on green and digital transition. The SAC can issue decisions on illegal and incompatible aid and order recovery but has not done so to date. The enforcement track record on State aid control needs to be significantly improved. Advocacy activities among grantors need to be stepped up to ensure prior notification of aid measures.

Liberalisation

The Law on State aid applies to all legal and natural persons performing an economic activity. There has been no investigation of State aid for public undertakings or undertakings with special or exclusive rights.

Chapter 9: Financial services

EU rules aim at ensuring fair competition among financial institutions and the stability and integrity of financial markets, namely in the fields of banking, insurance, supplementary pensions, investment services and securities. They include rules on authorisation, operation and supervision of these institutions.

In the area of banking and financial conglomerates, technical work continued on further alignment with the Capital Requirements Regulation and the Capital Requirements Directive. Work on drafting the Law on financial conglomerates in alignment with the relevant acquis has continued and consultation with stakeholders is expected within 2025. The BoA completed its first step-questionnaire in February 2025 for the technical advice to the Commission on the equivalence assessment performed by the European Banking Authority and has moved to the second-step questionnaire. In November 2024, the BoA amended the legislation on reporting according to the Unified Reporting System, presenting new reporting templates and requirements related to early warning indicators and the operational risk events register. It adopted also new requirements to reporting entities on providing quarterly reporting on the structure of direct and indirect capital shareholders/partners. The Albanian Deposit Insurance Agency has continued to work on amending the existing Law ‘On deposit insurance’ to align it with the EU acquis. There were no developments on further alignment with the EU banks recovery and resolution framework. Thus, the reform effort to align with the EU acquis should be increased.

In December 2024, the BoA communicated to the banks the intermediate minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) requirement, to be met during 2025 and completed and updated the resolution plans for the 11 banks operating in Albania. In February 2025, the BoA decided to maintain unchanged the policy on Resolution Fund during the year. The BoA monitors the performance of financial assets of the Resolution Fund each quarter through the Albanian Deposit Insurance Agency. The overall 2027 target of funding level for the Resolution Fund is 0.5% of total liabilities of the banking sector (not aligned yet with BRRD, according to which the target level of the resolution fund should be 1% of covered deposits).

Albania adopted in March 2025 the Law on establishment of the National Development Bank through which deposit collection will not be handled by the Bank but by an entity of the Postal Service without licensing requirements. The supervision/relationship between this entity, the National Development Bank and the Central Bank, should be defined without delay.

On the financial market infrastructure Albania remains partially aligned with financial markets infrastructure legislation. No particular progress has been made during the reporting period in this area which requires immediate attention.

In the area of insurance and occupational pensions, the Albanian Financial Supervisory Authority (AFSA) has launched an indicative roadmap for alignment of legislation with Solvency II Directive. Amendments to the Law on the activity of insurance and reinsurance, were adopted in December 2024 and sent for approval to Parliament, aiming further alignment with Solvency II Directive, and the Insurance Distribution Directive. Efforts to implement these amendments must be intensified. In 2025 AFSA board adopted the regulation on setting risk factors when calculating compulsory insurance premiums for transport sector and one setting the supervisory rules on life insurance activities related to participation in collective investment undertakings with public offering.

On investment funds,Albania has started preparations for drafting a regulation on Investor compensation scheme following an assessment of EU best practices.

On sustainable and digital finance,in January 2025 the BoA signed with the European Investment Bank, a cooperation agreement aimed at developing green finance, including development of Green Taxonomy. The BoA has worked on climate risk stress-testing methodologies to evaluate potential risks from climate-related financial shocks and is closely monitoring how climate risks impact financial and economic stability. In November 2024 the BoA adopted a regulation on operational risk management by banks, payment institutions and electronic money institutions, to address the operational, cyber and ICT risk. During the reporting period, the AFSA has conducted a comparative analysis of the current legislation with the Market in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) and in July an inter-institutional working group to align with the EU acquis was set up. The BoA and the AFSA have started the work on drafting relevant regulations on digital operational resilience that would align it with requirements of EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).

Chapter 28: Consumer and health protection

EU rules protect consumers’ economic interests and also ensure product safety, prevent dangerous imitations and establish liability for defective products. The EU also guarantees a high level of protection of public health and in particular also ensures high common standards for tobacco control, blood, tissues, cells and organs, and human and veterinary medicinal products. The EU also has rules for upholding patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare and in preparing for and responding to serious cross-border health threats, including communicable diseases.

Consumer protection

On horizontal aspects, Albania has a 2023–2030 cross-cutting Strategy on consumer protection and market surveillance in place. In the reporting period, the Consumer Protection Consumption body (CPC) has received complaints, however, information was not available on how the CPC dealt with these complaints. There have not been any developments on enforcement and redress. On product safety, Albania is yet to align with the new EU acquis on General Product Safety. Albania is only partly aligned on product liability and on consumer protection. (For information on market surveillance, see Chapter 1 – Free movement of goods).

Public health

In 2024 public health expenditure was around 2.8% of GDP. General government expenditure on health remains under 10% of total government expenditure, though absolute terms it increased, compared with 2030 target of 2030. Albania has the highest rate out-of-pocket healthcare expenses in Europe, with citizens paying 59.7% of total health costs. Albania’s demographic shift is towards an ageing population, driven by lower fertility rates, increased life expectancy, and emigration. On eHealth, an electronic system for collecting and reporting health information of medical records (HIS) has been set up.

National legislation on substances of human origin is designed to align with the EU acquis. There was no progress on alignment on human and veterinary medicinal products on medical devices, on health technology assessment, or on patient’s rights in cross-border healthcare, which all remain partly aligned with the EU acquis, or on cosmetics. There has been no progress in the reporting period on antimicrobial resistance (AMR). On tobacco control, Albania still needs to accede to the World Health Organisation’s framework Convention Protocol to eliminate the illicit trade in tobacco products, and to further align with the rest of the EU tobacco control acquis (See also Chapter 16 – Taxation). The ban on smoking in indoor public areas is insufficiently and unequally enforced.

There have been no developments on communicable diseases or on serious cross-border health threats, which remain partly aligned with the EU acquis, and the foreseen new epidemic and pandemic preparedness plan is yet to be adopted, and the country is yet to update ECDC on this. Albania needs to fight disinformation on vaccines. Albania still needs to develop a Health Security Action Plan, but it has strengthened its emergency preparedness. There were also no developments on reduction of harmful use of alcohol, or on drug abuse and prevention, where prevention activities remain sporadic. A national cancer control plan is in place, and three cancer screening programmes are ongoing. Screening programmes are ongoing on colorectal, breast, and cervical cancers. A cancer registry is yet to be created. On mental health, a 2023 – 2026 Mental Health Action Plan is in place. Albania needs to broaden the range of community services for mental health. Malnutrition remains a critical issue, while obesity in children and anaemia in pregnant women remain concerning.

On health inequalities, though the 2021-2025 national action plan for the Equality, Inclusion and Participation of Roma aims at enhancing Roma access to quality health and preventive services, weaknesses in its implementation remain. There have been no new developments on access to health for women, including on sexual and reproductive health.

On anti-corruption, market surveillance bodies have rules on transparency, ethics and conflicts of interest and are subject to audits. On public health there are anti-corruption measures in place on cosmetics, control systems on control pharmaceutical manufacturers and to track veterinary medicine stocks. The health sector was identified as a vulnerable sector in the draft National Anti-Corruption Strategy 2024-2030; however, a comprehensive risk assessment of the sector and development of specific measures is yet to be ensured.

Cluster 3: Competitiveness and inclusive growth

This cluster covers: digital transformation and media (Chapter 10); taxation (Chapter 16); economic and monetary policy (Chapter 17); social policy and employment (Chapter 19); industrial policy (Chapter 20); science and research (Chapter 25); education and culture (Chapter 26); and customs union (Chapter 29).

Chapter 10: Digital transformation and media

The EU supports the smooth functioning of the internal market for electronic communications, electronic commerce and audiovisual services. The rules protect consumers and support the universal availability of modern services.

On electronic communications, no progress was made in implementing the 112 single European emergency number. The Law on electronic communications aiming to further align with the European Electronic Communications Code Directive entered into force in December 2024. The Broadband Competence Office (BCO) is operational since January 2025. However, its staffing is still in process.

By the end of 2024, fixed internet broadband showed a 10% increase in comparison to 2023. A gap in fixed internet broadband penetration between urban and rural areas remains. Rural areas, comprising around 40% of the total population, have only 19.5% of the fixed broadband connections. The broadband penetration rate for families at the end of 2024 was up to 92%, (88% in 2023). By 2024, the data volume of active mobile broadband was increased by 15.4% compared with 2023.

In November 2024, the Electronic and Postal Communications Authority (AKEP) has granted authorisation for the use of frequencies in the 3.5 GHz band by Vodafone and One Albania, thus paving the way for the implementation of 5G technology in Albania.However, the country still needs to release the 700 MHz band from broadcasting use to allow its use for mobile communications, including 5G.

In the area of digital services, as regards online public services, during the reporting period 95% of applications for 1 253 public services were offered online. Albania should enhance its efforts to align with the Digital Services Act (DSA), as well as with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in line with the steps proposed at a TAIEX meeting held in February 2025. There is a need to address the emerging digital divide and strengthen the ability of citizens to independently use e-services. In March 2025, the government decided to suspend access to a major social media platform nationwide (see Chapter 23 – Judiciary and Fundamental Rights).

Albania has also significantly contributed to cross-border interoperability in capacity building exercises considering the monitoring mechanism under the Interoperable Europe Act.

On digital skills, the ICT curricula for first, second, and third grade are in place and being taught at the smart labs in 100 pilot schools.

Under digital trust and cybersecurity, Albania has continued to strengthen its cybersecurity architecture and capacities. The authorities need to continue their efforts, in the field of critical information infrastructure, both in the public and private sector, and ensure that the new national security operations centre becomes fully operational. In June 2025, the Government adopted an updated list of operators of critical and important information infrastructure.

Cybersecurity capacities need to be further strengthened, including through awareness-raising activities and trainings.The new Cybersecurity Strategy 2025-2030 and its Action Plan 2025-2027 have been adopted. Implementation of the EU 5G Cybersecurity Toolbox measures should continue. Albania should adopt the Law on electronic identification and trust services, to align with the European Digital Identity regulation.

Further efforts are needed for the alignment with the ePrivacy Directive. On media, no legislative developments took place. Authorities need to ensure that the Audiovisual Media Authority is provided with sufficient material and technical resources to increase its media monitoring and reporting capacity.

Albania should fully align with the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act, ensuring the necessary enforcement structures.

Chapter 16: Taxation

EU rules on taxation cover value-added tax, excise duties as well as aspects of corporate taxation. They also cover cooperation between tax administrations, including the exchange of information to prevent tax evasion.

The Council of Ministers adopted the medium-term revenue strategy (MTRS) 2024-2027 in December 2024. This includes a commitment to complete a comprehensive review of tax exemptions, including under direct taxation, by mid-2025. Albania has completed this evaluation of exemptions in June 2025.

On indirect taxation, the standard VAT rate is 20% and the reduced rates are 6% and 10%. A substantial number of tax exemptions not set out in the EU acquis remains and none were removed in the reporting period. No major changes to the VAT regulations aiming at further harmonisation with the EU acquis were introduced in the reporting period. At the same time the VAT rate of 6% for services provided in five-star hotels was extended till end of 2026.

Excise taxation is partially aligned with the EU acquis regarding excise duty for alcohol and alcoholic beverages, tobacco, energy products and general rules for the production, keeping, storage, movement and controls on excisable products. Alignment on EU excise minima on tobacco products is ongoing, through a gradual and scheduled increase of cigarette excise rates from 2025 to 2033, which continued to be applied. Albania still needs to move to a mixed excise duty structure (ad valorem and specific) for cigarettes. National legislation providing for a preferential rate of tax for ‘Albanian rakia’ produced by private individuals is not aligned with EU legislation. National legislation is aligned with the EU law on excise duty for energy products, with the exception of electricity and natural gas, which are not subject to excise duty in Albania. Excise rate on some fuel products are still below the minimum according to EU directives. The Excise Movement and Control System has been set up at national level.

On direct taxation, the income tax law is partially aligned with the EU acquis. Analysing EU direct tax legislation and transposition into the domestic legislation has started. By December 2025, it is estimated to do the first drafting of alignment, and a full alignment is planned by 2027.

Albania should ensure that any future voluntary tax compliance law is in line with the EU acquis and international standards.

Albania needs to revise the national tax legislation which imposes tax on imported plastic as good/raw material, to ensure alignment with its commitment under the SAA.

On administrative cooperation and mutual assistance, Albania has double taxation agreement with 23 Member States and committed to conclude agreements with the four outstanding ones – Denmark, Cyprus, Portugal and Lithuania.

The Law on automatic exchange of financial account information applies the OECD provisions and Albania has expanded the number of jurisdictions with which it exchanges information. Albania has automatically exchanged financial account information with 80 jurisdictions (including 26 EU Member States) in 2024 and has received information from 65 jurisdictions (of which 22 EU Member States) within the framework of the OECD common reporting standard. A framework for country-by-country reporting as per OECD BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) is in place, and initial country-by-country reporting exchange is under preparation for 2026. In March 2025, the Council of Ministers approved in principle the Subject to Tax Rule (STTR) multilateral instrument, allowing the signature procedure to be initiated.

On operational capacity, there were 179 vacancies in the tax administration remains at the end July 2025 (in 2024, and till 31 July 2025 there were 148 recruitments, 97 left or resigned and 15 dismissals). Digitisation of the fiscalisation process is considered fully complete, although further work on the use of the generated data is necessary, as well as increase the use of third-party data. Furthermore, Albania should continue to prepare for achieving interconnection and interoperability with EU system.

Chapter 17: Economic and monetary policy

EU rules require the independence of central banks and prohibit them from directly financing the public sector. Member States coordinate their economic policies and are subject to fiscal, economic and financial surveillance.

On monetary policy, Albania has a high level of alignment with the EU acquis on the prohibition of privileged access of the public sector to financial institutions. The legislation of Albania is partly aligned with the EU acquis on the central bank independence and on the prohibition of monetary financing to the public sector. A working group was established in July to begin work on amending the Central Bank law to align with the acquis. Albania needs to take the necessary steps to fully align its legal framework with the EU acquis regarding full independence of the BoA, prohibition of monetary financing of the public sector and prohibition of privileged access. Albania also needs to ensure that national legislation, including the statutes of its central bank, is compatible with the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Banks.

On economic policy, fiscal rules, including those on the primary balance and the debt ratio, were met in 2024 (see also Section 2.3 - Economic criteria).Budget revisions continued to be endorsed through normative acts in 2024, similar to the practice in the previous years. Albania does not have a fiscal council yet, but preparatory work for setting up such an institution began. Albania works on revising the pension scheme, a process which would have to address the gap in the social insurance scheme, including strengthening long-term fiscal projections and a revision of methodology for setting the minimum and maximum pensions.

Albania is partially aligned with the requirements on the coordination and surveillance of economic policies laid down by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Its active participation in Economic Reform Programme (ERP) exercise, including the latest one for 2025-2027 has contributed to developing the administrative capacity of the country relevant for this Chapter. Albania’s ERP outlined the country’s key macroeconomic and fiscal policies. The policy guidance jointly adopted at the 2024 Economic and Financial Dialogue has been partially implemented. Albania’s ERP would benefit from the inclusion of long-term sustainability of public finance and productivity indicators, improved analysis of key fiscal measures and their budgetary impact, fiscal risks and a more effective public consultation.

Chapter 19: Social policy and employment

EU rules in the social field include minimum standards for labour law, equality, and non-discrimination, health and safety at work. They also promote social inclusion and social protection, and social dialogue at EU level.

On health and safety at work, Albania has adopted the Policy Document for Health and Safety at Work and its Action Plan 2025–2030, in line with the EU strategic framework on health and safety at work 2021-2027. The establishment of the Interministerial Council of Occupational Health and Safety and its secretariat is still pending. The revised labour law is being implemented.

On labour inspection activities, the launch of intelligent risk assessment matrices led to 75% of total inspections (9 860) being planned on risk-based assessment. Despite the very limited capacities of the social services inspectorate, the number of the inspections increased to 126 in 2024 (comparing to 108 in 2023). The capacities of the social services inspectorate need to be strengthened. In 2024, 90% of work-related accidents were reported by employers, a 2.4% increase from 2023, indicating a steady level of reporting and investigation. The Interface between the Intelligent Risk Assessment Matrices (MIRA) with the e-inspection platform would increase the efficiency of the Labour and Social Services Inspectorate’s work.

On social dialogue, the tripartite consultation process needs to be improved. T he National Labour Council convened only twice in the reporting period while the tripartite collaboration remained insufficient. Capacity building for social partners needs to continue.

On employment policy, the implementation of the 2023-2030 national employment and skills strategy continued. The piloting of the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan is extended until the end of 2027. The amended Law on youth, adopted in April 2025, includes key provisions on young people not in employment, education or training (NEET) and will enable the Institute of Statistics to produce national and regional profile reports. During 2024, 508 NEET (58% women) identified with mapped needs were referred to appropriate offers, with 66% positive exit rate. 13% of them belong to vulnerable groups (mainly Roma/Egyptians, youth with disabilities, or returned migrants). Progress continues in the implementation of the exit strategy for recipients of economic aid. Piloting and implementation of the Employment Promotion Program on Social Reintegration is set to start by the end of 2025.The program targets the inclusion in the labour market of long term unemployed jobseekers.

In terms of vocational training (VET), 4 191 beneficiaries of economic aid were employed, or enrolled in 2024, compared with 4 158 in 2023. The subsidies to the development of digital skills and coding continued in 2024 with 845 participants (out of which 53 were unemployed). Employment rate increased in 2024 to 68.3% (66.5% in 2023).

For labour force participation and unemployment rate see the statistical annex and the section on the functioning of the labour market under 2.3 Economic criteria.

On social protection and inclusion, the Strategy for Social Protection is being implemented. In April 2025, the government organised a Regional Event on Accelerating Childcare Reforms towards EU Accession as a starting point for the Child Guarantee Plan, as part of the strategy. Albania has nominated a national Contact Point for the European Child Guarantee. The Survey on Income and Living conditions published in February 2024 showed that 19.7% of the population was at risk of poverty. In the reporting period, this proportion remained high for children, standing at 26.5%, with girls more affected (27.3%). Measures taken to address poverty have been insufficient. For 2025, total budget for Social Fund increased by 14%, funding for 57 services at the municipal level and 19 Specialised Care Services at the regional level. No mechanism is yet in place on the establishment and implementation of an indexation mechanism of the Economic Aid benefits. Domestic child trafficking forced begging and child labour are a concern despite policies that are consistent with international standards.

Progress was made in the monitoring of the N ational Action Plan on the Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities 2021-2025. Efforts have been made to ensure accessibility for persons with disabilities to different institutions, although often this is related only to physical accessibility.

![Image 39](blob:http://localhost/d2bc58fa4700b9e0892b5ccb2527976c)On the inclusion of Roma and Egyptians, further efforts are needed to improve the human resources allocated within the Ministry of Health and Social Protection to the coordination of Roma-related policies, as well as to increase labour market mobility and tackle discrimination. The National Electronic Register of Social Care Services is not fully functional. These efforts were also linked with the application and monitoring of the support provided through the Social Fund. Challenges persist, including staffing, hardware shortages, and concerns about the software user-friendliness. In July 2025 Albania appointed a Deputy Minister of Health and Social Protection from the Roma community responsible for social inclusion.

On non-discrimination in employment and social policy, full alignment with EU legislation still needs to be completed, especially with the Employment Equality Directive and the Racial Equality Directive. The number of persons with disabilities registering as jobseekers increased to 8 000 in 2024 (2 656 in 2023).

On equality between women and men in employment and social policy, gender inequality in employment remains, with the employment rate gap between men and women extending to 13% in 2024 (10.4% in 2023). The unemployment rate for men was 8.0%, while for women was 9.6%. The NEET rate among youth remains high with 2.1 points higher for women (25.6%) than men (23.5%). The gender pay gap in wages narrowed to 4.9% as compared to 6.2% in the previous year.

Albania still has to align its legislation with the gender equality acquis in the area of social policies and employment, including work-life balance, pay transparency and women on boards.

Chapter 20: Enterprise and industrial policy

EU industrial policy strengthens competitiveness, facilitates structural change and encourages a business-friendly environment that stimulates small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

On enterprise and industrial policy principles, Albania adopted the Smart Specialisation Strategy in December 2024 (see Chapter 25 – Science and research) and in April a mid-term monitoring report on the implementation of the Business Investment and Development Strategy (BIDS). A decision on amending the BIDS has been approved in 2025, that focuses on SME internationalisation and skills, but hardly remedies reported weak implementation progress.In February 2025 Parliament adopted some amendments to the Law on strategic investment, which among others extended its effects until end 2026. The Albanian Investment Development Agency has completed and put online the Export platform, aiming to support the internationalization of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.

Despite further improvements, concerns remain among business representatives on the level of public consultation by the government and Parliament, especially regarding EU integration. Businesses complain of undue bureaucratic burdens and call for clearer procedures and deadlines. Clarity on implementation of legal acts would eliminate the ‘grey zone’ which might serve as an area on which specific businesses might take advantage in exchange of favours/corruptive actions. Progress on justice reform and anti-corruption are welcomed by business.

On enterprise and industrial policy instruments, further coordination between state institutions which provide financial incentives to businesses remains needed, to ensure better access to information for the beneficiaries and to focus efforts of the BIDS which are related such as AIDA investment promotion, TEDA specialisation and SME supplier support. Further alignment with the EU’s late payment Directive needs be ensured. Albania’s definition of SMEs is partly aligned with the EU Recommendation, on the number of employees, but the national capacity to support SMEs remains limited. Albania was positively assessed in the 2024 OECD competitiveness outlook, marking progress in 14 out of 15 dimensions, stagnating in one, state-owned enterprises.

On sectoral policies, Albania extended to 2026 the period of application for tax incentives to investors involved in the construction/development of 5-star hotels. It introduced also a ‘mountain package’ to enhance investment in the mountain areas which include tax free incentives, that would require high attention on preserving Albania’s ecological and biodiversity values. In March 2025 Albania was the official Host Country

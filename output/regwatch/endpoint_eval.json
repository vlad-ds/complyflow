The requirements relating to such a cyber resilience strategy and framework should be based on the Cyber resilience oversight expectations for financial market infrastructures[(4)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32025R1355#ntr4-L_202501355EN.000101-E0004) with the purpose of rendering some key expectations legally binding for SIPS operators. Moreover, it is essential that a SIPS operator periodically tests the effectiveness of the SIPS controls and systems by performing threat led penetration testing in accordance with the European Framework for Threat Intelligence-based Ethical Red Teaming (TIBER-EU)[(5)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32025R1355#ntr5-L_202501355EN.000101-E0005) (hereinafter the \u2018TIBER-EU framework\u2019).

The CPMI-IOSCO recommends implementing these principles to the fullest extent allowed by the national legal and regulatory frameworks. To ensure the efficiency of the oversight of payment systems, the European Central Bank (ECB) implemented these principles, by means of Regulation (EU) No 795/2014 (ECB/2014/28), which applies to both large-value payment systems and retail payment systems of systemic importance.\n\n(5)This Regulation applies to payment systems operated both by central banks and by private operators. That said, the CPMI-IOSCO principles acknowledge that there are exceptional cases where they are applied differently to payment systems operated by central banks due to requirements laid down in relevant law, regulation, or policy. Given that the Eurosystem has public policy objectives, responsibilities and an institutional set-up defined in the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB, Eurosystem systemically important payment systems (SIPS) may be exempted from certain requirements under this Regulation. In particular, Eurosystem SIPS should be exempted from specific requirements on governance, wind-down plans, equity and liquid assets, collateral and investment risks, which cover the same areas as the respective requirements formally adopted by the Governing Council. These exemptions are specified in several provisions of the Regulation.",

The CPMI-IOSCO recommends implementing these principles to the fullest extent allowed by the national legal and regulatory frameworks. To ensure the efficiency of the oversight of payment systems, the European Central Bank (ECB) implemented these principles, by means of Regulation (EU) No 795/2014 (ECB/2014/28), which applies to both large-value payment systems and retail payment systems of systemic importance.\n\n(5)This Regulation applies to payment systems operated both by central banks and by private operators. That said, the CPMI-IOSCO principles acknowledge that there are exceptional cases where they are applied differently to payment systems operated by central banks due to requirements laid down in relevant law, regulation, or policy. Given that the Eurosystem has public policy objectives, responsibilities and an institutional set-up defined in the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB, Eurosystem systemically important payment systems (SIPS) may be exempted from certain requirements under this Regulation. In particular, Eurosystem SIPS should be exempted from specific requirements on governance, wind-down plans, equity and liquid assets, collateral and investment risks, which cover the same areas as the respective requirements formally adopted by the Governing Council.

Furthermore, in order to ensure the integrity of the members of the Board and the Management, and where applicable the Branch Management, a SIPS operator should consider any record of the members in respect of convictions or penalties for breaches of the applicable commercial law, insolvency law, financial services law, anti-money laundering law and counter-terrorist financing law and breaches of professional duty as well as for fraud.\n\n(16)Furthermore, a sound and evolving framework to comprehensively manage legal, credit, liquidity, operational, general business, custody, investment and other risks is essential to identify, measure, monitor and manage the entire range of risks that arise in the operation of a SIPS or are borne by a SIPS operator.

In order to meet requests for redemption, issuers of asset-referenced tokens or e-money tokens should pay particular attention to the volatility of the assets referenced relative to the reserve of assets and should perform a subsequent analysis of the necessary overcollateralisation. To mitigate any counterparty risk, issuers of asset-referenced tokens or e-money tokens should avoid risks of concentration of the custodians of the reserve of assets.\n\n(3)Issuers of asset-referenced tokens or e-money tokens should establish a liquidity contingency plan with early warning signals and liquidity risk mitigation tools. In particular, issuers of asset-referenced tokens or e-money tokens should monitor as an early warning signal the volatility of assets referenced relative to the reserve of assets and the evolution of any gap between the market value of the tokens and the market value of the assets referenced, in order to anticipate potential material redemption requests, particularly in view of any potential underestimation of the market value of tokens in the market. Given that an overestimation of the market value of a token might create an incentive to sell it, issuers of asset-referenced tokens or e-money tokens should pay attention to transaction volumes and prices in order to be ready to react to any adverse evolution in the market of the tokens.\n\n(4)As a reserve of assets for one asset-referenced token or e-money token is segregated from a reserve of assets of other such tokens, the liquidity management policy and procedures related to each of them should also be set out seperately.",

Given that an overestimation of the market value of a token might create an incentive to sell it, issuers of asset-referenced tokens or e-money tokens should pay attention to transaction volumes and prices in order to be ready to react to any adverse evolution in the market of the tokens.\n\n(4)As a reserve of assets for one asset-referenced token or e-money token is segregated from a reserve of assets of other such tokens, the liquidity management policy and procedures related to each of them should also be set out seperately.",

While those acts covered the main categories of financial risk (e.g. credit risk, market risk, counterparty credit risk and liquidity risk, market conduct risk), they did not comprehensively tackle, at the time of their adoption, all components of operational resilience. The operational risk rules, when further developed in those Union legal acts, often favoured a traditional quantitative approach to addressing risk (namely setting a capital requirement to cover ICT risk) rather than targeted qualitative rules for the protection, detection, containment, recovery and repair capabilities against ICT-related incidents, or for reporting and digital testing capabilities. Those acts were primarily meant to cover and update essential rules on prudential supervision, market integrity or conduct. By consolidating and upgrading the different rules on ICT risk, all provisions addressing digital risk in the financial sector should for the first time be brought together in a consistent manner in one single legislative act. Therefore, this Regulation fills in the gaps or remedies inconsistencies in some of the prior legal acts, including in relation to the terminology used therein, and explicitly refers to ICT risk via targeted rules on ICT risk-management capabilities, incident reporting, operational resilience testing and ICT third-party risk monitoring. This Regulation should thus also raise awareness of ICT risk and acknowledge that ICT incidents and a lack of operational resilience have the possibility to jeopardise the soundness of financial entities.",

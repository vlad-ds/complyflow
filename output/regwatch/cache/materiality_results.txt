    "analyzed_at": "2025-12-07T14:07:42.637963",
    "is_material": true,
    "relevance": "high",
    "summary": "ESRB recommends the Commission and EU authorities treat third-country multi-issuer stablecoin schemes as either impermissible under MiCAR or subject to strict equivalence, supervision, cross-border reserve mobility and cooperation requirements to mitigate financial stability risks.",
    "impact": "This could materially affect BIT Capital\u2019s crypto operations and funds by restricting use/availability of certain cross-jurisdictional stablecoins (EMTs/ARTs), increasing custody/operational and liquidity risk, and creating new due-diligence, reporting and supervisory obligations for funds and service providers.",
    "action_required": "Immediate review of fund exposures to EMTs/ARTs and counterparties (issuers, CASPs, custodians); engage legal/compliance to track Commission/legislative follow-up and prepare prospectus/PSR updates, contingency liquidity/redemption plans, and enhanced due-diligence and custody agreements.",
